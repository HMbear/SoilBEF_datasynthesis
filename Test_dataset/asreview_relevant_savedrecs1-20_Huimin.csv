7,JOUR,"['Xie, QH', 'Yao, XB', 'Yang, Y', 'Li, DJ', 'Qi, JY']",Effects of Deep Application of Fertilizer on Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Functions in Rice Paddies,AGRONOMY-BASEL,"Efficient fertilization is vital for rice production and sustainable agriculture. Conventional fertilization (CK) suffers from low efficiency and environmental pollution, whereas side-deep fertilization (SF) offers an efficient, eco-friendly alternative. The changes in microbial carbon cycling functional genes induced by SF in paddy soils remain unclear. This study investigates the effects of SF and CK on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), microbial communities, and carbon- and nitrogen-cycling genes in double-cropping rice paddies through field experiments. Results reveal that SF significantly increases TN in deeper soil layers (10-20 cm), enhancing the expression of nitrogen fixation genes (e.g., K02591 and K02588) and nitrogen metabolism pathways, alongside boosting Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes abundance. In contrast, CK promotes SOC accumulation and upregulates carbon metabolism genes (e.g., K01179 and K01728) in surface layers (0-10 cm). In deeper layers, SF elevates nitrogen reduction gene abundance (e.g., K02591) while suppressing denitrification and assimilatory nitrate reduction, whereas CK enhances dissimilatory nitrate reduction (e.g., K02568). Redundancy analysis (RDA) shows that soil properties (pH, SOC, and TN) drive microbial community structure, with Actinobacteria positively linked to SOC and TN. These findings demonstrate that SF optimizes nitrogen cycling in deeper soil by improving nitrogen use efficiency and functional microbial growth, while CK favors shallow-layer carbon sequestration. This study provides a scientific foundation for tailoring fertilization strategies to soil depth, leveraging carbon- and nitrogen-cycling gene dynamics to enhance soil fertility and sustainability in rice production.",2073-4395,APR 11,2025,15,938,10.3390/agronomy15040938,,WOS:001474748500001,4,,,1,2025-11-02 21:59:44,C

However, the regulatory effects of biotic and abiotic factors on ecosystem function and EMF still need further study, under the background of altitude at large regional scales. We established a 1500-km sampling area along the altitude gradient in alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. With increasing altitude, bacterial and fungal community diversity increased, microbial network complexity and EMF showed unimodal variation patterns, range of 0.36-0.48. EMF thresholds exist at 3786 m altitude. At this threshold, maximum means occurred for productivity indicators (0.24), carbon cycling indicators (0.080), nitrogen cycling indicators (0.026), and phosphorus cycle indicators (0.0089). Bacterial communities are more sensitive than fungal communities to changes in altitude, vegetation and pH. Annual mean temperature (MAT) modifies soil microbial primarily indirectly through its effects on plants and soil. Both microbial diversity and network complexity are positively correlated with EMF, and microbial network complexity plays a more important role in predicting EMF. Bacterial communities are the main drivers of multifunctionality compared to fungi. MAT is the main environmental drivers of EMF. MAP, microbial diversity was positively correlated with productivity and nitrogen cycling indicators.

In this study, we utilized novel materials, unfunctionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-OH), to explore the effects of soil carbon and nitrogen cycles in saline soil. We set up four treatments, which were exposed to two exposure doses of 1 g/kg and 1 mu g/kg and two MWCNT types of functionalized MWCNT-OH and unfunctionalized MWCNT. Our results demonstrate that exposure of saline soil to 1 g/kg functionalized MWCNT-OH significantly increased the soil inorganic nitrogen (p < 0.05), while also promoting the soil microbial biomass. This exposure can also potentially enhance greenhouse gas emissions from saline soil. Moreover, exposure to MWCNTs significantly increased the proportion of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, two dominant phyla (p < 0.05), which in turn improved their contribution to the carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within saline soil. High exposure dose treatments (1 g/kg) significantly increased the abundance of functional genes associated with carbon metabolism, carbon fixation, methane metabolism, and nitrogen cycling processes within saline soil. In contrast, low exposure dose treatments (1 mu g/kg) had no significant effect on the abundance of functional genes related to nitrogen cycling, but significantly increased the abundance of special functional genes related to carbon cycling. Redundancy analysis revealed that the microbial community composition within saline soil was significantly impacted by the soil total carbon, total nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen content. Furthermore, it was observed that over 80% of the carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within the saline soil were contributed by the dominant phyla. In summary, our research confirms the potential applicability of MWCNTs within saline soil.

We analyzed the samples for physicochemical properties, microbial amplicon sequencing, and metagenomic sequencing. Correlation analyses were conducted between microbial community structure, functional genes, and environmental factors to identify the drivers of microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling.ResultsBacterial richness was 6.03% lower in steppe soils compared to wet meadow soils. Steppe soils exhibited the highest aerobic respiration potential, while deeper wet meadow soils had enhanced anaerobic carbon fixation potential and a higher abundance of carbon decomposition-related genes. Nitrogen assimilation was highest in steppe surface soils, whereas denitrification and ammonification were greatest in wet meadow soils. Carbon cycling potential was influenced by total soil carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and belowground biomass, while nitrogen cycling was driven by belowground biomass, soil moisture, and pH.ConclusionOur findings underscore the role of environmental factors in microbial functional gene distribution, providing new insights for modeling carbon and nitrogen cycling in alpine permafrost ecosystems under climate change.",0032-079X,SEP,2025,514,,10.1007/s11104-025-07472-w,APR 2025,WOS:001472168000001,1,1507,1525,1,2025-11-02 22:07:14,C

Meanwhile, a gap remains in understanding the combined influence of soil salinity and aggregate size on microbial communities. The current study provided insight into the joint effects of soil salinity and aggregate size on the microbial function of saline soil, specifically in terms of carbon and nitrogen cycling.MethodsThe study was conducted in a rice field of Tiaozini Wetland (32 degrees 76.0'N, 120 degrees 96.3'E), located in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China. In this experiment, the low salinity and high salinity soils were divided into four size aggregates, respectively. The soil's physicochemical properties, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and 16S sequencing were determined.ResultsWe found that the MBC decreased as salinity increased, except in the 53-250 mu m aggregates. High salinity inhibited the predicted abundance of functional genes involved in microbial carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, chemolithotrophy, and nitrogen metabolism. Conversely, it significantly improved the predicted abundance of functional genes involved in nitrite ammonification.ConclusionsThe 250-2000 mu m soil aggregates under low salinity conditions had the most significant positive impact on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. The impact of salinity and aggregate size on predicted functional genes related to carbon cycling was greater than that on nitrogen cycling.

In this study, we collected paired reforested and cropland soils from 30 sites in the southwestern China to comprehensively investigate the impacts of reforestation on soil microbial functional genes related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling. Microbial diversity, functional profiles, and functional gene copies were determined through amplicon sequencing, metagenomic analysis, and real-time PCR. We found that reforestation significantly decreased the average copy number of the 16S rRNA operon and altered the soil microbial community structure. Reforestation also substantially increased the abundances of most microbial functional genes involved in carbon (e.g., carbon degradation and fixation), nitrogen (e.g., nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation, and denitrification), and phosphorus (e.g., inorganic phosphorus solubilization, organic phosphorus mineralization, and phosphorus transportation) cycling. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling gene abundances were significantly correlated with multiple environmental factors, including soil moisture, total nitrogen, total carbon, and NH4+-N, in both cropland and reforested ecosystems. Notably, they showed significant correlations with the soil available potassium and NO3--N contents specifically within the reforested soils rather than the cropland soils. Additionally, reforestation substantially simplified the co-occurrence network constructed with soil microbial carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling genes.

The response of microbial functions involved in the nutrient cycle to soil salinization is a valuable scientific question. However, our knowledge of the microbial metabolism functions in salinized soil and their response to salinity in arid desert environments is inadequate.Methods Here, we applied metagenomics technology to investigate the response of microbial carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) cycling and the key genes to salinity, and discuss the effects of edaphic variables on microbial functions.Results We found that carbon fixation dominated the carbon cycle. Nitrogen fixation, denitrification, assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA), and nitrogen degradation were commonly identified as the most abundant processes in the nitrogen cycle. Organic phosphorus dissolution and phosphorus absorption/transport were the most enriched P metabolic functions, while sulfur metabolism was dominated by assimilatory sulfate reduction (ASR), organic sulfur transformation, and linkages between inorganic and organic sulfur transformation. Increasing salinity inhibited carbon degradation, nitrogen fixation, nitrogen degradation, anammox, ANRA, phosphorus absorption and transport, and the majority of processes in sulfur metabolism. However, some of the metabolic pathway and key genes showed a positive response to salinization, such as carbon fixation (facA, pccA, korAB), denitrification (narG, nirK, norBC, nosZ), ANRA (nasA, nirA), and organic phosphorus dissolution processes (pstABCS, phnCD, ugpAB). High salinity reduced the network complexity in the soil communities. Even so, the saline microbial community presented highly cooperative interactions. The soil water content had significantly correlations with C metabolic genes. The SOC, N, and P contents were significantly correlated with C, N, P, and S network complexity and functional genes. AP, NH4+, and NO3- directly promote carbon fixation, denitrification, nitrogen degradation, organic P solubilization and mineralization, P uptake and transport, ASR, and organic sulfur transformation processes.Conclusion Soil salinity in arid region inhibited multiple metabolic functions, but prompted the function of carbon fixation, denitrification, ANRA, and organic phosphorus dissolution.

Microbial communities in the rhizosphere enhance plants' health and promote nutrient turnover and cycling in the soil. In this study, we evaluated the effects of soil fertilization with organic and inorganic fertilizers on the abundances and distribution of carbon and nitrogen cycling genes within the rhizosphere of maize plants. Our result showed that maize plants through rhizosphere effects selected and enriched the same functional genes glnA, gltB, gudB involved in nitrogen cycle as do high compost and low inorganic fertilizer treatments. This observation was significantly different from those of high doses of inorganic fertilizer and low compost manure treated soil. Only alpha amylase encoding genes were selectively enriched by low compost and high inorganic fertilized soil. The other treatments only selected xynB (in Cp8), lacZ (Cp4), bglA, pldB, trpA (N2), uidA (N1) and glgC, vanA (Cn0) carbon cycling genes in the rhizosphere of maize. Also Actinomycetales are selected by high compost, low inorganic fertilizer and control. The control was without any fertilization and the soil was planted with maize. Bacillales are also promoted by low compost and high inorganic fertilizer. This indicated that only microbes capable of tolerating the stress of high dose of inorganic fertilizer will thrive under such condition. Therefore, soil fertilization lowers nitrogen gas emission as seen with the high abundance of nitrogen assimilation genes or microbial anabolic genes, but increases carbon dioxide evolution in the agricultural soil by promoting the abundance of catabolic genes involve in carbon cycling.",2191-0855,FEB 8,2021,11,24,10.1186/s13568-021-01182-z,,WOS:000616314000001,1,,,1,2025-11-02 22:11:30,Not sure

Recently, soil transplant has been successfully established as a proxy to simulate climate changes, as the current trend of global warming coherently causes range shifts toward higher latitudes. Four years after southward soil transplant over large transects in China, we found that microbial functional diversity was increased, in addition to concurrent changes in microbial biomass, soil nutrient content and functional processes involved in the nitrogen cycle. However, soil transplant effects could be overridden by maize cropping, which was attributed to a negative interaction. Strikingly, abundances of nitrogen and carbon cycle genes were increased by these field experiments simulating global change, coinciding with higher soil nitrification potential and carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux. Further investigation revealed strong correlations between carbon cycle genes and CO2 efflux in bare soil but not cropped soil, and between nitrogen cycle genes and nitrification.

Under fungicide stress, nitrogen-cycling microorganisms (e.g., Nitrososphaerota and Mucoromycota) increased in relative abundance, while carbon cycle-related microorganisms (e.g., Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota) generally declined. AMF colonization improved microbial resilience, demonstrated by a 312 % rise in Rhizophagus abundance and significant increases in phosphorus-cycling microorganisms (e.g., Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium).

To investigate the soil microbialmediated carbon and nitrogen cycling patterns accompanying primary succession, we selected three types of tailings ponds as study areas and set up sampling sites for different stages of primary succession. The results showed that primary succession promoted microbe-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling. It also led to improvements in soil nutrient availability and enzyme activity. In primary succession, the main pathways of carbon cycling are 3HP and rTCA, and nitrogen cycling is nitrate assimilation. In the early stages, microbes mediated more anaerobic and microaerobic processes. As succession proceeded, the pattern of microbial contributions to the carbon and nitrogen cycles changed. As succession proceeds, the functional metabolic potential of the carbon cycle gradually rises, while the nitrogen cycle shows a dramatic increase after the accumulation of autotrophic biomass.

Several observations show that the effects of global change on primary production and carbon storage in plant biomass and soils are partially controlled by N availability. Nevertheless, only a small number of terrestrial biosphere models represent explicitly the nitrogen cycle, despite its importance on the carbon cycle and on climate. These models are difficult to evaluate at large spatiotemporal scales because of the scarcity of data at the global scale over a long time period. In this study, we benchmark the capacity of the O-CN global terrestrial biosphere model to reproduce temporal changes in leaf area index (LAI) at the global scale observed by NOAA_AVHRR satellites over the period 1982-2002. Using a satellite LAI product based on the normalized difference vegetation index of global inventory monitoring and modelling studies dataset, we estimate the long-term trend of LAI and we compare it with the results from the terrestrial biosphere models, either with (O-CN) or without (O-C) a dynamic nitrogen cycle coupled to the carbon-water-energy cycles. In boreal and temperate regions, including a dynamic N cycle (O-CN) improved the fit between observed and modeled temporal changes in LAI. In contrast, in the tropics, simulated LAI from the model without the dynamic N cycle (O-C) better matched observed changes in LAI over time. Despite differential regional trends, the satellite estimate suggests an increase in the global average LAI during 1982-2002 by 0.0020 m(2) m(-2) y(-1). Both versions of the model substantially overestimated the rate of change in LAI over time (0.0065 m(2) m(-2) y(-1) for O-C and 0.0057 m(2) m(-2) y(-1) for O-CN), suggesting that some additional limitation mechanisms are missing in the model. We also estimated the relative importance of climate, CO2 and N deposition as potential drivers of the temporal changes in LAI. We found that recent climate change better explained temporal changes in LAI when the dynamic N cycle was included in the model (higher ranked fit for O-CN vs. O-C). Using the O-C configuration to estimate the direct effect of climate on LAI, we quantified the importance of climate-N cycle feedbacks in explaining the LAI response. We found that the warming-induced release of N from soil organic matter decomposition explains 17.5 % of the global trend in LAI over time, however, reaching up to 40.9 % explained variance in the boreal zone, which is a more important contribution than increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. Our analysis supports a strong connection between warming, N cycling, and vegetation productivity. These findings underscore the importance of including N cycling in global-scale models of vegetation response to environmental change.",0930-7575,MAY,2013,40,,10.1007/s00382-012-1388-y,,WOS:000318278700022,9-10,2535,2548,0,2025-11-02 22:18:59,Not about soil

Soil health is the backbone of a resilient environment and stable food production systems. In recent years, the use of biochar to bind nutrients, sorption of pollutants, and increase crop productivity has gained popularity. This article reviews key recent studies on the environmental impacts of biochar and the benefits of its unique physicochemical features in paddy soils. This review provides critical information on the role of biochar properties on environmental pollutants, carbon and nitrogen cycling, plant growth regulation, and microbial activities. Biochar improves the soil properties of paddy soils through increasing microbial activities and nutrient availability, accelerating carbon and nitrogen cycle, and reducing the availability of heavy metals and micropollutants. For example, a study showed that the application of a maximum of 40 t ha-1 of biochar from rice husks prior to cultivation (at high temperature and slow pyrolysis) increases nutrient utilization and rice grain yield by 40%. Biochar can be used to minimize the use of chemical fertilizers to ensure sustainable food production.",0147-6513,SEP 15,2023,263,115228,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115228,JUL 2023,WOS:001039279500001,,,,0,2025-11-02 22:19:51,Review

We quantified the magnitude of, and underlying controls on, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycled by invertebrate herbivory along a 2800m elevational gradient in the tropical Andes spanning 12 degrees C mean annual temperature. We find, firstly, that leaf area loss is greater at warmer sites with lower foliar phosphorus, and secondly, that the estimated herbivore-mediated flux of foliar nitrogen and phosphorus from plants to soil via leaf area loss is similar to, or greater than, other major sources of these nutrients in tropical forests. Finally, we estimate that herbivores consume a significant portion of plant carbon, potentially causing major shifts in the pattern of plant and soil carbon cycling. We conclude that future shifts in herbivore abundance and activity as a result of environmental change could have major impacts on soil fertility and ecosystem carbon sequestration in tropical forests.",1461-023X,MAR,2014,17,,10.1111/ele.12233,,WOS:000329823300007,3,324,332,0,2025-11-02 22:20:50,No soil biodiversity mentioned

TI  - Diversity and function of fungi in peatlands: A carbon cycling perspective
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
CP  - Conference on Science of Changing Climates - Impact on Agriculture, Forestry and Wetlands
AB  - Peatlands are a dominant landform in the northern hemisphere, accumulating carbon in the form of peat due to an imbalance between decomposition and plant production rates. Decomposer (saprobes) and mycorrhizal fungi significantly influence carbon dynamics by degrading organic matter via the synthesis of extracellular enzymes. As organic matter decomposes, litter quality variables figure most prominently in the succession of fungi. Hence, litters composed primarily of complex polymers decompose very slowly. Surprisingly, recalcitrant polymer degraders (mostly basidiomycetes) are rarely isolated from peat, which may explain the accumulation of complex polymers in peat profiles. While enzymatic profiles of mycorrhizal fungi and other root endophytes may be more limited compared with saprobes, many of these fungi can degrade polymers of varying complexity as well and hence may also be significant decomposers of organic matter. To date, anamorphic ascomycetes and zygomycetes are the most frequently isolated fungi from peatlands (63 and 10% of all taxa, respectively), and chytridiomycetes, teleomorphic ascomycetes, and basidiomycetes appear to be less common (11% of all taxa). The remaining 16% of taxa remain unidentified or are sterile taxa. How disturbances affect peatland microbial communities and their roles is virtually unknown. This aspect of peatland microbial ecology requires immediate attention. The objective of this paper is to review the current state of knowledge of the diversity of fungi and their roles in carbon cycling dynamics in peatlands.

TI  - Nitrification driven by bacteria and not archaea in nitrogen-rich grassland soils
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB  - The oxidation of ammonia to nitrate, nitrification, is a key process in the nitrogen cycle. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea are present in large numbers in the ocean(1-3) and soils(4-6), suggesting a potential role for archaea, in addition to bacteria, in the global nitrogen cycle(7,8). However, the importance of archaea to nitrification in agricultural soils is not well understood(4). Here, we examine the contribution of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria to nitrification in six grassland soils in New Zealand using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We show that although ammonia-oxidizing archaea are present in large numbers in these soils, neither their abundance nor their activity increased with the application of an ammonia substrate, suggesting that their abundance was not related to the rate of nitrification. In contrast, the number of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria increased 3.2-10.4-fold and their activity increased 177-fold, in response to ammonia additions. Indeed, we find a significant relationship between the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and the rate of nitrification. We suggest that nitrification is driven by bacteria rather than archaea in these nitrogen-rich grassland soils.

TI  - Organization of biogeochemical nitrogen pathways with switch-like adjustment in fluctuating soil redox conditions
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB  - Nitrogen is cycled throughout ecosystems by a suite of biogeochemical processes. The high complexity of the nitrogen cycle resides in an intricate interplay between reversible biochemical pathways alternatively and specifically activated in response to diverse environmental cues. Despite aggressive research, how the fundamental nitrogen biochemical processes are assembled and maintained in fluctuating soil redox conditions remains elusive. Here, we address this question using a kinetic modelling approach coupled with dynamical systems theory and microbial genomics. We show that alternative biochemical pathways play a key role in keeping nitrogen conversion and conservation properties invariant in fluctuating environments. Our results indicate that the biochemical network holds inherent adaptive capacity to stabilize ammonium and nitrate availability, and that the bistability in the formation of ammonium is linked to the transient upregulation of the amo-hao mediated nitrification pathway. The bistability is maintained by a pair of complementary subsystems acting as either source or sink type systems in response to soil redox fluctuations. It is further shown how elevated anthropogenic pressure has the potential to break down the stability of the system, altering substantially ammonium and nitrate availability in the soil, with dramatic effects on biodiversity.

TI  - Contrasting impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 on nitrogen cycle in eutrophic water with or without Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The elevation of atmospheric CO2 is an inevitable trend that would lead to significant impact on the interrelated carbon and nitrogen cycles through microbial activities in the aquatic ecosystem. Eutrophication has become a common trophic state of inland waters throughout the world, but how the elevated CO2 affects N cycles in such eutrophic water with algal bloom, and how vegetative restoration helps to mitigate N2O emission remains unknown. We conducted the experiments to investigate the effects of ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 (a[CO2], e[CO2]; 400, 800 mu mol.mol(-1)) with and without the floating aquatic plant, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, on N-transformation in eutrophic water using the N-15 tracer method. The nitrification could be slightly inhibited by e[CO2], due mainly to the competition for dissolved inorganic carbon between algae and nitrifiers. The e[CO2] promoted denitrification and N2O emissions from eutrophic water without growth of plants, leading to aggravation of greenhouse effect and forming a vicious cycle. However, growth of the aquatic plant, Eichhornia crassipes, slightly promoted nitrification, but reduced N2O emissions from eutrophic water under e[CO2] conditions, thereby attenuating the negative effect of e[CO2] on N2O emissions. In the experiment, the N transformation was influenced by many factors such as pH, DO and algae density, except e[CO2] and plant presence. The pH could be regulated through diurnal photosynthesis and respiration of algae and mitigated the acidification of water caused by e[CO2], leading to an appropriate pH range for both nitrifying and denitrifying microbes. Algal respiration at night could consume DO and enhance abundance of denitrifying functional genes (nirK, nosZ) in water, which was also supposed to be a critical factor affecting denitrification and N2O emissions. This study clarifies how the greenhouse effect caused by e[CO2] mediates N biogeochemical cycle in the aquatic ecosystem, and how vegetative restoration mitigates greenhouse gas emission.

TI  - Arctic soil respiration and microbial community structure driven by silicon and calcium
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Global warming is most pronounced in the Arctic region. Greenhouse gas (GHG) release from Arctic soils increase due to global warming. By this, the Arctic may change from currently being a carbon sink to a future source. To improve accurate predictions of future GHG release from Arctic soils, it is important to unravel factors controlling both the microbial community structure and activity. Soil microbial activity is important for Arctic greenhouse gas production, but depends on soil conditions such as salinity being increased by calcium (Ca) and decreased by amorphous silica (Si) potentially enhancing water availability. In the Arctic, climate changes may alter salinity by changing Si and Ca concentrations upon permafrost thaw as a result of global warming with Si potentially decreasing and Ca potentially increasing salinity. Here, we show that higher Si concentration increased and higher Ca concentrations decreased the microbial CO2 production for both a salt-poor and a salt-rich soil from Greenland. In the salt-rich soil, Si amendment increased CO2 production and the abundance of gram-negative bacteria. However, the bacterial community became dominated by spore-forming gram-positive Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The CO2 release from soils was directly affected by the abundance of bacteria and fungi, and their community structure. Our results highlight the importance of the soil Si and Ca concentration on organic carbon turnover by strongly changing microbial abundance and community structure, with consequences for CO2 release in the Arctic. Consequently, Ca and Si and their relation to Arctic soil microbial community structure has to be considered when estimating pan-Arctic carbon budgets.

TI  - Nitrogen transformations associated with termite biogenic structures in a dry savanna ecosystem
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Soil structures built by litter-feeding termites are one of the main soil translocation processes in dry tropical savanna. Runways (soil sheeting) made of soil particles cemented with salivary secretions covering the dead plant pieces collected on the ground surface represent the main soil structures. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of this soil engineering activity on the microbially-mediated N transformations (nitrification and denitrification) associated with termite sheeting. We investigated the hypothesis that the physicochemical and microbial properties of termite soil sheeting depend on (i) the termite species and (ii) the type of organic substrate consumed. Soil sheeting built by two of the main savanna species, Macrotermes subhyalinus and Odontotermes nilensis, were sampled on field plots treated with three different types of litter (Acacia leaves, millet straw, both whole and ground (< 500 mum), and cattle manure). The soil's organic C, total N, inorganic N, microbial biomass, potential CO2 respiration, nitrification and denitrification were measured. For both termite species and all types of litter, the soil sheeting was enriched in organic C and inorganic N, resulting in an increase in soil respiration, whereas the microbial biomass was unchanged with respect to the reference soil. With the exception of the soil nitrification potential, the type of organic substrate did not significantly affect the properties of the soil sheeting measured. However, the nitrogen cycle was affected differently by the two termite species. In O. nilensis sheeting, the denitrification potential was reduced with respect to the reference soil, whereas the nitrification potential was inhibited in M. subhyalinus sheeting. The changes in the nitrogen cycle processes resulted in an increase in NH4+ and NO3- in the termite soil sheeting, increasing the availability of nitrogen to plants. This study reinforces the importance of termites as a keystone savanna group whose building activities have an effect on tropical soil mineralization.

TI  - Environmental risks of mask wastes binding pollutants: Phytotoxicity, microbial community, nitrogen and carbon cycles
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The increasing contamination of mask wastes presents a significant global challenge to ecological health. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the environmental risks that mask wastes pose to soil. In this study, a total of 12 mask wastes were collected from landfills. Mask wastes exhibited negligible morphological changes, and bound eight metals and four types of organic pollutants. Masks combined with pollutants inhibited the growth of alfalfa and Elymus nutans, reducing underground biomass by 84.6 %. Mask wastes decreased the Chao1 index and the relative abundances (RAs) of functional bacteria (Micrococcales, Gemmatimonadales, and Sphingomonadales). Metagenomic analysis showed that mask wastes diminished the RAs of functional genes associated with nitrification (amoABC and HAO), denitrification (nirKS and nosZ), glycolysis (gap2), and TCA cycle (aclAB and mdh), thereby inhibiting the nitrogen transformation and ATP production. Furthermore, some pathogenic viruses (Herpesviridae and Tunggulvirus) were also found on the mask wastes. Structural equation models demonstrated that mask wastes restrained soil enzyme activities, ultimately affecting nitrogen and carbon cycles. Collectively, these evidences indicate that mask wastes contribute to soil health and metabolic function disturbances. This study offers a new perspective on the potential environmental risks associated with the improper disposal of masks.

TI  - Organic material mulching regulated core microbial groups to promote soil carbon and nitrogen cycling and improve faba bean productivity under a triple-cropping system in purple soil hilly region of southwest China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Background Intensive agricultural production leads to the reduction of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) reserves, and organic material mulching (OMM) can improve microbial community structure and promote C and N accumulation. The multi-cropping system based on legumes can provide abundant organic mulching material and improve soil quality, but the mechanism by which OMM provides ecological benefits via C and N cycling in this system is still unclear.Methods In this study, a field experiment of organic mulch under the triple-cropping system of faba bean (Vicia faba L.)-corn (Zea mays L.)-sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) was performed. Four treatments were set up: without organic material mulching (CK), straw mulching (S), milk vetch (Astragalus sinicus L.) mulching (M), and straw and milk vetch mulching (SM). The dynamic changes in soil aggregates, C and N contents, enzyme activities, microbial communities and faba bean productivity under organic mulching were studied for 2 years (from October 2020 to May 2022).Results The results demonstrated that supplementation of OMM (S, M, and SM) significantly improved the stability of soil aggregates, the nutrient (C and N) contents, and the activities of acquiring enzymes compared to CK. OMM promoted the establishment of key microbial communities dominated by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Predicted functional profiles based on PICRUSt and FUNGuild analyses suggest possible upregulation of up-regulated genetic information processing, metabolism, and organismal systems functional pathways. Additionally, the enhancement of soil C and N cycling efficiency may be associated with an increase in the proportion of saprotrophs and symbiotrophs. Both the random forest model (RFM) and partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) demonstrated that OMM increased faba bean productivity by improving soil microbial diversity and the efficiency of C cycling.Conclusion This study highlighted that OMM could promote C and N cycling by regulating core microbial groups, thereby improving the faba bean productivity in dryland of purple soil hilly region of southwest China.

TI  - Biochar and Sheep Manure with Reduced Nitrogen Application Increases Rice Productivity and Mitigates N2O Emissions in Paddy Fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Background Biochar (BC) is an excellent strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the impacts of BC in combination with sheep manure (SM) and nitrogen (N) fertilizers on nitrogen cycling genes, carbon sequestration, rice productivity, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are not understood. Thus, this study was designed to determine the impacts of combined BC, SM, and N fertilizers on nitrogen cycling genes, carbon sequestration, rice productivity, and N2O emissions. Methods The study included the following treatments: T1: control, T2: 150 kg N ha(- 1) (100%), T3: biochar (33.18 t ha(- 1)), T4: sheep manure (3.75 t ha(- 1)), T5: 75 kg N ha(- 1) (50%) + biochar (50%: 16.59 t ha(- 1)), T6: 75 kg N ha(- 1) (50%) + sheep manure (50%: 1.87 t ha(- 1)); and T7: 75 kg N ha(- 1) (50%) + biochar (25%: 8.29 t ha(- 1)) + sheep manure (25%: 0.937 t ha(- 1)). Results Integrated BC, SM, and N application increased the soil pH and NH+ (4)-N content and decreased the availability of NO- (3)-N, leading to a substantial reduction in N2O emissions. Co-application of BC, SM, and N decreased the cumulative N2O emissions by 223% and 197%, respectively, during the first and second years. Integrated BC, SM, and N application also increased soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and carbon fractions (water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC)). The same treatment combination also increased the carbon liability index (CLI: 69.89 and 70.51%), carbon pool index (CPI: 95% and 114%), and carbon management index (CMI: 234.41 and 264.92%) over the control in both years. Moreover, BC, SM, and N also decreased AOA and nirK abundance and increased nosZ abundance, leading to lower N2O emissions. Additionally, the combined use of BC, SM, and N significantly increased the kernel yield (66.67 and 83.34%), biomass yield (31.77 and 51.26%), kernel weight (104 and 106%), and harvest index (19.11 and 21.29%) over the control in both years. Conclusion Therefore, BC and SM combined with reduced N application may be suitable strategies for improving rice productivity and reducing N2O emissions from paddy field. These findings also highlight the viability of combining BC and SM with reduced N application to achieve environmental sustainability while aligning with global climate resilience goals.

TI  - The type and degree of salinized soils together shape the composition of phoD-harboring bacterial communities, thereby altering the effectiveness of soil phosphorus cycling
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Limitations in soil nutrient content, particularly phosphorus (P), are key factors constraining saline soil ecosystems. Soil phosphorus-cycling functional microorganisms contribute to the conversion of insoluble phosphorus and increase available phosphorus (AP) levels in phosphorus-deficient soils. However, there is limited knowledge on how soil phoD-harboring bacterial communities regulate AP availability across varying salinization types and degrees. This work evaluated the diversity, composition, assembly, and co-occurrence network properties of phoD-harboring bacteria, and explored their relationship with AP in salinized soils of Ningxia. First, TP, APi, and Ca10P levels were high in all salinized soils, whereas bioavailable fractions (AP, MBP, Ca2P, and Ca8P) were significantly low, limiting plant phosphorus uptake. Notably, the phoD gene, which is the most abundant functional gene involved in phosphorus cycling in saline soils, exhibits a pronounced salt-stress attenuation pattern along with the Shannon and Chao1 indices of the phoD-harboring bacterial community. Consistent with this pattern, the network complexity and stability of these bacteria were overall negatively affected by saline stress pressure when compared to non-saline soils. Furthermore, as evidenced by the distribution variations among bacteria such as Bradyrhizobium, Skermanella, Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, and Mesorhizobium, the type and degree of salinization jointly shape the composition of soil phoD-harboring bacterial communities. Importantly, the composition of these bacteria communities significantly regulates alkaline phosphatase ALP activity, thereby increasing soil AP levels. Consequently, the type and degree of salinized soil can indirectly regulate AP levels by influencing the composition of the phoD-harboring bacterial community. The research findings highlight that the composition of the phoD-harboring bacteria community is critical for the regulation of phosphorus efficiency in saline-affected soils, which holds significant theoretical and practical implications for the management of phosphorus in salinized soils and sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Characterization of rhizosphere bacterial communities in oilseed rape cultivars with different susceptibility to Plasmodiophora brassicae infection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Rhizosphere microbiomes are constantly mobilized during plant-pathogen interactions, and this, in turn, affects their interactions. However, few studies have examined the activities of rhizosphere microbiomes in plants with different susceptibilities to soil-borne pathogens, especially those that cause clubroot disease. In this study, we compared the rhizosphere bacterial community in response to infection of Plasmodiophora brassicae among the four different clubroot susceptibility cultivars of oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Our results revealed obvious differences in the responses of rhizosphere bacterial community to the P. brassicae infection between the four cultivars of oilseed rape. Several bacterial genera that are associated with the nitrogen cycle, including Limnobacter, Thiobacillus, Anaeromyxobacter, Nitrosomonas, Tumebacillus, and Halomonas, showed significantly different changes between susceptible and resistant cultivars in the presence of P. brassicae infection. Moreover, increased connectedness and robustness were exhibited in the rhizosphere bacterial community co-occurrence network in clubroot-susceptible cultivars that were infected with P. brassicae, while only slight changes were observed in clubroot-resistant cultivars. Metagenomic analysis of microbial metabolism also indicated differences in the rhizosphere bacterial community between susceptible and resistant cultivars that were infected with P. brassicae. Functional analysis of the nitrogen cycle showed that genes related to nitrification (nxrB) were upregulated in susceptible cultivars, while genes related to assimilatory nitrate reduction (nasA, narB, and nirA) were upregulated in resistant cultivars that were infected with P. brassicae. These findings indicate that the synthesis and assimilation process of NO3 - content were promoted in susceptible and resistant cultivars, respectively. Our study revealed differences in the characteristics of rhizosphere bacterial communities in response to P. brassicae infection between clubroot-susceptible and clubroot-resistant cultivars as well as the potential impact of these differences on the plant-P. brassicae interaction.

TI  - Microbiome of Supraglacial Systems on the Aldegonda and Bertil Glaciers (Svalbard)
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Microbial biomass, diversity of culturable bacteria and micromycetes, and the number of functional nitrogen cycle genes in the supraglacial systems of the Aldegonda and Bertil glaciers have been studied. The biomass of microorganisms varies from 2.54 to 722 mu g/g substrate. It is shown for the first time that the major part (78.7-99.8%) of microbial biomass in supraglacial objects is represented by fungi rather than by prokaryotes, and the main part (70 to 90%) of the fungal biomass consists of mycelium with the length varying from 6.70 to 537.51 m/g substrate. The counts of prokaryotes vary from 2.4 x 10(8) to 1.95 x 10(9) cells/g substrate. The length of actinomycete mycelium falls into the range of 2.6-62.61 m/g substrate. The counts of culturable bacteria and actinomycetes vary from 3.3 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) CFU/g substrate and of micromycetes, from 2.2 x 10(1) to 1.7 x 10(4) CFU/g substrate. Bacteria of the genera Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces and micromycetes of the genera Antarctomyces, Cadophora, Hyphozyma, Teberdinia and Thelebolus are dominants. The micromycetes Antarctomyces psychrotrophicus, Hyphozyma variabilis and Teberdinia hygrophila are found in Svalbard for the first time. The copy number of amoA genes in ammonium-oxidizing bacteria varies from 5.33 x 10(6) to 4.86 x 10(9)/g substrate; of nitrogen fixation genes nifH, from 9.89 x 10(7) to 9.81 x 10(10)/g substrate; and denitrification genes nirK, from 4.82 x 10(7) to 3.34 x 10(10)/g substrate. These results indirectly suggest the leading role of fungi in the microbiome of the supraglacial objects in Svalbard and a considerable contribution of prokaryotes to the emission of greenhouse gases there.

TI  - Plant intraspecific variation modulates nutrient cycling through its below ground rhizospheric microbiome
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Plant genetic variation, through its phenotypic display, can determine the composition of below ground microbial communities. Variation within a species is increasingly acknowledged to have substantial ecological consequences, particularly through trophic cascades. We hypothesized that the intraspecific genotypic variation of the tree host might impact the phylogenetic composition of its rhizospheric microbial communities, by favouring particular clades, that might be further reflected in ecosystem process rates. We tested whether the intraspecific genotypic variation of Pinus pinaster modulates nutrient cycling by determining the phylogenetic structure of its symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi and rhizospheric bacteria. We sequenced fungal and bacterial molecular markers and reconstructed phylogenies in the rhizosphere of P. pinaster trees belonging to three genotypic variants (Mediterranean, Atlantic, African) in three 45-year-old common garden experiments, and measured seven soil enzymatic activities. Local effects, based on differences in elevation and soil conditions across sites, were strong predictors of the ectomycorrhizal and bacterial communities thriving in tree's rhizosphere. Across-site variation also explained differences in phosphorus cycling. We detected, however, a significant effect of the plant genotype on the phylogenetic structure of the root-associated microbiota that was consistent across sites. The most productive Mediterranean plant genotype sheltered the most distinct root microbiome, with the dominant Basidiomycetes and Proteobacteria having a strong influence on the phylogenetic microbial community structure and associating with an enhanced hydrolysis of celluloses, hemicelluloses and chitin. Beneath the less productive Atlantic genotype, the less abundant Ascomycetes and up to thirteen bacterial phyla shaped the phylogenetic microbial structure, and predicted the rates of peptidase. Ectomycorrhizal fungi explained the activity of cellulases and protease, and bacteria that of hemicellulases and chitinase, suggesting functional complementarity. Synthesis. This is the first report using three-replicated long-term common gardens in mature forests to disentangle plant genotype- and site-specific drivers of the rhizospheric microbiome and its enzymatic potential. We concluded that intraspecific variation in primary producers leaves a phylogenetic signature in mutualists and decomposers that further modulate key steps in carbon and nitrogen cycles. These results emphasize the ecological relevance of plant intraspecific diversity in determining essential plant-soil feedbacks that control ecosystem productivity and performance.

TI  - Responses of greenhouse gas emissions to increased precipitation events in different ecosystems: A meta-analysis
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Changes in precipitation patterns induced by climate change exacerbate the phenomenon by stimulating carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) processes in terrestrial ecosystems, leading to increased emissions of soil greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, the response of soil GHG fluxes across various global ecosystems under conditions of increased precipitation (IP) and extreme precipitation (EP) remains unclear. This study conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effects of IP and EP on soil GHG fluxes, synthesizing data from 49 published studies worldwide, and explored potential influencing factors. The results indicated that (1) IP significantly elevated CO2 emissions by 10.2 % and N2O emissions by 61.7 %, and did not impact CH4 emissions. EP treatment significantly increased N2O emissions by 61.8 %, CO2 emissions by 13.3 %, and CH4 emissions by 3.2 %. (2) Under IP treatment, significant differences in soil GHGs among various ecosystems were observed (P < 0.01). Among the three analyzed ecosystems (grassland, forest, and farmland), the response ratios of CO2 (30.4 %), N2O (61.8 %), and soil respiration (37.5 %, excluding plant respiration) were highest in the forest ecosystem and lowest in the grassland. (3) The response of CO2 flux to precipitation was most affected by soil dissolved organic C (P < 0.001) and microbial biomass C (P < 0.001). The key factor affecting the change in N2O flux was NH4+-N (P < 0.001). These findings provide a new perspective for understanding the effects of IP on soil C and N cycles in the context of global climate change.

TI  - Soil organic matter contents modulate the effects of bacterial diversity on the carbon cycling processes
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - Purpose Bacterial diversity drives multifunctionality in ecosystems, including carbon cycling, while a comprehensive understanding of how carbon contents modulate microbial function through bacterial diversity is unknown. The exact extent of the contribution of organic matters contents to carbon cyling process will be investigated using a dilution-to-extinction methods in soils. Materials and methods We conducted a dilution-to-extinction experiment to manipulate the bacterial diversity in soils amended with five different organic matter contents. Meanwhile, the abundance and community structure of bacteria were detected by quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. Furthermore, the dehydrogenase activity, cellulase enzyme activity and beta-glucosidase enzyme activity were detected. Results and discussion The co-occurrence patterns of sensitive bacterial communities in the soil with 5 organic matter contents showed that organic matter content had a strong effect on sensitive bacterial network complexity. The degree of functional redundancy varied with soil organic matter contents, which was attributed to the interactions among organisms. Conclusions Soil carbon contents exerted a strong influence on ecosystem function, and bacterial diversity plays a predominant role in soil with low organic content. Our findings showed the contribution of bacterial diversity in modulating soil function and shed new light on the role of microbial groups in land restoration.

TI  - Eutrophication: impacts of excess nutrient inputs on freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
CP  - 1st International Symposium on Issues in Environmental Pollution (IEP 98) - The State and Use of Science and Predictive Models
AB  - In the mid-1800s, the agricultural chemist Justus von Liebig demonstrated strong positive relationships between soil nutrient supplies and the growth yields of terrestrial plants, and it has since been found that freshwater and marine plants are equally responsive to nutrient inputs. Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the Earth's surface and atmosphere have increased greatly during the past two centuries. This nutrient enrichment, or eutrophication, can lead to highly undesirable changes in ecosystem structure and function, however. In this paper we briefly review the process, the impacts, and the potential management of cultural eutrophication in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems. We present two brief case studies (one freshwater and one marine) demonstrating that nutrient loading restriction is the essential cornerstone of aquatic eutrophication control. In addition, we present results of a preliminary statistical analysis that is consistent with the hypothesis that anthropogenic emissions of oxidized nitrogen could be influencing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide via nitrogen stimulation of global primary production.

TI  - Effect of mulched drip irrigation on crop biomass and carbon fluxes in maize field
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - The agroecosystem, a critical component of the terrestrial carbon cycle, plays an indispensable role in maintaining the balance of carbon pools and ensuring global food security. Investigating the interplay between crop yield and carbon cycle is essential for the advancement of sustainable agricultural practices. In the quest for water-efficient agricultural solutions, mulched drip irrigation emerges as a promising technique to mitigate water scarcity in agriculture. In the arid regions of northwest China, where water is a precious resource, understanding the impact of irrigation methods on the productivity and carbon dynamics of crops like spring maize is critical. Our study aimed to evaluate the influence of two irrigation methods-mulched drip irrigation (DI) and mulched border irrigation (BI)-on the biomass accumulation and carbon fluxes of spring maize by field observation and DNDC model simulation for comparative analysis. The findings based on field and flux observation data, underscore the transformative potential of shifting from BI to DI. DI was found to significantly enhance the soil's hydrothermal environment, which is crucial for fostering optimal conditions for crop growth. This improvement is instrumental in promoting the allocation of photosynthetic products to the aboveground biomass, ultimately leading to a substantial increase in grain yield. Our results indicated that the DI treatment not only bolstered the gross primary productivity (GPP) but also elevated the ecosystem respiration (RE) compared to the BI treatment. Finally, DI can increase the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of maize fields by 6.08 %. The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model, after calibration and validation, proved to be a reliable tool for estimating ecosystem respiration under the two irrigation systems. A thorough analysis of the simulated data revealed that DI's enhancement of the soil's hydrothermal environment also led to an increase in soil heterotrophic respiration. This insight is vital as it sheds light on the complex interactions between irrigation practices and soil microbial processes, which are integral to the carbon cycle. These findings contribute to the growing body of knowledge on sustainable agricultural practices and provide a theoretical foundation for strategies aimed at achieving carbon neutrality. By adopting data-driven approaches and leveraging advanced models, we can pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient agricultural future that harmoniously balances productivity and environmental stewardship.

TI  - Succession of the wheat seed-associated microbiome as affected by soil fertility level and introduction of Penicillium and Bacillus inoculants in the field
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - During germination, the seed releases nutrient-rich exudates into the spermosphere, thereby fostering competition between resident microorganisms. However, insight into the composition and temporal dynamics of seed-associated bacterial communities under field conditions is currently lacking. This field study determined the temporal changes from 11 to 31 days after sowing in the composition of seed-associated bacterial communities of winter wheat as affected by long-term soil fertilization history, and by introduction of the plant growth-promoting microbial inoculants Penicillium bilaiae and Bacillus simplex. The temporal dynamics were the most important factor affecting the composition of the seed-associated communities. An increase in the relative abundance of genes involved in organic nitrogen metabolism (ureC and gdhA), and in ammonium oxidation (amoA), suggested increased mineralization of plant-derived nitrogen compounds over time. Dynamics of the phosphorus cycling genes ppt, ppx and cphy indicated inorganic phosphorus and polyphosphate cycling, as well as phytate hydrolysis by the seed-associated bacteria early after germination. Later, an increase in genes for utilization of organic phosphorus sources (phoD, phoX and phnK) indicated phosphorus limitation. The results indicate that community temporal dynamics are partly driven by changed availability of major nutrients, and reveal no functional consequences of the added inoculants during seed germination.

TI  - Warming Induces High Environmental Pressure in the Lakeshore Wetland, Promoting Interactions Among Carbon-Fixing Microorganisms
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Global warming has intensified the changes in wetland carbon cycling processes, and the cbbL gene, which plays a key role in carbon fixation, is significantly affected by warming. Therefore, we set up open-top chamber warming and natural controls and used amplicon sequencing to investigate the response of the cbbL carbon-fixing microbial community in the alpine lakeshore wetland to warming. We found that after the warming treatment, the relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Chlorophyta increased, while the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria decreased (p < 0.05). Soil temperature and moisture were the most significant factors influencing the cbbL carbon-fixing microbial community in the lakeshore wetland. Deterministic processes dominated the community assembly of carbon-fixing microbes under warming conditions. Additionally, warming enhanced both cooperative and competitive interactions among carbon-sequestering microorganisms while reducing soil moisture availability and increasing environmental stress, leading to a decrease in the modularity of microbial communities. In summary, warming reduced the carbon sequestration potential of lakeside wetlands but favored the interactions among carbon-sequestering microorganisms.

TI  - Dual film-controlled model urea improves summer maize yields, N fertilizer use efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Controlled-release fertilizers are recognized for improving nitrogen efficiency, but they are significantly affected by environmental factors and often leading to suboptimal results. Nitrogen fertilizer synergists, due to their water solubility, exhibit limited persistence in the soil and cannot achieve the desired effect. Therefore, we incorporated nitrogen fertilizer synergists into the film of controlled-release fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilizer synergists were encapsulated within the film of the controlled-release fertilizer to achieved "dual film-controlled model", which improved the performance of the controlled release fertilizer. A field experiment was conducted with five treatments: no N fertilizer (N0), controlled-release fertilizer (C210), controlled-release fertilizer combined with urease inhibitor (C210N), controlled-release fertilizer combined with nitrification inhibitor (C210D), controlledrelease fertilizer combined with nitrification inhibitor and urease inhibitor (C210DN). Maize yield and economics, nitrogen use efficiency, gas emissions, global warming potential and apparent nitrogen losses were assessed. The results indicated that the application of this model regulates soil microbial community structure and functionality, thereby influencing soil nitrogen cycling processes and reduced global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). Additionally, C210DN increased NH4+-N content in the 0-20 cm soil layer at the sixth leaf stage and the tasseling stage, while significantly decreasing NO3--N content. The dual filmcontrolled model improved nitrogen use efficiency by 7.9 %-17.7 %. Overall, the dual film-controlled urea model enhanced summer maize yield and nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency while mitigating environmental pollution and emissions.

TI  - Soil multifunctionality and drought resistance are determined by plant structural traits in restoring grassland
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - It is increasingly recognized that belowground responses to vegetation change are closely linked to plant functional traits. However, our understanding is limited concerning the relative importance of different plant traits for soil functions and of the mechanisms by which traits influence soil properties in the real world. Here we test the hypothesis that taller species, or those with complex rooting structures, are associated with high rates of nutrient and carbon (C) cycling in grassland. We further hypothesized that communities dominated by species with deeper roots may be more resilient to drought. These hypotheses were tested in a 3-yr grassland restoration experiment on degraded ex-arable land in southern England. We sowed three trait-based plant functional groups, assembled using database derived values of plant traits, and their combinations into bare soil. This formed a range of plant trait syndromes onto which we superimposed a simulated drought 2yr after initial establishment. We found strong evidence that community weighted mean (CWM) of plant height is negatively associated with soil nitrogen cycling and availability and soil multifunctionality. We propose that this was due to an exploitative resource capture strategy that was inappropriate in shallow chalk soils. Further, complexity of root architecture was positively related to soil multifunctionality throughout the season, with fine fibrous roots being associated with greater rates of nutrient cycling. Drought resistance of soil functions including ecosystem respiration, mineralization, and nitrification were positively related to functional divergence of rooting depth, indicating that, in shallow chalk soils, a range of water capture strategies is necessary to maintain functions. Finally, after 3yr of the experiment, we did not detect any links between the plant traits and microbial communities, supporting the finding that traits based on plant structure and resource foraging capacity are the main variables driving soil function in the early years of grassland conversion. We suggest that screening recently restored grassland communities for potential soil multifunctionality and drought resilience may be possible based on rooting architecture and plant height. These results indicate that informed assembly of plant communities based on plant traits could aid in the restoration of functioning in degraded soil.

TI  - Distinct Drivers of Core and Accessory Components of Soil Microbial Community Functional Diversity under Environmental Changes
T2  - MSYSTEMS
AB  - It is a central ecological goal to explore the effects of global change factors on soil microbial communities. The vast functional gene repertoire of soil microbial communities is composed of both core and accessory genes, which may be governed by distinct drivers. This intuitive hypothesis, however, remains largely unexplored. We conducted a 5-year nitrogen and water addition experiment in the Eurasian steppe and quantified microbial gene diversity via shotgun metagenomics. Nitrogen addition led to an 11-fold increase in the abundance (based on quantitative PCR [qPCR]) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, which have mainly core community genes and few accessory community genes. Thus, nitrogen addition substantially increased the relative abundance of many core genes at the whole-community level. Water addition stimulated both plant diversity and microbial respiration; however, increased carbon/energy resources from plants did not counteract increased respiration, so soil carbon/energy resources became more limited. Thus, water addition selected for microorganisms with genes responsible for degrading recalcitrant soil organic matter. Accordingly, many other microorganisms without these genes (but likely with other accessory community genes due to relatively stable average microbial genome size) were selected against, leading to the decrease in the diversity of accessory community genes. In summary, nitrogen addition primarily affected core community genes through nitrogen-cycling processes, and water addition primarily regulated accessory community genes through carbon-cycling processes. Although both gene components may significantly respond as the intensity of nitrogen/water addition increases, our results demonstrated how these common global change factors distinctly impact each component.
   IMPORTANCE Our results demonstrated increased ecosystem nitrogen and water content as the primary drivers of the core and accessory components of soil microbial community functional diversity, respectively. Our findings suggested that more attention should be paid to certain components of community functional diversity under specific global change conditions. Our findings also indicated that microbial communities have adapted to nitrogen addition by strengthening the function of ammonia oxidization to deplete the excess nitrogen, thus maintaining ecosystem homeostasis. Because community gene richness is primarily determined by the presence/absence of accessory community genes, our findings further implied that strategies such as maintaining the amount of soil organic matter could be adopted to effectively improve the functional gene diversity of soil microbial communities subject to global change factors.

TI  - Responses of soil respiration to nitrogen addition are mediated by topography in a subtropical karst forest
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Soil respiration is the largest terrestrial source of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and hence plays a vital role in the carbon cycle-climate feedback. Although the effects of elevated atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition on soil respiration have been intensively investigated, it remains unclear whether the effects are mediated by topography, which impacts multiple soil abiotic and biotic properties. Here, a field N addition experiment with three rates, i.e., 0, 50 and 100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) was performed in the valley and on the slope of a subtropical karst forest in southwest China to explore whether and how topography mediates soil respiration. Nitrogen addition increased soil respiration by 55-63 % in the valley due to increased microbial activity. However, high N addition stimulated soil respiration by 56 % on the slope due to enhanced fine root biomass. The response of soil respiration to moderate N addition was significantly greater in the valley than on the slope, likely owing to the lower N availability in the valley. Our results demonstrate that the responses of soil respiration to N addition were mediated by topography, and hence highlight the importance of incorporating topography into Earth system models to better predict forest carbon dynamics in the context of elevated atmospheric N deposition.

TI  - Soil Microbe and Physicochemical Characteristics in Tensile Fracture Zone Caused by Mining Subsidence
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB  - The bacterial community plays a crucial role in the soil ecosystem, and is closely linked with soil physicochemical properties. Surface tension cracks caused by underground coal mining inevitably have a significant impact on physical properties. To reveal the characteristics of the soil bacterial communities in the surface tension zones, high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze the bacterial communities in surface tension fracture areas. Furthermore, the relationships between environmental factors and the diversity and abundance of the bacterial community, alpha diversity index, and variations in bacterial communities were discussed. We analyzed soil bacterial community structure and soil physicochemical properties from different dimensions. The results indicated that The abundance of bacteria in the soil surface layer was higher, and the nutrients in the middle and bottom of the slope increased with the increase of soil depth. Additionally, our data illustrated that microorganisms participated in soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in the soil samples. This study provides a reference for the study of variations in the bacterial diversity and community composition in surface tension fracture areas caused by underground mining.

TI  - Increased carbon sequestration of different straw return depths varies temporally
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Straw return strategies are widely used to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and alleviate climate change, depending on the involvement of microorganisms. However, the dynamic response of SOC sequestration to continuous straw return is still unclear, especially considering the complex interactions between microbial community composition, functional genes, and SOC components. A continuous field experiment was monitored in 2021-2022 to investigate the dynamics effects of straw management practices, including shallow return (SF), mulch return (MF), deep return (DF) treatments, and no straw return (CK), on microbial r and K strategies, carbon cycle genes (carbon degradation and fixation), and soil humus. The microbial r-strategists (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota) and carbon cycle genes in the subsoil exhibited differential response to the 2-years between SF and DF treatments, with DF being lower in 2021 but significantly higher in 2022 than SF. The higher carbon cycle genes in DF compared with SF, MF and CK treatments in the subsoil in 2022 were associated with the highest microbial r/K strategy ratio, which had a value of 3.9. The subsoil humic acid (HA) and humin (HU) content in 2021 were increased by 9.3 %-11.9 % and 10.4 %-22.8 % in SF compared with DF, MF and CK treatments. However, in the subsoil in 2022, SOC, HA and HU content in DF were significantly higher by 14.9 %- 24.4 %, 5.7 %-25.2 % and 15.0 %-30.5 %, compared with SF, MF and CK treatments respectively. Partial leastsquares pathway modeling also confirmed that increased HU content and carbon fixation genes abundance were the direct cause of the observed enhanced SOC. Therefore, over long-time scales, the DF method is likely the most beneficial straw management for SOC sequestration, soil nutrients and biological properties and optimally contributing to global sustainable agriculture development goals.

TI  - Changes in Microbial Activity Associated with the Nitrogen Biogeochemical Cycle in Differently Managed Soils, Including Protected Areas and Those Reclaimed with Gangue
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The proximity of ecologically valuable areas to industrial zones indicates a strong need for monitoring their condition. Soil assessment involves both molecular techniques for studying microbial biodiversity, such as PCR, sequencing, and metagenomics, as well as parameters of biochemical and enzymatic activity of soil microorganisms. The authors studied the activity of microorganisms responsible for the nitrogen cycle to compare the condition of soils under different uses (wastelands and arable fields) located in the ecologically valuable areas of the Polesie National Park (PNP, protected area) and its surroundings. Additionally, they assessed the suitability of gangue for reclamation and its effectiveness depending on treatment duration (2 and 10 years). In most of the activities analyzed, their levels were lower in the park. A higher intensity of ammonification and nitrification was observed in the soil sampled from the field in the park; however, a reduced N2O emission was also recorded after incubation in the lab of soil samples collected in the autumn, which may indicate that nitrogen loss from the soil does not occur in this particular habitat, which requires further, long-term and cyclical field trials. These observations confirm the potential protective role of the park in relation to soils and atmosphere in the context of the nitrogen cycle. The activities under study in the reclaimed soils were in both cases lower than in soils from the fields. The current results prove that this method of reclamation is not entirely effective; however, long-term reclamation yielded better results. The present study provided valuable information on the effectiveness of the protective role of the PNP in relation to soils and air. Additionally, these results may be helpful in making decisions regarding the use of waste, such as gangue, for reclamation.

TI  - Deadwood substrate and species-species interactions determine the release of volatile organic compounds by wood-decaying fungi
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Wood-decaying fungi in the phylum Basidiomycota play a significant role in the global carbon cycle, as they decompose deadwood effectively. Fungi may compete for utilizable substrate and growth space by producing soluble metabolites and by releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We determined the role of wood substrate (Scots pine or Norway spruce) on the generation of hyphal biomass, secreted metabolites and enzyme activities, wood decomposition rate, and fungal species-species interactions on VOC release. We studied one brown-rot species (Fomitopsis pinicola) and two white-rot species (Phlebia radiata and Trichaptum abietinum) cultivated individually or in combinations. Wood substrate quality influences VOC release by the wood-decaying fungi, with signature differences caused by the decomposition trait (brown rot or white rot) and species-species interactions. VOC release was higher in the cultures of Basidiomycota than in uncolonized sawdust. Fungal biomass, decomposition activity, iron reduction, enzyme activities, oxalate anion content, and oxalic acid production explained VOC release from decaying wood.

TI  - Interactions Between Bacterivorous Nematodes and Bacteria Reduce N2O Emissions
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE
AB  - Trophic interactions in micro-food webs, such as those between nematodes and their bacterial prey, affect nitrogen cycling in soils, potentially changing nitrous oxide (N2O) production and consumption. However, how nematode-mediated changes in soil bacterial community composition affect soil N2O emissions is largely unknown. Here, microcosm experiments are performed with the bacterial feeding nematode Protorhabditis to explore the potential of nematodes in regulating microbial communities and thereby soil N2O emissions. Removal of nematodes by defaunation resulted in increased N2O emissions, with the removal of Protorhabditis contributing most to this increase. Further, inoculation with Protorhabditis altered bacterial community composition and increased the relative abundance of Bacillus, and the abundance of the nosZ gene in soil. In vitro experiments indicated that Protorhabditis reinforce the reduction in N2O emissions by Bacillus due to suppressing competitors and producing bacteria growth stimulating substances such as betaine. The results indicate that interactions between nematodes and bacteria modify N2O emissions providing the perspective for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions via manipulating trophic interactions in soil.

TI  - Agricultural tillage practice and rhizosphere selection interactively drive the improvement of soybean plant biomass
T2  - PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Rhizosphere microbes play key roles in plant growth and productivity in agricultural systems. One of the critical issues is revealing the interaction of agricultural management (M) and rhizosphere selection effects (R) on soil microbial communities, root exudates and plant productivity. Through a field management experiment, we found that bacteria were more sensitive to the M x R interaction effect than fungi, and the positive effect of rhizosphere bacterial diversity on plant biomass existed in the bacterial three two-tillage system. In addition, inoculation experiments demonstrated that the nitrogen cycle-related isolate Stenotrophomonas could promote plant growth and alter the activities of extracellular enzymes N-acetyl-d-glucosaminidase and leucine aminopeptidase in rhizosphere soil. Microbe-metabolites network analysis revealed that hubnodes Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia and Pseudomonas were recruited by specific root metabolites under the M x R interaction effect, and the inoculation of 10 rhizosphere-matched isolates further proved that these microbes could promote the growth of soybean seedlings. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated that the growth-promoting mechanisms of these beneficial genera were closely related to metabolic pathways such as amino acid metabolism, melatonin biosynthesis, aerobactin biosynthesis and so on. This study provides field observation and experimental evidence to reveal the close relationship between beneficial rhizosphere microbes and plant productivity under the M x R interaction effect.

TI  - Strong nutrient limitation of rhizosphere microorganisms lowers vegetable yield sensitivity to fertilization regimes
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Rhizospheres recruit microorganisms to mediate nutrient transformation and enhance plant productivity. However, understanding is insufficient regarding the linkage between rhizosphere microbial nutrient limitation and crop yield sensitivity to fertilization regimes. Three kinds of Brassica vegetables (i.e., B. pekinensis L., B. campestris L., and B. chinensis L.) were cultivated to estimate sensitivity of vegetable yield to fertilization regimes, and molecular and statistical tools were adopted to disentangle landscape patterns of vegetable rhizosphere microorganisms. We found yields of Brassica vegetables responded largely differently to organic and inorganic fertilization treatments, and yield sensitivity to fertilization regimes was B. pekinensis L. > B. campestris L. > B. chinensis L. There were heterogeneous rhizosphere microenvironments between Brassica vegetables, showing significant differences in soil physicochemical properties, enzymatic activity, abundances of phosphorus-cycling genes, and community composition of rhizosphere bacteria and fungi. Rhizosphere microorganisms of Brassica vegetables displayed phosphorus limitation, and stronger microbial carbon and phosphorus limitations were found for rhizosphere of B. chinensis L. than rhizospheres of B. campestris L. and B. pekinensis L. Different vegetable rhizospheres displayed heterogenous landscape patterns of bacteria and fungi, showing notable differences in diversity and community structure as well as large divergence in coexistence patterns within bacteria and within fungi. Stochastic processes dominated community assemblages of rhizosphere bacteria and fungi, and rhizosphere bacteria and fungi showed opposite environmental constraint responding to vegetable yield sensitivity. Our results emphasized that a stronger nutrient limitation of rhizosphere microorganisms resulted in a more sensitive vegetable yield to fertilization regimes. Our findings enrich knowledge on nutrient limitation and diversity maintenance of microorganisms in vegetable rhizospheres, and these findings might guide precise fertilization to adjust rhizosphere microbial nutrient limitation to promote vegetable yield.

TI  - Soil physicochemical properties impact more strongly on bacteria and fungi than conversion of grassland to oil palm
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - The conversion of grassland to oil palm is expected to increase throughout tropical regions where oil palm grows. Given the extent of land use change, there are concerns associated with impacts on ecosystem function and nutrient cycling. For this work, soil samples were collected in Papua New Guinea from 15 sites with oil palm (planted on grassland) and adjacent remnant grassland. Using DNA-based approaches, bacterial and fungal community composition was assessed in each sample, along with abundance of genes involved in key nitrogen cycling steps: nitrification (bacterial and archaeal amoA genes), nitrite reduction (nirS gene), and nitrous oxide reduction (nosZ gene). Across all microbial properties measured, variation among sites was greater than variation due to land use change. This was driven by among-site variation in soil physicochemical properties, particularly total soil organic carbon content and delta C-13, electrical conductivity, exchangeable calcium, potassium and magnesium content, and extractable phosphorus content. The results suggest that in this environment, routinely measured soil properties such as soil pH, organic carbon, and exchangeable cation contents may serve as indicators for the effects of land use and management on soil microbial community composition and functioning.

TI  - Impact of intercropping grass on the soil rhizosphere microbial community and soil ecosystem function in a walnut orchard
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The intercropping of grass in orchards has beneficial effects on soil properties and soil microbial communities and is an important soil management measure for improving orchard productivity and land-use efficiency. However, few studies have explored the effects of grass intercropping on rhizosphere microorganisms in walnut orchards. In this study, we explored the microbial communities of clear tillage (CT), walnut/ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (Lp), and walnut/hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.) (Vv) intercropping system using MiSeq sequencing and metagenomic sequencing. The results revealed that the composition and structure of the soil bacterial community changed significantly with walnut/Vv intercropping compared to CT and walnut/Lp intercropping. Moreover, the walnut/hairy vetch intercropping system had the most complex connections between bacterial taxa. In addition, we found that the soil microorganisms of walnut/Vv intercropping had a higher potential for nitrogen cycling and carbohydrate metabolism, which may be related to the functions of Burkholderia, Rhodopseudomonas, Pseudomonas, Agrobacterium, Paraburkholderia, and Flavobacterium. Overall, this study provided a theoretical basis for understanding the microbial communities associated with grass intercropping in walnut orchards, providing better guidance for the management of walnut orchards.

TI  - Linking main ecological clusters of soil bacterial-fungal networks and nitrogen cycling genes to crop yields under diverse cropping systems in the North China Plain
T2  - CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - BackgroundCrop rotation changes crop species and the associated management strategies, significantly influencing soil fertility and soil microbial communities. Interactions among the species in microbial communities are important for soil nutrient cycling. Yet, the contribution of soil microbial interactions to crop yield and soil nitrogen-cycle function under wheat-maize and wheat-soybean rotation conversion remains unclear. An 8-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of simple [8-year wheat-maize rotation (8WM) and 8-year wheat-soybean rotation (8WS)] and diverse cropping systems [4-year wheat-soybean followed by 4-year wheat-maize rotation (4WS4WM) and 4-year wheat-maize followed by 4-year wheat-soybean rotation (4WM4WS)] on crop yield, soil properties, bacterial-fungal co-occurrence networks and nitrogen functional potentials. The abundances of genes with nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrification (AOB and nxrA) and denitrification (narG, nirK, norB and nosZ) potentials were quantified and bacterial and fungal communities were characterized.Results4WS4WM led to higher succeeding maize yields and lower bacterial-fungal network complexity, nitrogen fixation potentials and denitrifying potentials than 8WM. Meanwhile, 4WM4WS exhibited higher succeeding wheat and soybean yields, network complexity and lower nitrifying potentials than 8WS. The ecological cluster with the most nitrifying and denitrifying bacterial species (Module#5) and that with the least species (Module#3) dominated the potentials of nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification and succeeding maize yields in 4WS4WM and 8WM. Module#4 with the highest abundances of nitrifying bacteria (Nitrosomonadaceae) and Module#2 with the most species dominated the nitrifying potentials and succeeding wheat and soybean yields in 4WM4WS and 8WS. Soil water content, organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, NO3- and pH were key drivers influencing Module#3 and Module#5, while only NH4+ significantly affected Module#2 and Module#4.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate the importance of ecological clusters within soil microbial network in regulating crop yield and soil nitrogen cycling, and identify specific ecological clusters dominating nitrogen functional potentials in wheat-maize and wheat-soybean rotations, offering science-based recommendations for sustainable crop rotation practices.

TI  - Ecosystem type drives tea litter decomposition and associated prokaryotic microbiome communities in freshwater and coastal wetlands at a continental scale
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Wetland ecosystems are critical to the regulation of the global carbon cycle, and there is a high demand for data to improve carbon sequestration and emission models and predictions. Decomposition of plant litter is an important component of ecosystem carbon cycling, yet a lack of knowledge on decay rates in wetlands is an impediment to predicting carbon preservation. Here, we aim to fill this knowledge gap by quantifying the decomposition of standardised green and rooibos tea litter over one year within freshwater and coastal wetland soils across four climates in Australia. We also captured changes in the prokaryotic members of the tea-associated microbiome during this process. Ecosystem type drove differences in tea decay rates and prokaryotic microbiome community composition. Decomposition rates were up to 2-fold higher in mangrove and seagrass soils compared to freshwater wetlands and tidal marshes, in part due to greater leaching-related mass loss. For tidal marshes and freshwater wetlands, the warmer climates had 7-16% less mass remaining compared to temperate climates after a year of decomposition. The prokaryotic microbiome community composition was significantly different between substrate types and sampling times within and across ecosystem types. Microbial indicator analyses suggested putative metabolic pathways common across ecosystems were used to breakdown the tea litter, including increased presence of putative methylotrophs and sulphur oxidisers linked to the introduction of oxygen by root in-growth over the incubation period. Structural equation modelling analyses further highlighted the importance of incubation time on tea decomposition and prokaryotic microbiome community succession, particularly for rooibos tea that experienced a greater proportion of mass loss between three and twelve months compared to green tea. These results provide insights into ecosystem-level attributes that affect both the abiotic and biotic controls of belowground wetland carbon turnover at a continental scale, while also highlighting new decay dynamics for tea litter decomposing under longer incubations.

TI  - Study on the screening of high-efficiency salt and alkali-tolerant microbial agents and their roles and mechanisms in enhancing saline-alkaline soil remediation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Against the backdrop of limited global cultivable land reserves and rapidly increasing food demands, the improvement and utilization of saline-alkaline land carry substantial significance. Biological improvement not only enhances soil properties but also boosts biodiversity in saline-alkali ecosystems. However, the synergistic role of functional microbial agents in remediation and their impact on soil nutrient cycling mechanisms remain underexplored. In this study, a functional microbial agent Q3 was constructed by combining Bacillus oceanisediminis-Q1 and Acinetobacter indicus-Q2. Using biochar as a carrier, an efficient microbial formulation was prepared by immobilizing Q3. An in-depth study into its remediation effects on saline-alkali soil demonstrated that it significantly reduced soil salinity and alkalinity while effectively improving soil nutrient levels. Specifically, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium contents increasing by 1.18, 2.6, and 1.8 times, respectively, compared to untreated soil. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed that Q3 enhanced soil nutrient cycling, enzyme activity, and microbial abundance. Further analysis via 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the addition of the functional microbial agent led to increased expression levels of genes associated with carbon metabolism (rbcL, gltS), nitrogen cycling (nifH, amoA), and phosphorus metabolism (phoA, phoB, appA). Additionally, functional microorganisms such as Bacteroidetes, which play a critical role in carbon sequestration, and Proteobacteria, which are key drivers of the nitrification process, were significantly enriched. These microorganisms act as pivotal regulators of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus dynamics. This study demonstrated that the functional microbial agent influences the activity and community structure of indigenous microorganisms through its phosphorus-solubilizing and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. This effect is crucial for mitigating soil salinization, restoring soil nutrients, and rehabilitating saline-alkali land. The findings provide novel strategies and a robust theoretical basis for the ecological restoration of saline-alkali land and the sustainable development of agriculture.

TI  - Land-use and management practices affect soil ammonia oxidiser community structure, activity and connectedness
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Factors affecting community structure and connectivity within systems are crucial for provision of microbial ecosystem-services (e.g., soil nitrogen cycling), but what these factors are and how they are affected by land-use and management is poorly understood. Biogeochemical cycles are disrupted in agricultural-systems, providing an excellent opportunity to investigate the roles of management and land-use in shaping microbial communities and ecosystem function. We investigated soil ammonia oxidisers under different cropping practices and within a nearby grassy woodland; representing a gradient of physical/chemical disturbance. Land-use and management practices resulted in significant differences in community structure. Major differences in system connectivity were observed between land-uses, but not within management practices, indicating that land-use change is the major driver of ecosystem change, rather than management within land-uses. Agricultural ammonia oxidiser communities appeared to be less well connected and rely less on biotic interactions than those in natural systems, perhaps a reflection of the extent to which natural feedback loops are disturbed in managed systems. Smaller, but significant, differences were also evident between management treatments. Despite differences in community structure and connectivity there was, however, no significant effect on potential N-cycle rates, indicating that although land-use and management impacts may drive community changes, these do not necessarily translate into changes in functional capacity.

TI  - Mudflat reclamation causes changes of gene abundance in nitrogen cycle under long-term rice cultivation
T2  - JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Rice cultivation is the main method for mudflat reclamation. However, changes in the community structure of microbes involved in nitrogen (N) cycling in response to mudflat reclamation via rice cultivation remain poorly understood. This study used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to characterize the distribution of various inorganic N-cycling pathways in response to mudflat reclamation via rice cultivation. The results show that the abundance of functional genes followed an increasing trend, while the relative abundance showed a decreasing trend. The relative richness of functional genes in the inorganic N-cycling network showed different fluctuation trends and indicated that the nifH, archaea amoA, narG, nirS, nirK, norB, and nosZ genes greatly contribute to inorganic N-cycling. Redundancy analysis showed that soil properties, in particular, organic matter increased, while electrical conductivity decreased, driving the changes of gene distribution in the inorganic N-cycling network over the course of reclamation. Mudflat reclamation under long-term rice cultivation promoted the reproduction of microbes related to the N cycle, and also changed the distribution of functional genes that are involved in the inorganic N cycle due to changes of soil properties.

TI  - Live long and prosper: plant-soil feedback, lifespan, and landscape abundance covary
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Plant soil feedbacks (PSFs) are thought to be important to plant growth and species coexistence, but most support for these hypotheses is derived from short-term greenhouse experiments. Here we use a seven-year, common garden experiment to measure PSFs for seven native and six nonnative species common to the western United States. We use these long-term, field-based estimates to test correlations between PSF and plant landscape abundance, species origin, functional type, and lifespan. To assess potential PSF mechanisms, we also measured soil microbial community composition, root biomass, nitrogen cycling, bulk density, penetration resistance, and shear strength. Plant abundance on the landscape and plant lifespan were positively correlated with PSFs, though this effect was due to the relationships for native plants. PSFs were correlated with indices of soil microbial community composition. Soil nutrient and physical traits and root biomass differed among species but were not correlated with PSF. While results must be taken with caution because only 13 species were examined, these species represent most of the dominant plant species in the system. Results suggest that native plant abundance is associated with the ability of long-lived plants to create positive plant-soil microbe interactions, while short-lived nonnative plants maintain dominance by avoiding soil-borne antagonists, increasing nitrogen cycling and dedicating resources to aboveground growth and reproduction rather than to belowground growth. Broadly, results suggest that PSFs are correlated with a suite of traits that determine plant abundance.

TI  - Soil Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus Cycling Microbial Populations and Their Resistance to Global Change Depend on Soil C:N:P Stoichiometry
T2  - MSYSTEMS
AB  - Maintaining stability of ecosystem functions in the face of global change calls for a better understanding regulatory factors of functionally specialized microbial groups and their population response to disturbance. In this study, we explored this issue by collecting soils from 54 managed ecosystems in China and conducting a microcosm experiment to link disturbance, elemental stoichiometry, and genetic resistance. Soil carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry imparted a greater effect on the abundance of microbial groups associated with main C, N, and P biogeochemical processes in comparison with mean annual temperature and precipitation. Nitrogen cycling genes, including bacterial amoA-b, nirS, narG, and norB, exhibited the highest genetic resistance to N deposition. The amoA-a and nosZ genes exhibited the highest resistance to warming and drying-wetting cycles, respectively. Soil total C, N, and P contents and their ratios had a strong direct effect on the genetic resistance of microbial groups, which was dependent on mean annual temperature and precipitation. Specifically, soil C/P ratio was the main predictor of N cycling genetic resistance to N deposition. Soil total C and N contents and their ratios were the main predictors of P cycling genetic resistance to N deposition, warming, and drying-wetting. Overall, our work highlights the importance of soil stoichiometric balance for maintaining the ability of ecosystem functions to withstand global change.
   IMPORTANCE To be effective in predicting future stability of soil functions in the context of various external disturbances, it is necessary to follow the effects of global change on functionally specialized microbes related to C and nutrient cycling. Our study represents an exploratory effort to couple the stoichiometric drivers to microbial populations related with main C, N, and P cycling and their resistances to global change. The abundance of microbial groups involved in cellulose, starch, and xylan degradation, nitrification, N fixation, denitrification, organic P mineralization, and inorganic P dissolution showed a high stoichiometry dependency. Resistance of these microbial populations to global change could be predicted by soil C:N:P stoichiometry. Our work highlights that stoichiometric balance in soil C and nutrients is instrumental in maintaining the stability and adaptability of ecosystem functions under global change.

TI  - Microbial community of nitrogen cycle-related genes in aquatic plant rhizospheres of Lake Liangzi in winter
T2  - JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - This study investigated the community structure of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria /archaea (AOB and AOA), as well as the effects of four aquatic plants (namely Ceratophyllum demersum, Hydrilla verticillata, Potamogeton crispus, and Nymphaea tetragona) rhizospheres on the abundance of AOB amoA, AOA amoA, anammox 16S rRNA, nirK, and nirS in Lake Liangzi, China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most AOB groups were Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas, in which Nitrosospira was dominant. The AOA amoA were affiliated with two branches of classical sequences which belonging to Thaumarchaeota: water/sediments branch and soil/sediments branch. The abundance of AOA amoA in the rhizospheres of aquatic plants were higher than in the non-rhizosphere (p < 0.05), indicating that aquatic plants may promote the growth of AOA. However, the anammox 16S rRNA showed the opposite trend relative to AOA amoA (p < 0.05). Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the differences in abundance of AOB, AOA, anammox bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria are very likely related to the different contents of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) and thus to the rhizosphere states of aquatic plants.

TI  - The contribution of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to ecosystem respiration and methane flux in an ephemeral plants-dominated desert
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can significantly influence the soil carbon cycle, however, their impacts on desert soils are still unclear. Here, a field control experiment, using in-growth mesocosms, was conducted to quantitatively assess the contribution of AMF and ephemeral plants to ecosystem respiration (R-e) and methane (CH4) flux in the Gurbantunggut Desert in China, from April to May 2017. Ephemeral plant biomass was significantly increased by AMF infection. R-e was significantly positively correlated with AMF infection rate, whereas CH4 flux was significantly negatively correlated. The contribution of AMF to R-e was up to 24%, comparable to the contribution of non-AMF microbial respiration, which accounted for up to 36%, whereas the respiration of ephemeral plants accounted for 40%. Variation in R-e was most strongly associated with soil organic carbon and soil available potassium concentrations and soil temperature. Non-AMF microorganisms accounted for most of the CH4 flux (up to 85%). In contrast, AMF only accounted for 15% of total CH4 flux. The CH4 flux was significantly influenced by soil NO3--N content, soil moisture, soil temperature and soil NH4+-N content. Overall, AMF significantly influenced R-e and CH4 flux, and also enhanced the growth of ephemeral plants, which have an important role in the carbon cycle in desert ecosystems.

TI  - Disturbances of electron production, transport and utilization caused by chlorothalonil are responsible for the deterioration of soil denitrification
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Extensive use of pesticides poses significant threats to soil denitrification process and might affect the emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) from soils. Previous studies on soil denitrification have frequently focused on natural factors or nitrogen fertilization, but have ignored the role of pesticides. In this study, the effects of chlorothalonil (CHT, a common pesticide) and its major metabolite 4-hydroxychlorothalonil (4OH-CHT) on soil denitrification were explored. Results showed that soil denitrification rates (N-15 pairing method) were declined by 27.4%-72.2%, whereas N2O emissions were unexpectedly increased by 83.9%-299.5%. These disturbances were caused by CHT, rather than by its metabolite 40H-CHT, and noncompetitive inhibition was observed with an inhibition constant of 9.74 mg kg(-1). Mechanistic studies further revealed that CHT inhibited soil denitrification process by deteriorating organic matter metabolism (electron production), electron respiration chain (electron transport), and denitrifying enzymes activities (electron utilization), more than by influencing denitrifier communities and denitrifying gene abundances. Furthermore, structural equation modeling suggested that electron respiration chain and N2O reductase activities were the most important drivers in explaining denitrification in CHT-polluted soils. Our results imply that the wide use of pesticides in agricultural production may disturb soil nitrogen cycle and increase the production of potent greenhouse gas N2O.

TI  - Straw application and drip irrigation boost wolfberry performance in coastal saline soil by modifying the root zone environment and rhizosphere microbiome
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsStraw application and drip irrigation are effective practices for amelioration of saline soils, but their coupling effects on plant-soil-microbial interactions in coastal farmland remain understudied. Here, we analyzed changes in the root zone environment of wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L.) grown in a saline farmland soil with straw application and drip irrigation to unravel their role in regulating crop yield and quality performance.MethodsA soil box experiment was conducted for 120 days, with wheat straw buried at the 30 cm soil depth and drip irrigation applied at three different levels (800, 1600, and 2400 m3<middle dot>hm-2).ResultsStraw application alleviated water and salt stresses in the plant root zone. In addition to increasing fungal diversity (Chao 1), straw application altered the composition and function of rhizosphere microbial communities. This was indicated by the enrichment of actinobacteria, plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial genera (Sphingomonas, TM7a, Pseudoxanthomonas, Devosia), carbon- and nitrogen-cycling bacterial groups (related to chemoheterotrophy, chitinolysis, ureolysis, nitrogen fixation), and mycorrhizal fungi (endomycorrhizae, ectomycorrhizae), with suppression of pathogens. Both new shoot length and fruit yield notably increased under medium and high irrigation levels. In particular, medium irrigation resulted in the highest proportions of mycorrhizal fungi and carbon- and nitrogen-cycling bacteria, enhancing nutrient accumulation in soils (nitrogen, phosphorus) and fruits (polysaccharides, betaines, carotenoids).ConclusionsStraw application with a medium level of drip irrigation is the optimal regime for saline soil amelioration in coastal farmland, taking into account plant-soil-microbial feedbacks and water resource input.

TI  - Can soil piping impact environment and society? Identifying new research gaps
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
AB  - Soil piping is a widespread, although often overlooked land degradation process. So far, subsurface soil erosion studies have been focused on the importance of soil piping in hydrological and geomorphological processes, and factors controlling piping processes. Nowadays, the environmental changes being caused by the Anthropocene have clearly demonstrated that society depends on soil more than ever before, so the traditional studies of soil erosion processes need to be redefined. In that sense, geomorphologists face to overcome new piping-related problems. In this article we identify new possible areas of research: (i) soil pipes and pipe collapses (PCs) as natural hazards, (ii) role of soil piping in carbon cycle, (iii) soil pipes and PCs and their relationships with biodiversity, and (iv) piping-affected areas as geodiversity sites. Only better recognition of natural hazards driven by soil piping, such as land subsidence and degradation, landslides, flooding and off-site sediment effects may result in better prevention and control measures in piping-affected areas. Moreover, in the context of Global Change the role of soil piping in carbon cycle should be raised. Land-use and land-cover changes, as well as climate change may affect piping dynamics in different morphoclimatic regions and soil loss due to piping may lead to carbon loss. Soil pipes and PCs are closely interlinked with biodiversity, both positively and negatively. Piping erosion may directly and indirectly destroy vegetation and animals, although in some cases piping erosion may create new habitats and provide favourable conditions for some species. However, soil piping is not only an environmental and societal problem, but it may also contribute to the world geodiversity, which is clearly observed in badland sites. Piping erosion may have a significant impact on environment and society, thus further research with new questions is essential to provide knowledge for sustainable development.

TI  - Changes in soil moisture and its relationships with nitrogen cycle processes in a northern hardwood forest
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Identifying which aspects of global environmental change are driving observed ecosystem process responses is a great challenge. Here, we address how long-term (10-25 years) alterations in soil moisture, and nitrogen (N) oligotrophication (i.e., decreases in soil N availability relative to plant demand), alter the production of plant-available N via net mineralization and nitrification in a northern hardwood forest. Our objectives were to determine whether soil moisture has changed over the past decade and whether N cycle processes have become less sensitive to soil moisture over time due to N oligotrophication. We used long-term datasets from several related studies to show (i) increasing winter soil temperatures and declining summer soil moisture from late 2010 into 2024, (ii) reductions in sensitivity of N cycling rates to soil moisture, and (iii) declining moisture-adjusted N cycle processes (the ratio of rate of N process:soil moisture) over time in both summer and winter. These changes suggest continued reductions in N availability to plants in these forests, with potential effects on forest productivity and response to disturbance.

TI  - Biochar improved soil health and mitigated greenhouse gas emission from controlled irrigation paddy field: Insights into microbial diversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Biochar application (BA) and controlled irrigation (CI) can realize the resource utilization of biowaste and water respectively. Both BA and CI can affect soil carbon pool dynamics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in paddy fields, but their synergistic effects and the microbial mechanism remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of BA on CO2 exchange, GHG emissions, and soil microbial diversity of paddy fields under CI. BA increased soil respiration rate (Rs) from CI paddy fields by 23.81%-41.45 %, possibly due to the increase of Curvibacter, while BA reduced global warming potential by 25.85%-37.84 %. The reduction of N2O emission under CI with BA may be attributed to the increase of Proteobacteria and the decrease of Nitrospira. CI decreased the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and soil organic carbon but increased Rs and dissolved organic carbon, compared with flood irrigation. Lactobacillus and Mortierella were dominant bacteria and fungi at milk stage. In addition, BA and CI mitigated CH4 emissions and reduced the abundance of Russula. Both bacteria and fungi play important roles in soil carbon cycle, which is mainly affected by soil temperature, humidity, and ammonium. These results indicate that BA combined with CI is a promising cleaner production strategy to simultaneously improve soil health, mitigate GHG emission, and mediate soil microbial community structure.

TI  - Spatial soil heterogeneity rather than the invasion of Spartina alterniflora drives soil bacterial community assembly in an Eastern Chinese intertidal zone an coastline
T2  - CATENA
AB  - The invasion of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) significantly influences the stability and transformation of soil organic carbon in coastal ecosystems. However, the impact of this invasion on the assembly of soil bacterial communities along estuary coastlines and soil profiles remains unclear. This study involved collecting soil samples from different environments (areas covered with S. alterniflora vs. barren flats) along the coastline of an estuary. The samples were taken at different depths (0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, 40-60 cm, 60-80 cm, 80-100 cm) within a 1-meter soil profile in the intertidal area of Xiaoyangkou Estuary in Jiangsu, China. The invasion of S. alterniflora had a notable impact on soil SOM (soil organic matter), DOC (dissolved organic carbon), POC (particulate organic carbon), and MAOC (mineral-associated organic carbon). Concurrently, the soil layer primarily influenced the levels of soil DOC and MAOC. The dominant bacterial communities inside the soil consisted of Proteobacteria (27.4-50.2 %), Bacteroidota (5.2-23.3 %), and Desulfobacterota (9.5-19.8 %), which participates in several elemental cycles, such as the carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus cycles. The changes in the patterns and functions of bacterial communities related to carbon cycling were mostly associated with the estuary shoreline, rather than being influenced by the invasion of S. alterniflora or variations in soil depths. Soil total carbon (TC) and SOM displayed a greater influence than other soil organic fractions on the distribution of the bacterial community. Furthermore, elements such as As, Cr, and Zn also exerted a significant impact on the assembly of soil bacterial communities. Our research findings suggest that the influence of S. alterniflora invasion on the composition and functioning of soil bacterial communities is contingent upon the specific features of the area. These characteristics, in turn, control the stability of soil carbon and the transformation of various types of soil carbon.

TI  - Dynamics of bacterial growth, and life-history tradeoffs, explain differences in soil carbon cycling due to land-use
T2  - ISME COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Soil contains a considerable fraction of Earth's organic carbon. Bacterial growth and mortality drive the microbial carbon pump, influencing carbon use efficiency and necromass production, key determinants for organic carbon persistence in soils. However, bacterial growth dynamics in soil are poorly characterized. We used an internal standard approach to normalize 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing data allowing us to quantify growth dynamics for 30 days following plant litter input to soil. We show that clustering taxa into three groups optimized variation of bacterial growth parameters in situ. These three clusters differed significantly with respect to their lag time, growth rate, growth duration, and change in abundance due to growth (Delta Ng) and mortality (Delta Nd), matching predictions of Grime's CSR life-history framework. In addition, we show a striking relationship between Delta Ng and Delta Nd, which reveals that growth in soil is tightly coupled to death. This result suggests a fitness paradox whereby some bacteria can optimize fitness in soil by minimizing mortality rather than maximizing growth. We hypothesized that land-use constrains microbial growth dynamics by favoring different life-history strategies and that these constraints control carbon mineralization. We show that life-history groups vary in prevalence with respect to land-use, and that bacterial growth dynamics correlated with carbon mineralization rate and net growth efficiency. Meadow soil supported more bacterial growth, greater mortality, and higher growth efficiency than agricultural soils, pointing toward more efficient conversion of plant litter into microbial necromass, which should promote long-term C stabilization.

TI  - ASSESSING BRAZIL CARBON BUDGET .2. BIOTIC FLUXES AND NET CARBON BALANCE
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The global carbon cycle is affected by the annual addition of 7.0 x 10(9) Mg CO2-C to the atmosphere from deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. Because of its large area of high C density forests and high deforestation rate, Brazil may play an important role in the global C cycle. The study reported here developed an annual C budget for Brazil for the year 1990. The budget was based on a simple conceptual model of ecosystem C storage and flux, a newly developed vegetation map based on remote sensing data, and published information on carbon densities and flux parameters. The analysis presents an estimate of net anthropogenic flux from land use change and includes an estimate of C accumulation in secondary forests. Net CO2-C emission estimates ranged from 174 X 10(6) to 233 X 10(6) Mg C year(-1). Timber harvest in plantations and burning fossil fuels contributed additional emissions of about 107 X 10(6) Mg C year(-1). Brazil's combined net C emissions represented 4-5% of the global total.

TI  - The Process of Soil Carbon Sequestration in Different Ecological Zones of Qingtu Lake in the Arid-Semi-Arid Region of Western China
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - As a vital component of the global carbon pool, soils in arid and semi-arid regions play a significant role in carbon sequestration. In the context of global warming, increasing temperatures and moisture levels promote the transformation of barren land into wetlands, enhancing carbon sinks. However, the overdevelopment of oases and excessive extraction of groundwater lead to the opposite effect, reducing carbon sequestration. This study examines two soil types-meadow soil (MS) and swamp soil (SS)-from Qingtu Lake, an arid lake in western China. It analyzes the sources of soil inorganic carbon, the composition and origin of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and the relationships between microbes, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC), mineral composition, and soil texture. The results indicate that inorganic carbon in the study area consists of both primary carbonate minerals and secondary pedogenic carbonates. The DOM primarily consists of two components, both identified as terrestrial humic substances. In meadow soils, bacterial activity drives the weathering of plagioclase, which releases Ca2+ necessary for the formation of pedogenic carbonates. Plagioclase also provides colonization sites for microbes and, along with microbial activity, participates in the soil carbon cycle. Within the soil community, bacteria appear to play a more critical role than fungi. In contrast, microbial contributions to the carbon cycle in swamp soils are weaker, with minerals predominantly interacting with organic carbon to form mineral-associated organic matter, thus promoting the soil carbon cycle. These findings have important implications for understanding soil carbon sinks under different micro-ecological conditions in arid and semi-arid regions. Through targeted human intervention, it is possible to enhance carbon sequestration in these areas, contributing to the mitigation of global climate change.

TI  - Organic management improved the multifunctionality in recolonization soil by increasing microbial diversity and function
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Organic management enhances the formation of distinct and stable soil microbial communities, however, its influence on the temporal recovery of microbiome and multifunctionality of sterilized soil remains poorly understood. We used amplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing to investigate the effects of microbial communities in long-term organic and conventional managed soils on restoring soil microbiome and functionality. We calculated multifunctionality of soils at days 30 and 90 of recolonization using the averaging approach. Results showed that organic management (O) significantly increased alpha diversity, niche width and network complexity of microbial community compared to conventional management (C). The alpha diversity, niche width and network complexity of microbial community in soils with organic soil suspension were significantly increased compared to conventional management at days 30 and 90 of recolonization. Soil multifunctionality of sterilized organic managed soil inoculated with organic soil suspension (OO) was 14.6% to 70.6% higher than that of the rest treatments. Macrogenomic analysis revealed that O significantly enriched functional pathways of ABC transporters, carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, two-component and nitrogen metabolism as well as most of the functional genes for carbon degradation, carbon fixation, nitrogen cycling and phosphorus cycles compared to C. These functional pathways and genes were also significantly enriched in soils with organic soil suspension at day 30 and 90 of recolonization. Furthermore, alpha diversity, niche width, network complexity, functional pathways and functional genes of microbiome correlated positively with soil multifunctionality. Synthesis and applications. Our results emphasize the importance of organic management induced changes in diversity, network complexity, and functionality of microbial communities for promoting recovery to soil microbial and functional losses, providing the theoretical basis for sustainable impact of organic management in agronomic production on soil microbiome and function.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

TI  - Regulation of carbon and nitrogen exchange rates in biological soil crusts by intrinsic and land use factors in the Sahel area
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The occurrence and diversity of biological soil crusts (BSC) a thin soil surface layer composed of phototrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms intimately associated with soil particles, are known as strong indicators of ecosystem health and sensitivity to soil surface disturbances and are key factors in the biochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen in drylands. However, the impact of land use on C and N budgets related to BSC dynamics is poorly understood and hinders the prediction of changes in soil fertility in response to future land use scenarios. In this study, we examined the C and N exchange rates of BSC sampled along a north-south pluviometric gradient of the Sub-Sahel, which provides evidence of increasing human land pressure, leading to a gradient in fallow duration and trampling intensity. We demonstrate that the net and gross photosynthesis by BSC significantly increases with fallow duration and a reduction of trampling intensity, thus affecting BSC fine particles and relative water content. Conversely, no effect of land use was found on N fixation or mineralisation rates, which are instead regulated by the N availability within the crust. Simple statistical models were derived from the relationships between C exchange rates and BSC intrinsic characteristics related to soil surface disturbances. The proposed statistical models were tested for C gas exchange with independent data obtained from a new BSC dataset sampled in Burkina Faso and Niger. A simple equation using BSC fine particle content as a unique variable was found to explain between 60 and 70% of the gross photosynthesis. Our findings will help in mapping photosynthesis and estimating the contribution of BSC to the carbon budget at a regional scale in the dryland area of the Sahel and to further testing of land use change scenarios.

TI  - Snow depths' impact on soil microbial activities and carbon dioxide fluxes from a temperate wetland in Northeast China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Snow depth may have a complex influence on carbon cycling in winter. Here we set up a field experiment to investigate how different snow depths (0 cm, 60 cm, 90 cm) influenced carbon dioxide (CO2) in a wetland. The mean +/- standard error of CO2 emissions under snow addition treatments (60 cm and 90 cm snow depths) were 0.92 +/- 0.16 g.cm(-2).s(-1) and 0.53 +/- 0.16 g.cm(-2).s(-1), respectively, compared with snow removal treatment (0 cm snow depth), 0.11 +/- 0.05 g.cm(-2).s(-1). In general, snow addition increased CO2 fluxes significantly. As snow depths increased, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and bacterial diversities increased drastically. More important, the community of bacteria differed under different treatments. Firmicutes, which can resist dehydration and extremely low temperatures, was widely distributed in the snow removal treatment, where it sustained soil biochemical processes. Overall, our study indicates that snow cover counteracts the negative effects on soil microbial activities caused by low temperatures and could play a critical role in winter carbon cycling in wetlands.

TI  - Feed in summer, rest in winter: microbial carbon utilization in forest topsoil
T2  - MICROBIOME
AB  - Background: Evergreen coniferous forests contain high stocks of organic matter. Significant carbon transformations occur in litter and soil of these ecosystems, making them important for the global carbon cycle. Due to seasonal allocation of photosynthates to roots, carbon availability changes seasonally in the topsoil. The aim of this paper was to describe the seasonal differences in C source utilization and the involvement of various members of soil microbiome in this process.
   Results: Here, we show that microorganisms in topsoil encode a diverse set of carbohydrate-active enzymes, including glycoside hydrolases and auxiliary enzymes. While the transcription of genes encoding enzymes degrading reserve compounds, such as starch or trehalose, was high in soil in winter, summer was characterized by high transcription of ligninolytic and cellulolytic enzymes produced mainly by fungi. Fungi strongly dominated the transcription in litter and an equal contribution of bacteria and fungi was found in soil. The turnover of fungal biomass appeared to be faster in summer than in winter, due to high activity of enzymes targeting its degradation, indicating fast growth in both litter and soil. In each enzyme family, hundreds to thousands of genes were typically transcribed simultaneously.
   Conclusions: Seasonal differences in the transcription of glycoside hydrolases and auxiliary enzyme genes are more pronounced in soil than in litter. Our results suggest that mainly fungi are involved in decomposition of recalcitrant biopolymers in summer, while bacteria replace them in this role in winter. Transcripts of genes encoding enzymes targeting plant biomass biopolymers, reserve compounds and fungal cell walls were especially abundant in the coniferous forest topsoil.

TI  - Metabolism characteristics of nitrogen functional microorganisms in bioretention system under multiple dry-wet alternation
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB  - In this study, we used metagenomic sequencing to explore the metabolism characteristics of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms in a bioretention system under multiple dry-wet alternation conditions. The results revealed that different dry-wet alternation conditions affected the composition of nitrogen-cycling microbes in bio-retention soil media (BSM). In addition, the metagenomic analyses showed a higher relative abundance of key denitrifiers (Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria) under constant periods than unordered period. Furthermore, there was increased expression of nitrification functional genes and decreased expression of denitrifying func-tional genes during the unordered period, leading to nitrate accumulation in BSM. Under the constant dry-wet conditions, a short dry period (5 d) was shown to be beneficial to the nitrate reduction process. However, there was a risk of nitrite accumulation, which could be improved by rewetting. Moreover, our data proved that the NADH production process was inhibited in unordered period, causing nitrate accumulating. In conclusion, this study revealed that the different dry-wet alternation conditions could drive the expression of nitrogen functional genes, thus affected the biological nitrogen metabolism in bioretention systems.

TI  - RESPONSE OF SOIL ENZYMES TO VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS EMITTED FROM CREOSOTE-TREATED WOOD
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB  - This paper presents the comparison of changes in the enzyme activities involved in carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen cycle in soil exposed to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from creosote treated wood. The laboratory experiment was carried out on two soil samples: loamy sand (C-org 8.71 g kg(-1) pH(Kcl) 6.36) and sandy loam (C-org 10.92 g kg(-1), pH(KCl) 6.81). The soil samples were incubated with ground sleepers impregnated with creosote. After 21 days of incubation, in the soil samples the activities of dehydrogenases, catalase, beta-glucosidase, o-diphenol oxidase, lipase, acid phosphomonoesterase, alkaline phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, phosphotriesterase, inorganic pyrophosphatase, urease, nitrate reductase, and proteases were determined. VOCs emitted from the creosote-treated wood significantly changed activities most of the soil enzymes. Increase in activity was found for dehydrogenases (in both soil types) and lipase (in loamy sand). The highest inhibition was observed for inorganic pyrophosphatase, nitrate reductase, and proteases. Calculated values of resistance index showed that among the measured enzymes involved in carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen cycle, dehydrogenases, inorganic pyrophosphatase, and proteases were the most sensitive to VOCs, respectively.

TI  - Invasions eliminate the legacy effects of substrate history on microbial nitrogen cycling
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Changes in substrate quality driven by climate, land use, or other forms of global change may represent a strong selective force on microbial communities. Invasion of new taxa into a community through dispersal, evolution, or recolonization could impact the outcome of this environmental selection. Here, we simulated substrate change with a trait-based model of microbial litter decomposition (DEMENTpy) to assess the legacy effects of past substrate quality and the impact of selection by a new substrate on community decomposition activity. Simulations were run with different levels of invasion, including invasion from communities long-adapted to the new substrate. Legacy effects were evident with substrate change for native communities differing in composition. Protein was the only substrate that exerted a strong enough selective force to affect community composition. Legacy effects disappeared when invaders came from substrates similar to the new substrate. Together, our simulations demonstrate that substrate quality changes associated with global change can lead to legacy effects on substrate degradation. In decomposing plant litter, such legacy effects can occur if substrate inputs shift to higher protein content and if invasion is low.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi regulate soil respiration and its response to precipitation change in a semiarid steppe
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are critical links in plant-soil continuum and play a critical role in soil carbon cycles. Soil respiration, one of the largest carbon fluxes in global carbon cycle, is sensitive to precipitation change in semiarid ecosystems. In this study, a field experiment with fungicide application and water addition was conducted during 2010-2013 in a semiarid steppe in Inner Mongolia, China, and soil respiration was continuously measured to investigate the influences of AMF on soil respiration under different precipitation regimes. Results showed that soil respiration was promoted by water addition treatment especially during drought seasons, which induced a nonlinear response of soil respiration to precipitation change. Fungicide application suppressed AMF root colonization without impacts on soil microbes. AMF suppression treatment accelerated soil respiration with 2.7, 28.5 and 37.6 g Cm-2 across three seasons, which were mainly caused by the enhanced heterotrophic component. A steeper response of soil respiration rate to precipitation was found under fungicide application treatments, suggesting a greater dampening effect of AMF on soil carbon release as water availability increased. Our study highlighted the importance of AMF on soil carbon stabilization and sequestration in semiarid steppe ecosystems especially during wet seasons.

TI  - Effect of temperature on below-ground N-dynamics in a weedy model ecosystem at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 levels
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Model multispecies terrestrial communities composed of four trophic levels (plants, herbivores, parasitoids, decomposers) were established in the Ecotron controlled environment facility. Two experimental runs enabled us to investigate the effects of enhanced temperature on below-ground microbial processes (N-mineralisation. urease, arginine deaminase, protease activity and potential denitrification) in both ambient and elevated (ambient +200 ppm) CO2 atmospheres.
   The enzyme activities involved in nitrogen cycling showed weak responses to elevated temperature in both experimental runs. In the Ambient CO2 Run, protease and arginine deaminase values tended to be lower in elevated temperature; on the other hand, N-mineralisation, urease and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) were higher. In the Elevated CO2 Run, all microbial variables showed higher activities at elevated temperature, although only the results for DEA and arginine deaminase were statistically significant. The interaction between higher temperature and elevated CO2 weakly affected root growth and tissue C:N ratio, limiting feedbacks into the microbial community.
   Besides temperature and CO2, substrate availability, water stress and successional development regulated the response of the soil microbes. The supply of organic carbon and nitrogen in the soil allowed plant growth and maintenance of the microbial population. Nitrogen competition between vegetation and microbes restricted net microbial growth. The increase of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at higher CO2, and temperature levels significantly favoured DEA. The high water regime in the soil also favoured DEA and inhibited oxidation of organic compounds. as indicated by low levels of enzyme activity. Additionally, water stress decreased rooting density in the soil; this resulted in negative feedback into microbial processes. We conclude that water stress and soil nitrogen deficiency caused an early levelling-off of both microbial population growth and activity rates during the early part of the model ecosystem's development.

TI  - Ecological Shifts and Functional Adaptations of Soil Microbial Communities Under Petroleum Hydrocarbon Contamination
T2  - WATER
AB  - Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination has emerged as a significant global environmental issue, severely impacting soil microbial communities and their functions. This study employed high-throughput sequencing to systematically analyze the bacterial community structure and functional genes in soils with varying levels of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination. The results demonstrated that petroleum contamination led to a significant decline in microbial diversity, while enhancing the abundance of specific functional genes, such as those involved in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation, methane production, and denitrification. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed that microbial communities in highly contaminated soils tended to form highly clustered and specialized groups, while simultaneously promoting the coexistence of phylogenetically distant microorganisms. The Mantel test identified significant correlations between ammonium ion concentration, soil moisture content, and microbial metabolic pathways, particularly those related to petroleum hydrocarbon degradation and denitrification. These findings suggest that petroleum contamination not only disrupts the carbon and nitrogen metabolism balance but also has profound implications for greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen cycling, potentially destabilizing the ecosystem. This study provides novel insights into the ecological functions of microbial communities in petroleum-contaminated soils and highlights potential key factors for pollution management and ecological restoration.

TI  - Soil Health, Crop Yield and Carbon Footprint Trade-Offs Between Conservation and Conventional Farming: A Case Study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Transitioning towards soil health-oriented farming systems is fundamental to mitigate future challenges such as climate change, soil degradation, and increasing global food demands. In this study, we evaluated soil health, crop yields, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at a long-term experimental site in Central Europe that comprised two cropping systems: a conventional system with regular tillage, low-diversity crop rotation, and minimal cover cropping, and a conservation system with shallow tillage, diverse crop rotation, and extensive cover cropping. We assessed soil health using 13 physico-chemical and biological parameters, calculated field-scale GHG emissions, and analysed yield dynamics over an eight-year period to evaluate potential crop yield penalties under conservation farming. We observed significant soil health advances (+7%) and reductions in GHG emissions (-43%) with conservation farming, while crop yields for all cultivated crops remained stable. Improvements in soil health were particularly pronounced for nitrogen cycling and microbial-driven processes. For several measured soil health parameters, we found a larger effect of crop species compared to farming system. Further, positive management effects on soil were apparent particularly for winter wheat and to a lesser extent for maize and sugar beet, strongly emphasizing the need for standardized soil health assessments that take crop species into account. Our study demonstrates that easily implementable conservation farming measures such as reduced tillage, increased crop diversity, and enhanced cover cropping can substantially improve soil health and long-term agricultural sustainability without compromising crop yields. Conservation farming thus emerges as a viable strategy to support resilient crop production in temperate regions.

TI  - Long-Term Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition Enhances Forest Production by Suppressing Microbial Competition for Phosphorus
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Ecological stoichiometry theory predicts that prolonged nitrogen (N) deposition exacerbates phosphorus (P) limitation in terrestrial primary production. However, this hypothesis remains untested using canopy N addition (CN) experiments that consider critical canopy processes. In a 10-year CN and understory N addition (UN) experiment in P limited subtropical forests, CN unexpectedly increased plant biomass and P uptake while reducing soil microbial P, alleviating plant P limitation. A meta-analysis of 151 published articles confirmed that CN-induced increases in plant biomass and P uptake are widespread across forest ecosystems. Greater plant P uptake under CN was linked to higher fine root biomass, leaf transpiration rates, and P resorption efficiency. CN also stimulated soil acid phosphatase activity and phoC gene abundance, enhancing soil P availability for plants, resulting in reduced microbial and soil P pools compared with UN. These findings explain why high plant productivity persists in regions with high atmospheric N deposition and low P availability, with important implications for more accurately predicting plant productivity across forest ecosystems in a more realistic N deposition setting.

TI  - Farm biogas production in organic agriculture: System implications
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Current global energy needs and the effort to substitute fossil fuels have led to extensive production of biomass in agricultural systems for purposes of renewable and more sustainable energy. At the same time, large-scale industrialized energy crop production is criticized for various sustainability issues. Organic farming systems are said to alleviate the environmental burden of agricultural production by minimizing negative externalities and generating ecological benefits. However, organic agriculture is challenged for its lower productivity. Considering this food-energy-climate nexus, a large-scale conversion of agricultural land to organic management seems infeasible. Against this backdrop, this article presents the analysis of a combined system of organic farming and biomass energy production. With a systems approach, multiple agronomic effects caused by anaerobic digestion of residue and waste biomass in organic agriculture were reviewed and transferred into a conceptual diagrammatic model of a single farm. Dimensions reviewed include nitrogen dynamics, crop yield, product quality, crop rotations, weeds, plant health, and soil fertility. The systems analysis showed that farm biogas production bears potentials to enhance overall nitrogen supply and nitrogen use efficiency and to reduce labor and energy costs of the organic farm. System implications of these agronomical effects include changes in farm productivity, stability, and resilience. Through biogas integration organic farms may contribute to renewable energy supply without additional need for land, while simultaneously increasing food output and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from livestock manure. Therefore, this study indicates possibilities for the eco-functional intensification of organic farming systems that may contribute to solving the food-energy-climate nexus. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Long-term integrated soil-crop system management promoted rhizosphere nitrogen cycling and reduced N2O emission of maize
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - Context: Agricultural management practices are changing from the high-yield production to high-efficient production and now sustainable production in order to satisfy the increasing demand for food. We attempted to establish a high-yielding and high-efficient maize production practice, Integrated Soil-Crop System Management (ISCM). The ISCM increased yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), which could be due to changes in the composition and function of the rhizosphere bacterial community, and consequently nutrient utilization. Objectives: To investigate the rhizosphere microbial community composition response to different production practices and explore the impact of changes in rhizosphere microbes on nitrogen metabolism and yield of maize. Methods: Based on long-term treatment, optimizing aboveground population canopy and belowground nutrient management to set ISCM. A 12-year treatment was conducted in Tai'an City, Shandong Province, China, with four treatments. Results: The grain yield and dry matter increment of ISCM were increased by 42.7 % and 36.6 %, compared to farmers practices (FP), respectively, while reducing N2O emissions by 27.8 % and increasing nitrogen use efficiency by 63.7 %, mainly due to improved rhizosphere environments. The soil nitrogen cycle-related microorganisms under FP was decreased compared to ISCM. However, FP enhanced the function of microorganisms associated with gaseous nitrogen loss, resulting in higher N2O emissions and low NUE. The ISCM enriched a wider range of rhizosphere bacterial OTU species, including many nitrogen metabolism-related microorganisms, e.g., Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrococcales. This leads to faster soil N avalibilty to plants, maintain higher productivity, and reduce N losses. However, a super high-yield system (SY) had the highest yield and lowest NUE. Additinally, SY reduced the expression abundance of most microorganisms associated with the nitrogen cycle, but increased microorganisms gaseous of nitrogen loss function to increased N2O emission. Conclusions: The improved rhizosphere N metabolism promoted N uptake and reduced N2O emissions. These findings emphasize the availability of ISCM for sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - Polyethylene microplastics distinctly affect soil microbial community and carbon and nitrogen cycling during plant litter decomposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Plant litter is an important input source of carbon and nitrogen in soil. While microplastics (MPs) and plant litter are ubiquitously present in soil, their combined impact on soil biogeochemical processes remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we examined the soil changes resulting from the coexistence of plant litter (Alfalfa) and polyethylene microplastics (PE). The soil changes included physicochemical properties, composition of soil dissolved organic matter, and structure of the soil microbial community. The results showed that the addition of polyethylene (PE) inhibited the degradation of humus-like substances and decreased the quantity of humic acidlike compounds in soil dissolved organic matter (DOM). PE negatively impacted plant litter decomposition, disrupted soil organic carbon (SOC) breakdown, interfered with the nitrogen cycle, and significantly altered microbial community structures during the process. By day 35, SOC and total nitrogen (TN) levels were reduced by 39.8% and 10.1%, respectively, in the presence of PE. Furthermore, PE significantly decreased the abundance of nitrogen-fixing microbes, including Streptomyces (43.1%) and Bacillus (45.9%), which play key roles in nitrate reduction to ammonium. This study highlights the environmental effects of MPs on plant litter decomposition and their potential implications for soil biogeochemical processes.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Samples from the surface horizons of six virgin soils were collected and separated into density fractions. Based on the spatial distribution of organic materials within the mineral matrix of soil, the soil organic matter (SOM) contained in various density fractions was classified as: (a) free particulate OM, (b) occluded particulate OM, and (c) colloidal or clay-associated OM. The compositional differences noted among these three components of SOM were used to describe the changes that OM undergoes during decomposition when it enters the soil, is enveloped in aggregates and eventually is incorporated into microbial biomass and metabolites and associated with clay minerals.
   The occluded organic materials, released as a result of aggregate disruption, were in various stages of decomposition and had different degrees of association with mineral particles. Changes in the degree of association of occluded organic materials and mineral particles with decomposition are discussed and form the basis of a model which illustrates the simultaneous dynamics of microaggregates and their organic cores. This model indicates a major role for carbohydrate-rich plant debris in formation and stabilization of microaggregates.

TI  - Penguins significantly increased phosphine formation and phosphorus contribution in maritime Antarctic soils
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Most studies on phosphorus cycle in the natural environment focused on phosphates, with limited data available for the reduced phosphine (PH3). In this paper, matrix-bound phosphine (MBP), gaseous phosphine fluxes and phosphorus fractions in the soils were investigated from a penguin colony, a seal colony and the adjacent animal-lacking tundra and background sites. The MBP levels (mean 200.3 ng kg(-1)) in penguin colony soils were much higher than those in seal colony soils, animal-lacking tundra soils and the background soils. Field PH3 flux observation and laboratory incubation experiments confirmed that penguin colony soils produced much higher PH3 emissions than seal colony soils and animal-lacking tundra soils. Overall high MBP levels and PH3 emissions were modulated by soil biogeochemical processes associated with penguin activities: sufficient supply of the nutrients phosphorus, nitrogen, and organic carbon from penguin guano, high soil bacterial abundance and phosphatase activity. It was proposed that organic or inorganic phosphorus compounds from penguin guano or seal excreta could be reduced to PH3 in the Antarctic soils through the bacterial activity. Our results indicated that penguin activity significantly increased soil phosphine formation and phosphorus contribution, thus played an important role in phosphorus cycle in terrestrial ecosystems of maritime Antarctica.

TI  - Effects of a one-year rainfall manipulation on soil nematode abundances and community composition
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - Soil nematodes play a crucial role in the terrestrial nitrogen cycle by accelerating the release of ammonium from microorganisms (bacteria and fungi). As aquatic organisms, nematodes are likely to be affected by predicted changes in precipitation patterns and soil moisture during the 21st century. The objective of this study was to measure the response of soil nematodes to a one-year rainfall manipulation in the sandy, forest soils of the New Jersey Pinelands (USA). We excluded all rain from four replicate field plots and applied double the amount of natural rainfall to four additional plots. We then assessed the impact of these precipitation treatments on nematode abundance and community composition. We found that total nematode abundance increased with more precipitation, and were highly sensitive to annual precipitation amount. This is in contrast to microbial biomass which was previously found to be insensitive to precipitation change. We suggest that any increased microbial growth in high rainfall plots was consumed by microbivorous nematodes. We further suggest that nematodes in the freely draining, sandy soils we studied may be unsuccessful at surviving drought because few water-filled pore spaces remain, as compared to more aggregated soils. All nematode families were sensitive to drought, but the effect was greatest on the Plectidae, while no significant effects were found for the Cephalobidae and Qudsianematidae. While not directly measured, these results provide insight into the relative anhydrobiotic abilities of these families. We found that bacterial-feeding nematodes were most sensitive to drought, suggesting that grazer-induced alterations to the nitrogen cycle are possible if precipitation patterns change in the future.

TI  - Phylogenetic and Functional Diversity of Saprolegniales and Fungi Isolated from Temperate Lakes in Northeast Germany
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB  - The contribution of fungi to the degradation of plant litter and transformation of dissolved organic matter (humic substances, in particular) in freshwater ecosystems has received increasing attention recently. However, the role of Saprolegniales as one of the most common eukaryotic organisms is rarely studied. In this study, we isolated and phylogenetically placed 51 fungal and 62 Saprolegniales strains from 12 German lakes. We studied the cellulo-, lignino-, and chitinolytic activity of the strains using plate assays. Furthermore, we determined the capacity of 10 selected strains to utilize 95 different labile compounds, using Biolog FF MicroPlates (TM). Finally, the ability of three selected strains to utilize maltose and degrade/produce humic substances was measured. Cladosporium and Penicillium were amongst the most prevalent fungal strains, while Saprolegnia, Achlya, and Leptolegnia were the most frequent Saprolegniales strains. Although the isolated strains assigned to genera were phylogenetically similar, their enzymatic activity and physiological profiling were quite diverse. Our results indicate that Saprolegniales, in contrast to fungi, lack ligninolytic activity and are not involved in the production/transformation of humic substances. We hypothesize that Saprolegniales and fungi might have complementary roles in interacting with dissolved organic matter, which has ecological implications for carbon cycling in freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Climate modulates the magnitude of the effects of flow regulation on leaf-litter decomposition
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB  - The need of water for human use has led the impact on running waters of flow regulation to be of a global-scale. Although the effects of this impact have been widely investigated, efforts have been focused on large dams, so information about small reservoirs and their effects on ecosystem functioning is lacking. A recent collaborative project (IMPARIOS) addressed the effects of flow regulation by small impoundments on leaf-litter decomposition, a key function in low order streams which contributes greatly to the global carbon cycle. Flow regulation was found to affect ecosystem functioning reducing decomposition rate by altering shredders, but the magnitude of change varied among the different sub-climatic regions. The current project examined whether climatic variables modulate the effect of flow regulation on decomposition. For this, 19 bioclimatic variables were studied in relation to the leaf-litter decomposition rate and associated variables (sporulation rate and richness of aquatic hyphomycetes, and richness, density and biomass of total macroinvertebrates and shredders) in 17 streams impacted by regulation structures distributed in four sub-climatic regions within Spain. Overall, decomposition was slower below structures and climate influenced the magnitude of reduction. Effect sizes were negatively related to the seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation and to the general water deficit of the locations. In the future, the forecasted increase of seasonality in precipitation and temperature and the expected increase of number of dams to meet the needs of growing population may exacerbate the effects of flow regulation, altering nutrient recycling and the carbon cycle globally.

TI  - Soil Nematodes Regulate Ecosystem Multifunctionality Under Different Zokor Mounds in Qinghai-Tibet Alpine Grasslands
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a fragile high-altitude ecosystem where alpine grasslands are threatened by climate change and human disturbance. Plateau zokors create soil mounds that alter habitat conditions, but their effects on soil life and ecosystem functioning are poorly understood. We studied four mound types: undisturbed grassland, Potentilla anserina mounds, Leontopodium mounds, and bare new mounds. Soil nematodes were extracted and analyzed for abundance, diversity, functional indices, and metabolic footprints. Compared with undisturbed grassland, Potentilla mounds increased nematode abundance by up to 39%, while bare mounds raised dominance and bacterial pathway indicators but reduced diversity by up to 29%. Leontopodium mounds lowered nematode maturity and raised plant parasite levels. Soil nutrient cycling and multifunctionality were highest in undisturbed grassland and lowest in Leontopodium mounds. Moisture enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, while higher pH reduced carbon cycling. Overall, vegetation-covered zokor mounds influenced nutrient cycles and ecosystem multifunctionality by altering nematode communities. These findings improve our understanding of soil biodiversity-function relationships and provide practical guidance for restoring degraded alpine grasslands.Abstract The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's alpine grasslands are ecologically vulnerable. Plateau zokors build mounds that modify soil and vegetation, influencing soil biota. This study examined how different vegetation on zokor mounds affects soil nematodes and ecosystem function. We compared undisturbed grassland (CK), Potentilla anserina (PM) and Leontopodium (LM) mounds, and new bare mounds (NM). Soil nematode communities were analyzed to assess functional indices and metabolic footprints. Compared with CK, PM increased total nematode abundance by 37.74%, r-strategists by 36.54%, and K-strategists by 39.37%. NM increased dominance (lambda) by 22.20%, channel ratio (NCR) by 8.89%, and the Wasilewska index (WI) by 1.24 times, but reduced Shannon diversity by 8.49%, trophic diversity (TD) by 22.84%, and species richness (SR) by 29.40%. LM decreased the maturity index (MI) of free-living nematodes by 7.19% and increased the plant parasite index (PPI) by 10.01%. PM exhibited the highest metabolic footprints for bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores/predators, and total nematodes. Soil carbon (EF-C), nitrogen (EF-N), phosphorus (EF-P) cycling functions, and overall ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) were highest in CK and lowest in LM. Soil moisture had positive effects on EF-N, EF-P, and EMF, whereas pH had a negative effect on EF-C. These findings demonstrate that vegetation-covered zokor mounds influence nutrient cycling and ecosystem multifunctionality through changes in nematode community characteristics, providing new insights into soil biodiversity-function relationships and informing grassland restoration strategies in high-altitude ecosystems.

TI  - Microbial taxonomic, nitrogen cycling and phosphorus recycling community composition during long-term organic greenhouse farming
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the interplay between the farming system and soil microbiomes could aid the design of a sustainable and efficient farming system. A comparative greenhouse experiment consisting of organic (ORG), integrated (INT) and conventional (CON) farming systems was established in northern China in 2002. The effects of 12 years of organic farming on soil microbiomes were explored by metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses. Long-term ORG shifted the community composition of dominant phyla, especially Acidobacteria, increased the relative abundance of Ignavibacteria and Acidobacteria Gp6 and decreased the relative abundance of Nitrosomonas, Bacillus and Paenibacillus. Metagenomic analysis further revealed that relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms (Bacteria and Archaea) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria decreased during ORG. Conversely, the relative abundance of bacteria-carrying periplasmic nitrate reductases (napA) was slightly higher for ORG. Long-term organic farming also caused significant alterations to the community composition of functional groups associated with ammonia oxidation, denitrification and phosphorus recycling. In summary, this study provides key insights into the composition of soil microbiomes and long-term organic farming under greenhouse conditions.

TI  - N transformations in nitrate-rich groundwaters: combined isotope and microbial approach
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - This study explores nitrogen transformations in groundwater from an agricultural area utilizing organic fertilizer (wastewater from yeast production) by integrating isotope analysis, microbial gene abundance, and the isotope FRactionation And Mixing Evaluation (FRAME) model to trace and quantify nitrogen cycling pathways. Groundwater samples with elevated nitrate concentrations were subjected to controlled laboratory incubations with application of a novel low-level 15N tracing strategy to investigate microbial processes. Isotope analyses of nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide (N2O), coupled with microbial gene quantification via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), revealed a shift from archaeal-driven nitrification to bacterial denitrification in post-incubation suboxic conditions, stimulated by glucose addition. FRAME modelling further identified bacterial denitrification as the dominant pathway of N2O production, which was supported by increased nosZI, nirK, and nirS gene abundance and observed isotope effects.Simultaneously with the intensive nitrate reduction, it was observed that the majority of nitrite is likely produced through nitrification processes linked to dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) oxidation. Nitrate reduction had a minor contribution to the total nitrite pool. The results demonstrate the efficacy of integrating multi-compound isotope studies and microbial analyses to unravel nitrogen cycling mechanisms. This approach provides a robust framework for addressing nitrogen pollution in groundwater systems and improving water quality management strategies.

TI  - Fulvic Acid Enhances Nitrogen Fixation and Retention in Paddy Soils through Microbial-Coupled Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Fulvic acid, the most soluble and active humic substance, is widely used as an agent to remediate contaminated soils and improve soil fertility. However, the influence of fulvic acid (FA), as a microbial carbon source, on carbon and nitrogen cycles in paddy soils remains elusive. Therefore, to investigate it, an incubation experiment was conducted. Gas analyses indicated that the carbon dioxide and methane emissions were enhanced in FA treatment, which increased up to 94.08-fold and 5.06-fold, respectively. 15N-labeling experiments revealed that nitrogen fixation capability was promoted (1.2-fold) to reduce the carbon and nitrogen imbalance due to fulvic acid amendment. Metagenomic analysis further revealed that gene abundances of degradation of lignin-like compounds, gallate degradation, methanogenesis, nitrogen fixation, and urea hydrolysis increased, while the bacterial ammonia oxidation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation decreased, caused by FA application. Metabolic reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that Azospirillaceae, Methanosarcinaceae, and Bathyarchaeota, with higher abundance in FA treatment, were the key microorganisms to maintain the carbon and nitrogen balance. The metabolic pathways of fulvic acid degradation and coupled nitrogen fixation and retention were constructed. Collectively, our results provided novel insights into the theoretical basis of the use of humic substances for reducing nitrogen fertilization and climate change.

TI  - Controls on diel soil CO2 flux across moisture gradients in a polar desert
T2  - ANTARCTIC SCIENCE
AB  - The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica are a climate-sensitive ecosystem, where future projected climate warming will increase liquid water availability to release soil biology from physical limitations and alter ecosystem processes. For example, many studies have shown that CO2 flux, an important aspect of the carbon cycle, is controlled by temperature and moisture, which often overwhelm biotic contributions in desert ecosystems. However, these studies used either single-point measurements during peak times of biological activity or diel cycles at individual locations. Here, we present diel cycles of CO2 flux from a range of soil moisture conditions and a variety of locations and habitats to determine how diel cycles of CO2 flux vary across gradients of wet-to-dry soil and whether the water source influences the diel cycle of moist soil. Soil temperature, water content and microbial biomass significantly influenced CO2 flux. Soil temperature explained most of the variation. Soil CO2 flux moderately increased with microbial biomass, demonstrating a sometimes small but significant role of biological fluxes. Our results show that over gradients of soil moisture, both geochemical and biological fluxes contribute to soil CO2 flux, and physical factors must be considered when estimating biological CO2 flux in systems with low microbial biomass.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal effects on plant water relations and soil greenhouse gas emissions under changing moisture regimes
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Increased nutrient and/or water uptake by AM symbiosis may affect soil biochemical properties and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A greenhouse experiment was carried out to compare mycorrhizal tomato (76R MYC) and its non-mycorrhizal mutant (rmc) on the CO2 and N2O emissions from an organically-managed soil. Plants were grown for 10 weeks in pots with compost amended soil and subjected to two consecutive dry down cycles to simulate changing moisture regimes in the field. Dry downs were applied gradually through controlled watering treatments. The effects of AM and soil moisture in GHG emissions were assessed in root in-growth PVC cylinders installed in the pots. Gas samples were taken from the cylinders using static chambers 4 h after each watering event. Photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance of the plants were assessed after watering using a field portable open flow infra-red gas analyzer. Soil moisture was monitored throughout the experiment. Plant biomass and total shoot N, P and K as well as soil content of DON, DOC, NH4+-N, NO3--N and microbial biomass C, were assessed at harvest. For the same shoot growth and nutrient content, rmc plants allocated more resources to root biomass than mycorrhizal plants. AM symbiosis improved the capacity of the plants to adapt to changing soil moisture, increasing photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance at high soil moisture but decreasing them when soil moisture was lower. In addition AM symbiosis helped to regulate N2O emissions at high soil moisture. Control over N2O emissions by AM plants seemed to be driven by a higher use of soil water and not by increased N uptake. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nitrogen Deposition Enhanced the Effect of Solidago Canadensis Invasion on Soil Microbial Metabolic Limitation and Carbon Use Efficiency
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB  - Solidago canadensis, considered one of the most destructive invasive species of the 21st century, has inflicted severe ecological damage globally. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms through which nitrogen deposition impacts the metabolism of soil microorganisms across various vegetation communities remain largely unexplored. Consequently, this study sought to elucidate patterns of change in microbial metabolic constraints and carbon use efficiency across six distinct vegetation communities, aiming to uncover the carbon cycling process within soil ecosystems. Our findings reveal that multi-vegetation communities exhibit greater resilience to the incursion of Solidago canadensis than their single-vegetation counterparts, demonstrating weaker microbial carbon constraints and higher carbon use efficiency. Furthermore, a positive correlation was determined between microbial carbon use efficiency and carbon constraints. Driven by soil nutrients, nitrogen deposition synergistically interacts with Solidago canadensis, thereby influencing soil microbial carbon use efficiency. Thus, our experiment provides an initial perspective on the variations in metabolic limitations and carbon use efficiency amongst soil microbes across different vegetation communities. Such insights hold potential implications for future research focused on the feedback and responses of carbon cycles within varied vegetation community ecosystems to invasions in the context of increasing nitrogen deposition.

TI  - Wood-Feeding Termites
T2  - SAPROXYLIC INSECTS: DIVERSITY, ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Termites originated from wood-feeding cockroaches and are dominant members of the saproxylic insect community in many tropical and subtropical biomes. Their ecological role comprises comminution (shredding) of dead organic material, bioturbation (mixing of organic and mineral material in soil horizons) and lignocellulose digestion (contributing to the decomposition arm of the global carbon cycle). The key adaptations of termites are their symbioses, mainly internal, with protists, archaea, bacteria and (in a special case) fungi. Thus the evolution of modern termites from the detritus-feeding common ancestor of termites and wood-feeding cockroaches can be reconstructed as a stepwise process to secure the transfer of increasingly specialised intestinal symbionts from parent to offspring. This selection resulted in the extant eusociality of all termites, characterised by generational overlap, proctodaeal feeding, altricial development, paedomorphosis and co-evolution with microorganisms. An account is given of their typical abundance, biomass, trophic diversification and impacts on soil health and the terrestrial carbon cycle. Termite behaviour associated with finding and consuming woody resources is also considered. An overview of the symbioses between termites and microbes is presented, focused on recent work revealing the relative contributions of host and microbiota to the digestion of lignocellulose. A separate account of the fungus-growing subfamily Macrotermitinae is added, as their impact on organic decomposition in Africa and Asia is substantial.

TI  - Responses of Bacterial Communities in Soils under Winter Wheat to Nightly Warming and Nitrogen Addition
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Understanding soil bacterial diversity under global warming is necessary because of its crucial role in soil nitrogen cycling. However, the interaction effect of warmer temperatures and nitrogen application on bacterial communities in the soils of winter wheat fields is unclear. In this study, the air temperature was increased with infrared heating, and this heating treatment was combined with nitrogen fertilizer application. The two-year continuous temperature increase significantly decreased the soil's pH and nitrate nitrogen content, but significantly increased the content of soil available nutrients. Warming changed the community structure of the soil bacteria, and significantly increased the bacterial richness and diversity by 17.77% and 3.52%, respectively. The changes in the physical and chemical properties of the soil caused by the increased nighttime temperature decreased the percentage abundance of Pseudomonadota, which is the largest bacterial phylum, and plays an important role in the global carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles. The structural equation model demonstrated that the influence of soil temperature on bacterial diversity was mediated through soil moisture. Nitrogen application rate directly affected soil bacterial diversity and was the most significant parameter influencing bacterial diversity.

TI  - THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT SOIL-MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES ON CARBON-CYCLE COMPONENTS IN AN ENTIC HAPLUDOLL
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
AB  - Sampling on different plots of a field located in Pehuajo, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, on an Entic Hapludoll, was conducted to determine the effect of different soil management procedures on carbon cycle components. The plots studied were: A) eight years of mixed pasture followed by oat (Avena sativa L.) crop, B) five years of mixed pasture followed by maize (Zea mays L.) with direct drilling, and C) five years of mixed pasture followed by maize crop with conventional tillage. The sampling was done during the month of June 1994. By that time, plot A was in oat production and plots B and C were in fallow. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) values differed significantly between the three plots, whereas no differences were found in the organic carbon (OC) content. Plots B and C differed both in respiration and qCO2 (the ratio between C-CO2 released by respioration and the microbial biomass C). For the latter, no differences had been found as a function of the tillage system in a previous work that was carried out on another region of Argentina. Theoretical calculations on the CO2 release from the soil to the atmosphere were inferred from the respiration values previously found.

TI  - The global contribution of roots to total soil respiration
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim Soil respiration (R-S) is one of the largest fluxes in the global carbon cycle. It is composed of respiration by roots and heterotrophic organisms, with each component having distinctive drivers and sensitivities and, consequently, varying feedback potential to climate change. Global drivers of the total flux of R-S are widely studied and generally accepted, but our understanding of the factors governing its component fluxes lags far behind. Location Global. Time period 1962-2015. Major taxa studied Plant roots and soil microbes. Methods Combining a newly updated global database of R-S partitioning measurements with biotic and abiotic variables, we examined the world-wide distribution of the proportion of the annual root respiration (R-root) contribution to R-S (R-root:R-S). We investigated how R-root:R-S varies by ecosystem type, measurement method and climate. We used a random forest model to predict the relationship between field measurements of R-root:R-S (n = 880) and 14 biotic and abiotic factors, including climate, nitrogen deposition, soil, mycorrhiza, biomass and satellite-derived greenness. Finally, we present a global map of predicted R-root:R-S at 0.5 degrees resolution. Results Consistent with previous studies, we found no clear trends of mean R-root:R-S across ecosystem types and measurement methods. The area-weighted overall mean of predicted R-root:R-S was .42 (SD +/- .18; i.e., 42% of total global R-S was generated by plant roots). Predicted R-root:R-S and related environmental factors did exhibit clear spatial patterns between climatic regions, with higher R-root:R-S in dry and cold regions and lower R-root:R-S in temperate and tropical regions. Main conclusions Given that R-root:R-S is linked to plant carbon use efficiency (CUE, the ratio of net primary production to gross primary production), but generated from measurements completely independent of plant CUE, it might provide crucial insights into ecosystem- to global-scale carbon cycling. This study thus provides a framework to explore global carbon allocation under global climate change.

TI  - Effects of elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and tropospheric O3 on decomposition of fine roots
T2  - TREE PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration ([CO2]) could alter terrestrial carbon (C) cycling by affecting plant growth, litter chemistry and decomposition. How the concurrent increase in tropospheric ozone (O-3) concentration ([O-3]) will interact with rising atmospheric [CO2] to affect C cycling is unknown. A major component of carbon cycling in forests is fine root production, mortality and decomposition. To better understand the effects of elevated [CO2] and [O-3] on the dynamics of fine root C, we conducted a combined field and laboratory incubation experiment to monitor decomposition dynamics and changes in fine root litter chemistry. Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology at the FACTS-II Aspen FACE project in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, elevated [CO2] (535 mu l l(-1)) and [O-3] (53 nl l(-1)) in intact stands of pure trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and in mixed stands of trembling aspen plus paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and trembling aspen plus sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.). We hypothesized that the trees would react to increased C availability (elevated [CO2]) by increasing allocation to C-based secondary compounds (CBSCs), thereby decreasing rates of decomposition. Because of its lower growth potential, we reasoned this effect would be greatest in the aspen-maple community relative to the aspen and aspen-birch communities. As a result of decreased C availability, we expected elevated [O-3] to counteract shifts in C allocation induced by elevated [CO2]. Concentrations of CBSCs were rarely significantly affected by the CO2 and O-3 treatments in decomposing fine roots. Rates of microbial respiration and mass loss from fine roots were unaffected by the treatments, although the production of dissolved organic C differed among communities. We conclude that elevated [CO2] and [O-3] induce only small changes in fine root chemistry that are insufficient to significantly influence fine root decomposition. If changes in soil C cycling occur in the future, they will most likely be brought about by changes in litter production.

TI  - Exposure to nanoplastics disturbs the gut microbiome in the soil oligochaete Enchytraeus crypticus
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Microplastics are emerging pollutants that have recently aroused considerable concern but most toxicological studies have focused on marine biota, with little investigation of the influence of microplastics on terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we fed the soil oligochaete Enchytraeus crypticus with oatmeal containing 0, 0.025, 0.5, and 10% (dry weight basis) nano-polystyrene (0.05-0.1 mu m particle size) to elucidate the impact of microplastics on the growth and gut microbiome of Enchytraeus crypticus. We observed a significant reduction of weight in the animals fed 10% polystyrene and an increase in the reproduction of those fed 0.025%. More importantly, using 16S rRNA amplification and high-throughput sequencing we found a significant shift in the microbiome of those fed 10% microplastics with significant decreases in the relative abundance of the families Rhizobiaceae, Xanthobacteraceae and Isosphaeraceae. These families contain key microbes that contribute to nitrogen cycling and organic matter decomposition. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nitrification and Denitrification Gene Abundances under Stable Soil Chemical Properties Established by Long-Term Compost Fertilization
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Rice paddies are dynamic areas for microbe-mediated nitrogen cycling and this could be driven by the long-term alteration of paddy soil edaphic factors. The objective of this study is to evaluate the lasting impact of long-term compost fertilization on the soil chemical properties of paddy fields, determining the size of the microbial guilds involved in nitrification and denitrification. Soil sampling was done on paddy fields without fertilizer, with NPK + compost, and with compost application, and the soil chemical properties of the fields were determined from 2018 to 2021. The abundance of genes related to nitrogen cycling was measured using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Annual analyses showed that the studied soils have attained stable, baseline chemical properties with significantly increased phosphorus (P2O5), potassium (K), SOM, and total nitrogen (TN) due to decades of fertilization with NPK + compost and compost. Consequently, the genes related to bacterial amoA, nosZI, and nosZII were significantly increased in Com- and NPKCom-amended soils compared to the NF paddy field. The nirK gene abundance was unaffected after long-term amendment with compost. A positive correlation was found between the archaeal amoA gene abundance and DOC, while SOM and TN were consistently positively correlated with the abundances of bacterial amoA, nosZI, and nosZII genes, in addition to interactions with potassium and DOC. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated soil variabilities across treatments, where the unfertilized paddy field contained lower SOM and nutrient contents with a characteristic nirK gene abundance. Similar variabilities in terms of the SOM, TN, K, nosZI, and nosZII gene abundances were observed in the Com and NPKCom paddy fields. Long-term amendment with NPK + compost and compost created soil paddy fields with stable soil chemical properties with higher SOM and nutrient contents, which established higher abundances of genes associated with denitrification and nitrification that were observed during the fallow period.

TI  - Plant property regulates soil bacterial community structure under altered precipitation regimes in a semi-arid desert grassland, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
AB  - Variations of precipitation have great impacts on soil carbon cycle and decomposition of soil organic matter. Soil bacteria are crucial participants in regulating these ecological processes and vulnerable to altered precipitation. Studying the impacts of altered precipitation on soil bacterial community structure can provide a novel insight into the potential impacts of altered precipitation on soil carbon cycle and carbon storage of grassland. Therefore, soil bacterial community structure under a precipitation manipulation experiment was researched in a semi-arid desert grassland in Chinese Loess Plateau. Five precipitation levels, i.e., control, reduced and increased precipitation by 40% and 20%, respectively (referred here as CK, DP40, DP20, IP40, and IP20) were set. The results showed that soil bacterial alpha diversity and rare bacteria significantly changed with altered precipitation, but the dominant bacteria and soil bacterial beta diversity did not change, which may be ascribed to the ecological strategy of soil bacteria. The linear discriminate analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) method found that major response patterns of soil bacteria to altered precipitation were resource-limited and drought-tolerant populations. In addition, increasing precipitation greatly promoted inter-species competition, while decreasing precipitation highly facilitated inter-species cooperation. These changes in species interaction can promote different distribution ratios of bacterial populations under different precipitation conditions. In structural equation model (SEM) analysis, with changes in precipitation, plant growth characteristics were found to be drivers of soil bacterial community composition, while soil properties were not. In conclusion, our results indicated that in desert grassland ecosystem, the sensitive of soil rare bacteria to altered precipitation was stronger than that of dominant taxa, which may be related to the ecological strategy of bacteria, species interaction, and precipitation-induced variations of plant growth characteristics.

TI  - Temperature thresholds drive the global distribution of soil fungal decomposers
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Unraveling the biogeographic pattern of soil fungal decomposers along temperature gradients-in smooth linearity or an abrupt jump-can help us connect the global carbon cycle to global warming. Through a standardized global field survey, we identify the existence of temperature thresholds that control the global distribution of soil fungal decomposers, leading to abrupt reductions in their proportion (i.e., the relative abundance in the fungal community) immediately after crossing particular air and soil temperature thresholds. For example, small increases over the mean annual temperature threshold of similar to 9 degrees C result in abrupt reductions in their proportion, paralleling a similar temperature threshold for soil carbon content. We further find that the proportion of soil fungal decomposers is more sensitive to temperature increases under arid conditions. Given the positive correlation between the global distributions of fungal decomposers and soil heterotrophic respiration, the reported temperature-driven abrupt reductions in fungal decomposers could further suppress their driven soil decomposition processes and reduce carbon fluxes from soils to the atmosphere with implications for climate change feedback. This work not only advances the current knowledge on the global distribution of soil fungal decomposers, but also highlights that small changes in temperature around certain thresholds can lead to potential unexpected consequences in global carbon cycling under projected climate change.

TI  - Synergetic effect of antibiotic mixtures on soil bacterial N2O-reducing communities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS
AB  - Antibiotics released in agricultural soils alter soil bacterial communities, inducing antimicrobial resistance and, in turn, canceling the efficiency of antibiotic drugs used for human and animal health. In soils, antibiotic impact on nitrogen cycling is poorly known, notably when antibiotic mixtures are applied. We hypothesized that the impact of antibiotic mixtures would have higher effects on denitrification. We exposed soil denitrifying bacteria enrichments to tetracycline, ofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole and tylosin, either applied single or as mixture of three antibiotics, during 7 days under denitrifying conditions. We measured the minimum inhibitory concentration of the N2O-reducing capacity of the bacterial enrichment, we deduced the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) from the experimental data and from the concentration addition hypothesis, and we quantifiednosZgene abundances. Results show that single antibiotic exposure inhibited N2O-reduction only for tetracycline at 64 mg/L. Inhibition by antibiotic mixtures always exceeded the modeled inhibition calculated by concentration addition. At high-antibiotic exposure,nosZgene clade I denitrifiers remained abundant, of 10(7)-10(8)copies/ng DNA.NosZgene clade II denitrifiers increased with antibiotic concentrations. Our findings reveal for the first time the synergistic effects of antibiotic mixtures on soil nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Food Web Uncertainties Influence Predictions of Climate Change Effects on Soil Carbon Sequestration in Heathlands
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Carbon cycling models consider soil carbon sequestration a key process for climate change mitigation. However, these models mostly focus on abiotic soil processes and, despite its recognized critical mechanistic role, do not explicitly include interacting soil organisms. Here, we use a literature study to show that even a relatively simple soil community (heathland soils) contains large uncertainties in temporal and spatial food web structure. Next, we used a Lotka-Volterra-based food web model to demonstrate that, due to these uncertainties, climate change can either increase or decrease soil carbon sequestration to varying extents. Both the strength and direction of changes strongly depend on (1) the main consumer's (enchytraeid worms) feeding preferences and (2) whether decomposers (fungi) or enchytraeid worms are more sensitive to stress. Hence, even for a soil community with a few dominant functional groups and a simulation model with a few parameters, filling these knowledge gaps is a critical first step towards the explicit integration of soil food web dynamics into carbon cycling models in order to better assess the role soils play in climate change mitigation.

TI  - Structure and Function of Rhizosphere Bacterial Communities in the Endangered Plant Abies ziyuanensis
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Rhizosphere microbiota are key drivers of plant nutrition, immunity, and stress tolerance. Abies ziyuanensis L. K. Fu & S. L. Mo (Pinaceae) is an endangered conifer endemic to China, and its persistence may depend on its interactions with its belowground microbiome. However, how soil-borne bacterial functional groups respond to, and potentially support, A. ziyuanensis remains unclear. Based on amplicon high-throughput sequencing data of the 16S rRNA gene and soil physicochemical properties, the bacterial community structure in the rhizosphere soil of A. ziyuanensis in Yinzhu Laoshan National Nature Reserve in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, was analyzed, and the potential ecological functions and phenotypic characteristics of the bacterial community were predicted to determine the functional taxa characteristics (nitrogen cycle, phototrophy, and chemoheterotrophy) and dominant soil environmental factors. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi were the dominant bacterial taxa in the A. ziyuanensis rhizosphere soil, and all bacteria were significantly positively correlated with soil NO3--N (R = 0.47, p = 0.0079). Based on FAPROTAX, the A. ziyuanensis rhizosphere soil bacterial community had chemoheterotrophic-related functions, which were more prevalent than nitrogen cycle- and phototrophic-related functions, and the relative abundance of bacteria with nitrogen cycle-related functions was higher than that of those with phototrophic functions. The nitrogen nutrient- and phototrophic-related functional taxa in the rhizosphere soil bacterial community had significant correlations with soil physicochemical properties, whereas the chemoheterotrophic-related functional taxa did not show a significant correlation. Based on BugBase phenotype prediction, Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi made the greatest contribution to the phenotype, with pathogenic and stress tolerance being the most important phenotypes. The pathogenic and stress-tolerant bacteria all belonged to Proteobacteria. The rhizosphere bacteria exhibited rich diversity and dominated several biogeochemical cycling processes. This study identifies beneficial rhizosphere bacteria of A. ziyuanensis, providing a theoretical basis for conserving soil bacterial diversity and guiding the targeted recruitment of functional bacteria by the endangered plant.

TI  - Characteristics of greenhouse gas emissions from farmland soils based on a structural equation model: Regulation mechanism of biochar
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soil carbon and nitrogen cycles during freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) provide positive feedback to climate warming. Biochar is a new type of soil conditioner that shows potential in soil GHG emissions reduction. To explore the mechanisms of the effects of biochar on soil GHG emissions in seasonally frozen soil areas, this study focused on farmland soil in the Songnen Plain. Variations in soil environmental factors, available carbon and nitrogen and microbial biomass were analyzed using an indoor simulation of soil FTCs. A structural equation model (SEM) was established to reveal the key driving factors and potential mechanism of biochar on soil GHG emissions under FTCs. The results showed that biochar increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 3.40% and methane (CH4) absorption by 2.52% and decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 35.90%. SEM showed that soil temperature (ST) was the main environmental factor determining CO2 emissions and that soil moisture (SM) was the main environmental factor determining CH4 and N2O emissions. Soil available carbon and nitrogen and microbial biomass are important for soil GHG emissions as the reaction substrates and main participants in the biochemical transformation of soil carbon and nitrogen, respectively. This study showed that the application of biochar in farmland is a feasible choice to address climate change in the long term via soil carbon sequestration and GHG emissions reduction. The research results provide a theoretical basis and scientific guidance for soil GHG emissions reduction during FTCs in middle to high latitudes.

TI  - Differential Response of Wheat Rhizosphere Bacterial Community to Plant Variety and Fertilization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - The taxonomic assemblage and functions of the plant bacterial community are strongly influenced by soil and host plant genotype. Crop breeding, especially after the massive use of nitrogen fertilizers which led to varieties responding better to nitrogen fertilization, has implicitly modified the ability of the plant root to recruit an effective bacterial community. Among the priorities for harnessing the plant bacterial community, plant genotype-by-microbiome interactions are stirring attention. Here, we analyzed the effect of plant variety and fertilization on the rhizosphere bacterial community. In particular, we clarified the presence in the bacterial community of a varietal effect of N and P fertilization treatment. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis of rhizospheric soil, collected from four wheat varieties grown under four N-P fertilization regimes, and quantification of functional bacterial genes involved in the nitrogen cycle (nifH; amoA; nirK and nosZ) were performed. Results showed that variety played the most important role and that treatments did not affect either bacterial community diversity or bacterial phyla abundance. Variety-specific response of rhizosphere bacterial community was detected, both in relation to taxa (Nitrospira) and metabolic functions. In particular, the changes related to amino acid and aerobic metabolism and abundance of genes involved in the nitrogen cycle (amoA and nosZ), suggested that plant variety may lead to functional changes in the cycling of the plant-assimilable nitrogen.

T2  - CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Bacillus asahii strain OM18, a bacterium in relation to soil fertility, was isolated from alkaline soils under long-term organic manure application in the North China Plain. B. asahii species play a pivotal role in the promotion of both crop yield and soil fertility via accelerating carbon and phosphorus cycling. However, little is known about the characteristics of B. asahii and its underlying molecular mechanism involved in soil nutrient cycling as well as its potential in promoting crop growth. To this end, we report the characteristics and complete genome analysis of strain OM18, which is relevant to promoting plant growth in phosphorus-deficient alkaline soils. Our results provide a glimpse into the metabolic function of B. asahii OM18.

TI  - Effects of tillage patterns and stover mulching on N2O production, nitrogen cycling genes and microbial dynamics in black soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Stover-covered no-tillage (NT) is of great significance to the rational utilization of stover resources and improvement of cultivated land quality, and also has a profound impact on ensuring groundwater, food and ecosystem security. However, the effects of tillage patterns and stover mulching on soil nitrogen turnover remain elusive. Based on the long-term conservation tillage field experiment in the mollisol area of Northeast China since 2007, the shotgun metagenomic sequencing of soils and microcosm incubation were combined with physical and chemical analyses, alkyne inhibition analysis to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of NT and stover mulching on the farmland soil nitrogen emissions and microbial nitrogen cycling genes. Compared with conventional tillage (CT), NT stover mulching significantly reduced the emission of N2O instead of CO2, especially when 33% mulching was adopted, and correspondingly the nitrate nitrogen of NT33 was higher than that of other mulching amounts. The stover mulching was associated with higher total nitrogen, soil organic carbon and pH. The abundance of AOB (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria)-amoA (ammonia monooxygenase subunit A) was substantially increased by stover mulching, while the abundance of denitrification genes was reduced in most cases. Under alkyne inhibition, the tillage mode, treatment time, gas condition and interactions between them noticeably influenced the N2O emission and nitrogen transformation. In CT, NT0 (no mulching) and NT100 (full mulching), the relative contribution of AOB to N2O production was markedly higher than that of ammonia oxidizing archaea. Different tillage modes were associated with distinct microbial community composition, albeit NT100 was closer to CT than to NT0. Compared with CT, the co-occurrence network of microbial communities was more complex in NT0 and NT100. Our findings suggest that maintaining a low-quantity stover mulching could regulate soil nitrogen turnover toward proficiently enhancing soil health and regenerative agriculture, and coping with global climate change.

TI  - Biodegradable plastics: Effects on functionality and fertility of two different soils
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - In agriculture, the use of soil biodegradable mulch films could represent an eco-friendly alternative to conventional plastic films. However, soil biodegradable mulch films incorporated into the soil through tillage, being not only a physical but also a biogeochemical input, is expected to influence the soil quality by affecting its functions. Therefore, the eco-compatibility of these biodegradable plastics needs to be evaluated for their impact on different soil functions. To understand the effect of biodegradable plastics on soil quality (i.e. microbial biomass, nitrogen cycle, and activity of soil enzymes involved in the biochemical processes of carbon and nitrogen), we added increasing quantities of biodegradable plastics in two different soils: a loamy (Cambisol) and sandy (Arenosol) soil. The results highlight that the carbon added through the biodegradable plastics influenced the processes linked to carbon and nitrogen cycles. Significant effects were observed mainly with the highest dose of biodegradable plastics added (1%), resulting in a higher growth of microbial biomass, increased carbon mineralisation, and increased immobilisation of available nitrogen. The results also underline the importance of evaluating the impact of biodegradable plastics in different soils because all the processes considered are also influenced also by soil physicochemical characteristics.

TI  - Aridity-induced nonlinear shifts in soil organic carbon across Chinese grasslands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems that plays a key role in global carbon cycling and climate regulation. However, the patterns of SOC variation along aridity gradients remain poorly characterized, particularly under varying aridity conditions. To address this gap, we surveyed 192 sites across nine provinces in China, spanning environmental gradients from humid to extremely arid regions. Our findings revealed a distinct threshold at an aridity level of 0.77, beyond which SOC accumulation and stability became more closely associated with microbial diversity and soil enzyme activity, while the influence of vegetation and nutrient inputs declined significantly. Notably, beta-glucosidase activity showed strong correlations with SOC dynamics under severe aridity. These results indicate that intensified aridity conditions shift the biotic and abiotic correlates of SOC, emphasizing the increasing relevance of microbial and enzymatic characteristics under arid environments. This study highlights the nonlinear response of SOC to aridity and identifies a critical threshold at an aridity level of 0.77, underscoring the potential value of microbial and enzymatic indicators in monitoring soil carbon changes. These findings provide important insights into the vulnerability of grassland soil carbon stocks and offer a scientific basis for developing adaptive management strategies to conserve carbon sinks under future climate scenarios.

TI  - Primer Sets Developed for Functional Genes Reveal Shifts in Functionality of Fungal Community in Soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Phylogenetic diversity of soil microbes is a hot topic at the moment. However, the molecular tools for the assessment of functional diversity in the fungal community are less developed than tools based on genes encoding the ribosomal operon. Here 20 sets of primers targeting genes involved mainly in carbon cycling were designed and/or validated and the functioning of soil fungal communities along a chronosequence of land abandonment from agriculture was evaluated using them. We hypothesized that changes in fungal community structure during secondary succession would lead to difference in the types of genes present in soils and that these changes would be directional. We expected an increase in genes involved in degradation of recalcitrant organic matter in time since agriculture. Out of the investigated genes, the richness of the genes related to carbon cycling was significantly higher in fields abandoned for longer time. The composition of six of the genes analyzed revealed significant differences between fields abandoned for shorter and longer time. However, all genes revealed significant variance over the fields studied, and this could be related to other parameters than the time since agriculture such as pH, organic matter, and the amount of available nitrogen. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the genes significantly different between fields were not related to the decomposition of more recalcitrant matter but rather involved in degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose.

TI  - Mixed plantations can promote microbial integration and soil nitrate increases with changes in the N cycling genes
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Mixed-species plantations of Eucalyptus and legume trees can symbiotically fix nitrogen and potentially improve the soil quality and biomass productivity compared with a conventional Eucalyptus monoculture. In this study, we evaluated changes in the structure and abundance of different microbial groups and nitrogen cycle genes in mixed and pure plantations of Acacia mangium and Eucalyptus urograndis in an experimental area in southeastern Brazil. Soil samples (0-10 cm) collected in two- and three-year-old stands were submitted to chemical characterization and molecular analyses using DGGE and real time-PCR for bacteria (16S rRNA), fungi (ITS), and genes involved in nitrogen cycling (nirK, amoA, nifH). The mixed plantation did not significantly change general soil fertility or total soil C and N content compared with the Eucalyptus monoculture. However, there was a significant increase in available phosphorus and soil nitrate content in both the A. mangium and mixed-species treatments. The multivariate ordination of the DGGE profiles of bacteria, fungi and archaea groups showed distinct community structures in each treatment. Significant differences in the abundance of copies of the target genes were found for fungi, with higher values in the Eucalyptus followed by the mixed and A. mangium plantations. The analysis of nitrogen cycle genes showed no clear difference in the communities of nitrogen fixing bacteria or nitrifying archaea among treatments. The nitrification activity was dominated by archaea because it was not possible to detect the presence of bacterial nitrifiers; the denitrifier community had a distinct profile in the Eucalyptus monoculture. The abundance of archaeal amoA and nirK genes suggests that the A. mangium treatment had higher nitrification and lower denitrification than the other treatments, which would explain the higher soil nitrate levels found in pure A. mangium treatments. Our data suggest that mixed plantations of E. urograndis and A. mangium result in a distinct microbial community relative to the respective monocultures with positive effects on soil phosphorus and nitrate content, which potentially reduces the need for anthropogenic fertilization.

TI  - Effects of Intercropping Tea Plants with Bamboo Fungus on Soil Physical/Chemical Properties and Microbial Community Diversity
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB  - Long-term monoculture of tea plants can harm soil ecosystems, while intercropping is considered a sustainable agricultural strategy that enhances ecological stability. However, the effects of intercropping tea plants with bamboo fungus on their growth remain unclear. This study conducted a field experiment to compare the soil physicochemical properties of tea plants under monoculture and intercropping with bamboo fungus, and assessed microbial community diversity through high-throughput sequencing. Results indicated that intercropping with bamboo fungus significantly improved soil water retention, with soil water-holding capacity and field water-holding capacity increasing by 49.07% and 48.77%, respectively. Soil nutrient availability was notably enhanced, with organic matter, available phosphorus, and available potassium increasing by 22.5%, 80.21%, and 56.13%, respectively. Bacterial community composition shifted markedly under intercropping, with significant enrichment of Gemmatimonadota, Devosia, and Conexibacter. Functional analysis revealed a restructuring of nitrogen cycling processes, characterized by increased nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and nitrogen respiration. Co-occurrence network analysis indicated higher modularity and eigencentrality in intercropped soils, suggesting enhanced microbial interactions and ecological resilience. These findings highlight that bamboo fungus intercropping reshapes soil physicochemical properties and enriches beneficial microbial taxa, thereby offering a sustainable approach to improve soil fertility and ecosystem functionality in tea plantations.

TI  - Old carbon routed from land to the atmosphere by global river systems
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Rivers and streams are an important pathway in the global carbon cycle, releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from their water surfaces to the atmosphere1,2. Until now, CO2 and CH4 emitted from rivers were thought to be predominantly derived from recent (sub-decadal) biomass production and, thus, part of ecosystem respiration3, 4, 5-6. Here we combine new and published measurements to create a global database of the radiocarbon content of river dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), CO2 and CH4. Isotopic mass balance of our database suggests that 59 +/- 17% of global river CO2 emissions are derived from old carbon (millennial or older), the release of which is linked to river catchment lithology and biome. This previously unrecognized release of old, pre-industrial-aged carbon to the atmosphere from long-term soil, sediment and geologic carbon stores through lateral hydrological routing equates to 1.2 +/- 0.3 Pg C year-1, similar in magnitude to terrestrial net ecosystem exchange. A consequence of this flux is a greater than expected net loss of carbon from aged organic matter stores on land. This requires a reassessment of the fate of anthropogenic carbon in terrestrial systems and in global carbon cycle budgets and models.

TI  - Effects of crop types and nitrogen fertilization on temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in the semi-arid Loess Plateau
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Qio) is an important mechanism for the possible feedback between global carbon cycle and climate system. Knowledge of how crop types and nitrogen (N) fertilization affect Qio is critical for estimating soil respiration and carbon cycling in agro-ecosystem. A two-year field experiment was conducted with cold-resistant (winter wheat; Triticum aestivum L) and thermophilic (spring maize; Zea mays L.) crops at two N fertilization levels (no fertilization (CK) and 160 kgN hm(-1)) from October 2013 to September 2015 in semi-arid Loess Plateau. Annual mean soil respiration and Qio in maize were 20% (1.85 vs. 1.54 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and 36% (2.49 vs.1.83) higher than that in wheat. Nitrogen fertilization resulted in a 35% increase in annual mean soil respiration (1.95 vs. 1.44 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and a 11% decrease in Qio (2.05 vs. 2.28) compared with the CK treatment. Soil respiration was positively related to root biomass, whereas no significant relationship was found between root biomass and Qio. Therefore, it can be concluded that soil respiration and temperature sensitivity of soil respiration are significantly influenced by crop types and N fertilization regimes, which should be considered in calculating carbon budget in agro-ecosystem using carbon models.

TI  - Response of soil enzyme activities and bacterial communities to the accumulation of microplastics in an acid cropped soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The ecological stress of microplastics (MPs) contamination in agroecosystems raise worldwide concerns. However very few studies concentrated on the effects of MPs exposure on soil microbial community. The alterations of enzymatic activities and bacterial communities were assayed by spiking 1% and 5% (w/w) of polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs in an acid soil. The results showed that both PE and PVC addition inhibited fluorescein diacetate hydrolase activity and stimulated urease and acid phosphatase activities, and declined the richness and diversity of the bacterial communities. More severe effects were observed in the PE treated soils compared to the PVC treated soils generally. The relative abundances of families Burkholderiaceae increased significantly (p < .05) after MPs addition, suggesting the bacteria associated with nitrogen fixation stimulated by the MPs input. Meanwhile, significant (p < .05) decline of Sphingomonadaceae and Xanthobacteraceae after addition of 5% PVC and 1% PE MPs, respectively implied that MPs might inhibit the biodegradation of xenobiotics in the soil. Mover, the PICRUSt analysis demonstrated that membrane transporter was a sensitive prediction functional gene of microplastics exposure in the soil. Future studies could be focused on the role of MPs on the regulation of nitrogen cycling and organic compounds degradation in soils. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Iron-nitrogen coupling mediates soil microbial community composition and gene expression during the formation of rusty root in Panax ginseng from three northeast provinces in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Ginseng, a crucial medicinal plant in China, faces challenges due to rusty roots (GRR). Our early work linked GRR to nitrate-reducing Fe (II) oxidation (NRFO). However, the interaction between the NRFO and soil microorganisms how impact the GRR occurrence remain elusive. To elucidate how iron and nitrogen influence microbial community structure, diversity and functional characteristics during the soil of GRR occurrence. Here, we showed that the GRR occurred might be related to the soil microbial abundance associated with NRFO increased, such as Shewanella, Geobacter and Acidovorax (P < 0.05). Interestingly, LeFSe analysis suggested that soil microorganism (Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium) involved in nitrogen cycling were enriched in GRR soils (P < 0.05, LDA > 2.5). Moreover, structural equation model analysis showed that increasing pH-mediated Fe (II) content and upregulation of expression genes (i.e., K15637) controlling microbial cell death may be significantly correlated with the decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.05), thus increasing the occurrence index of GRR (P < 0.01). Additionally, metagenomics function annotations indicated that the genes enriched in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis and the carbohydrate uptakes were decreased, which may also be one of the factors contributing to the aggravation of GRR. Furthermore, we found that the genus of Bryobacter, Sphingobium and Luteibacter enriched in healthy samples soil may inhibit GRR. In conclusion, ironnitrogen coupling alters microbial communities, diversity and gene expression, impacting GRR occurrence. These findings provide a new perspective for understanding the formation mechanism of GRR based on the influence of iron and nitrogen cycle on microbial gene expression.

TI  - Calcium constrains plant control over forest ecosystem nitrogen cycling
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Forest ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling is a critical controller of the ability of forests to prevent the movement of reactive N to receiving waters and the atmosphere and to sequester elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Here we show that calcium (Ca) constrains the ability of northern hardwood forest trees to control the availability and loss of nitrogen. We evaluated soil N-cycling response to Ca additions in the presence and absence of plants and observed that when plants were present, Ca additions ``tightened'' the ecosystem N cycle, with decreases in inorganic N levels, potential net N mineralization rates, microbial biomass N content, and denitrification potential. In the absence of plants, Ca additions induced marked increases in nitrification (the key process controlling ecosystem N losses) and inorganic N levels. The observed "tightening'' of the N cycle when Ca was added in the presence of plants suggests that the capacity of forests to absorb elevated levels of atmospheric N and CO2 is fundamentally constrained by base cations, which have been depleted in many areas of the globe by acid rain and forest harvesting.

TI  - Asymmetric responses of soil bacterial community and soil respiration to precipitation changes: A global meta-analysis
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Changes in the frequency and intensity of precipitation altered the hydrological features, thereafter greatly affecting carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Soil bacteria are pivotal drivers of the global C cycle in terrestrial ecosystems; however, the responses of soil bacterial communities and the C-cycle they regulated to precipitation changes remain unclear. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis using 98 paired observations from 58 studies to explore the responses of soil bacteria (abundance and diversity) and their C-related functions (soil respiration) to increased/decreased precipitation. We found that the response of soil bacterial abundance was linearly correlated with precipitation changes, while the response of soil respiration was negatively asymmetric (concave-down). The relationship among soil bacterial abundance, alpha diversity, and soil respiration was weakened by decreased precipitation, indicating that decreased precipitation exhibited a stronger effect on soil bacterial community and soil respiration. Our study extends the understanding of soil bacteria and their functions in response to precipitation change and facilitates the prediction of soil carbon cycle-related functions by using soil microorganisms in terrestrial ecosystem models under future precipitation scenarios.

TI  - Soil Microbial Legacy Overrides the Responses of a Dominant Grass and Nitrogen-Cycling Functional Microbes in Grassland Soil to Nitrogen Addition
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Both atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition and soil microbial legacy (SML) can affect plant performance, the activity of soil N-cycling functional microbes and the relative abundance of N-cycling functional genes (NCFGs). In the grassland vegetation successional process, how the interaction of SML and N deposition affects the performance of dominant grass and NCFGs remains unclear. Therefore, we planted Leymus chinensis, a dominant grass in the Songnen grassland, in the soil taken from the early, medium, late, and stable successional stages. We subjected the plants to soil sterilization and N addition treatments and measured the plant traits and NCFG abundances (i.e., nifH, AOB amoA, nirS, and nirK). Our results showed the biomass and ramet number of L. chinensis in sterilized soil were significantly higher than those in non-sterilized soil, indicating that SML negatively affects the growth of L. chinensis. However, N addition increased the plant biomass and the AOB amoA gene abundance only in sterilized soils, implying that SML overrode the N addition effects because SML buffered the effects of increasing soil N availability on NCFGs. Therefore, we emphasize the potential role of SML in assessing the effects of N deposition on dominant plant performance and NCFGs in the grassland vegetation succession.

TI  - pH-tailored monodispersed nanopolystyrene: environmental impact on PGPR and nitrogen cycling in agricultural soils
T2  - GREEN CHEMISTRY LETTERS AND REVIEWS
AB  - Emulsion polymerization was optimized to synthesize polystyrene nanoparticles (NPSt) with tailored sizes by adjusting pH and azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) content. An NPSt sample prepared with 20 mg AIBN at pH 8 showed the smallest size (88 nm) and narrowest distribution (24 nm peak width). XRD patterns indicated semi-crystalline nature for this optimized sample. The involvement of synthesized NPSt in the nitrogen (N) cycle enhanced our understanding of nitrogen transformations and the response of microbial populations to polystyrene nanoparticles in the environment. In vitro experiments revealed compatibility of NPSt with tested PGPR strains, with no inhibition zones observed. Furthermore, carrot growth in soil containing 400 mg/kg NPSt showed no significant changes in biomass or shoot height compared to control soil. This demonstrates the NPSt samples had no negative effects on PGPR or soil nitrogen transformations and bacterial communities. Overall, the study optimized the synthesis of NPSt, evaluated environmental impacts on soil nitrogen cycling and PGPR, and found no toxicity of NPSt on PGPR or carrot growth up to 400 mg/kg concentration. The insights contribute to understanding nanomaterial interactions in agricultural systems, highlighting the need to consider the environmental impacts of nanoparticles.

TI  - Specificity of soil properties in the rhizosphere: Analysis of literature data
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - An analysis of literature is given on the following problems: a concept of the rhizosphere and its boundaries, a notion of border cells, the composition and the role of root exudates, the role of ectomycorrhyzal fungi and the biological activity of soils in the rhizosphere, and the specificity of some chemical and physical properties of soils in the rhizosphere. The soil of the rhizosphere is shown to differ significantly from the surrounding soil in most characteristics concerning both the composition of the solid phase and soil solution and the function of individual components of the soil system. The rhizosphere soil has a great number of microorganisms and they have high diversity. The most important specific features of soils in the rhizosphere are related to a continuous input of root exudates, metabolic products of microorganisms and border cells. The presence of these diverse substances leads to significant changes in the cycles of chemical elements, intensification of the carbon cycle, weathering, and decomposition of organic matter. Some compounds composed root exudates, which promote the microbial synthesis of ethylene-a signal controlling the development of plants-and can cause chemotaxis.

TI  - Effect of microplastics on carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycle in farmland soil: A meta-analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Farmland soil is a major sink for microplastics (MPs). Despite recognized potential impacts on soil ecosystems, comprehensive assessments of MPs' effects on carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling in agricultural soils are limited. Data from 102 peer-reviewed studies were analyzed to elucidate the effects of MPs exposure on the C, N, and P cycles in soil. Results showed increased concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and microbial biomass nitrogen, accompanied by elevated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) after MPs introduction. A random forest model revealed that soil C, N, and P cycles are driven by MPs characteristics (biodegradability, size, concentration), soil properties (initial pH, SOC, total N, clay content), and experimental conditions (incubation period, soil moisture). Complex interactions between MPs and soil C, N, and P were illustrated, with increased CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions due to C mineralization and enhanced denitrification rates caused by MPs. These negative effects imply a need for strengthened management of C, N, and P cycles in agricultural soil to reduce farmland ecosystems' contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Distribution of bacteria and nitrogen-cycling microbial communities along constructed Technosol depth-profiles
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Technosol construction through assemblage of treated soil and recycled wastes is an innovative option for the restoration of degraded lands and re-use of industrial wastes. Recent studies have evidenced that Technosols could support soil functions such as primary production but the knowledge about other ecosystemic services, such as nutrient cycling, is limited. We investigated how the total bacterial community and key functional microbial communities involved in nitrogen cycling were influenced by the depth and type of Technosol. We found that despite being artificially constructed, Technosols exhibited a gradual change in microbial activity and abundance along the soil profile. Both nitrification and denitrification rates decreased with increasing depth as previously observed in other soil systems. Potential denitrification and nitrification were correlated with Technosol physico-chemical properties but also with abundances of nirS denitrifiers and bacterial amoA gene, respectively. The correlation between nitrification rates and bacterial ammonia-oxidizers suggests that bacteria are driving nitrification in Technosols. A-RISA fingerprints showed a distinct community structure along different Technosol layers. Technosol properties affected denitrification strongly than nitrification underlining the importance of better understanding the microbial communities in Technosols to maximize their potential for nutrient cycling, an essential ecosystem function.

TI  - Increased nitrogen cycling facilitates native forest regeneration: Potential for restoring extinct ecological processes?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Ecological processes often maintain the plant communities with which they have a long evolutionary association, and so their loss may favor invasions by nonnative species. We simulated the effects of fecal deposition and soil turnover by the extinct avian megafauna of New Zealand to test their influence on woody plant regeneration and nonnative plant invasion in a cool temperate rain forest. Hen manure increased soil available NO3 , leading to greater seedling regeneration relative to control plots. Although soil P was elevated within plots treated with hen manure, concentrations also increased within plots treated with liquid fertilizer, which did not have different seedling densities relative to controls. Simulated avian soil disturbance did not increase seedling densities, and none of the three treatments affected the proportion of woody seedlings that were nonnative. However, pretreatment variation in NO3- availability, which reflected longer-term rates of nitrogen cycling, reduced community invasibility. Our findings suggest that avian-derived nitrogen inputs increase the regeneration of native forests, raising the question of whether the functional role of extinct megaherbivores is absent in New Zealand.

TI  - Impact of functional microbes on nitrogen removal in artificial tidal wetlands in the Yangtze River estuary: Evidence from molecular and stable isotopic analyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - After decades of rapid development in the delta, the worsening water quality in the Yangtze River estuary has become a concern in China. To improve the situation, we explored the use of two tidal wetland mesocosms (PA and NP), by evaluating nitrogen removal performance, greenhouse gas emissions and underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results show the mesocosms removed similar to 23.9% of TN from nitrate-dominated river water (1.20 mg L-1), with PA twice effective as NP, which is consistent with the molecular and stable isotopic data. The emissions of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were low in the soil of both PA and NP, while integrated microbial analyses suggest nitrification was the major contributor of nitrite to anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and also the dominant ammonia removal pathway in the mesocosms, particularly PA. The simultaneous dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), anammox, denitrification and nitrification had mainly contributed to the nitrogen removal and greenhouse gas emission reduction, with rates of 0.86-2.05, 11.94-24.38, 44.95-340.95, and 458.56-1046.91 nmol N-2 g(-1) dry soil d(-1), respectively. This study would expand our understanding of the nitrogen-cycling in tidal wetlands, helping develop a sustainable solution to the water pollution problem in the Yangtze River estuary.

TI  - Substantial contribution of tree canopy nitrifiers to nitrogen fluxes in European forests
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB  - Human activities have greatly increased the reactive nitrogen in the biosphere, thus profoundly altering global nitrogen cycling. The large increase in nitrogen deposition over the past few decades has led to eutrophication in natural ecosystems, with negative effects on forest health and biodiversity. Recent studies, however, have reported oligotrophication in forest ecosystems, constraining their capacity as carbon sinks. Here we demonstrate the widespread biological transformation of atmospheric reactive nitrogen in the canopies of European forests by combining nitrogen deposition quantification with measurements of the stable isotopes in nitrate and molecular analyses across ten forests through August-October 2016. We estimate that up to 80% of the nitrate reaching the soil via throughfall was derived from canopy nitrification, equivalent to a flux of up to 5.76 kg N ha-1 yr-1. We also document the presence of autotrophic nitrifiers on foliar surfaces throughout European forests. Canopy nitrification thus consumes deposited ammonium and increases nitrate inputs to the soil. The results of this study highlight widespread canopy nitrification in European forests and its important contribution to forest nitrogen cycling.
   Canopy nitrification contributes up to 80% of the nitrate reaching the soils via throughfall in European forests, according to analyses of nitrogen deposition and oxygen isotopes in nitrate at ten forested sites.

TI  - Plant productivity is a key driver of soil respiration response to climate change in a nutrient-limited soil.
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Despite knowledge of the interaction between climate change factors significant uncertainty exists concerning the individual and interactive effects of elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) and elevated temperature (eT) on the soil microbiome and function. Here we examine the individual and interactive effects of eCO(2) and eT on tree growth, soil respiration (Rsoil), biomass, structural and functional composition of microbial community, nitrogen (N) mineralisation and N availability in a whole tree chamber experiment. Eucalyptus globulus plants were grown from seedling to ca. 10 m tall for 15 months in a nutrient-poor sandy soil under ambient and elevated (+ 240 ppm) atmospheric CO2 concentrations combined with ambient or elevated temperatures (+ 3 degrees C) in a full factorial design. Plant growth was strongly stimulated under eCO(2), but eT had little impact on any measured plant property. In contrast, Rsoil was not consistently affected by eCO(2) or eT, but correlated strongly with root and leaf biomass. The response of N-mineralisation and nutrient availability to eCO(2) and eT varied across time, and available N correlated strongly with plant height. Further, the C:N ratio of the microbial biomass and leaves were both higher under eCeT treatment. However, these functional measures were not significantly linked to either structural or functional diversity of the soil micro biome. Taken together, these results suggest that in this low-nutrient soil, belowground processes are principally driven by aboveground productivity. Our work provides novel insight into mechanisms underlying aboveand belowground response to climate change, and the potential to sequester C in a low-nutrient status soil under future climatic conditions may be limited .

TI  - Transformed biosolids promote ryegrass growth and microbial carbon cycling at the 'cost' of soil carbon
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil carbon supports desirable ecosystem functions for global agricultural productivity and climate resilience objectives. Wastewater biosolids can be transformed into soil amendments that return carbon and nutrients to agricultural systems in stoichiometric ratios that support carbon stabilisation. However, practicable delivery that enhances stable soil carbon and plant yield remains challenging. Soil carbon stability and nutrient availability are mediated partly by microbial community composition and function, which are poorly understood in soils amended with transformed biosolids. We conducted a 56-day study in a temperature-controlled glasshouse, growing perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) in pasture soil amended with straw, straw supplemented with nutrients, or transformed biosolids (composted biosolids, dried biosolids or biosolids biochar), all with equal added carbon (3500 kg ha(-1)). Control soils, with and without supplementary nutrients, were also included. Plant dry mass, soil chemical characteristics, and soil carbon fractions were measured at harvest. 16S rRNA sequencing was used to infer the composition and putative function of rhizosphere bacterial communities. Shoot dry mass increased for composted biosolids (236%) and dried biosolids (559%), but total carbon in rhizosphere soil decreased for composted biosolids (16.3%), dried biosolids (13.3%) and biosolids biochar (12.7%) when compared to unamended soils. Fine-fraction carbon in rhizosphere soil decreased for straw with supplementary nutrients (6.8%), dried biosolids (6.3%) and biosolids biochar (4.6%). Rhizosphere bacterial communities clustered by treatment, with populations correlated with fine-fraction carbon distinct from those populations correlated with shoot and root dry mass. Path analysis linked fine-fraction carbon loss with increased putative carbon cycling genes, driven by available nutrients and plant growth. Transformed biosolids can trigger a microbial response that reallocates nutrients from organic matter to plants, disrupting soil carbon-nutrient stoichiometry and facilitating carbon loss. Understanding the carbon cost of this ecosystem service is fundamental when translating benefits of transformed biosolids to end users.

TI  - Ecology and risks of the global plastisphere as a newly expanding microbial habitat
T2  - INNOVATION
AB  - Plastic offers a new niche for microorganisms, the plastisphere. The everincreasing emission of plastic waste makes it critical to understand the microbial ecology of the plastisphere and associated effects. Here, we present a global fingerprint of the plastisphere, analyzing samples collected from freshwater, seawater, and terrestrial ecosystems. The plastisphere assembles a distinct microbial community that has a clearly higher heterogeneity and a more deterministically dominated assembly compared to natural habitats. New coexistence patterns-loose and fragile networks with mostly specialist linkages among microorganisms that are rarely found in natural habitats-are seen in the plastisphere. Plastisphere microbiomes generally have a great potential to metabolize organic compounds, which could accelerate carbon turnover. Microorganisms involved in the nitrogen cycle are also altered in the plastisphere, especially in freshwater plastispheres, where a high abundance of denitrifiers may increase the release of nitrite (aquatic toxicant) and nitrous oxide (greenhouse gas). Enrichment of animal, plant, and human pathogens means that the plastisphere could become an increasingly mobile reservoir of harmful microorganisms. Our findings highlight that if the trajectory of plastic emissions is not reversed, the expanding plastisphere could pose critical planetary health challenges.

TI  - Global biogeographic distribution of Bathyarchaeota in paddy soils
T2  - MSYSTEMS
AB  - Bathyarchaeota, known as key participants of global elements cycling, is highly abundant and diverse in the sedimentary environments. Bathyarchaeota has been the research spotlight on sedimentary microbiology; however, its distribution in arable soils is far from understanding. Paddy soil is a habitat similar to freshwater sediments, while the distribution and composition of Bathyarchaeota in paddy soils have largely been overlooked. In this study, we collected 342 in situ paddy soil sequencing data worldwide to illuminate the distribution patterns of Bathyarchaeota and explore their potential ecological functions in paddy soils. The results showed that Bathyarchaeota is the dominant archaeal lineage, and Bathy-6 is the most predominant subgroup in paddy soils. Based on random forest analysis and construction of a multivariate regression tree, the mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are identified as the factors significantly influencing the abundance and composition of Bathyarchaeota in paddy soils. Bathy-6 was abundant in temperate environments, while other subgroups were more abundant in sites with higher rainfall. There are highly frequent associations between Bathyarchaeota and methanogens and ammonia-oxidizing archaea. The interactions between Bathyarchaeota and microorganisms involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism imply a potential syntrophy between these microorganisms, suggesting that members of Bathyarchaeota could be important participants of geochemical cycle in paddy soils. These results shed light on the ecological lifestyle of Bathyarchaeota in paddy soils, and provide some baseline for further understanding Bathyarchaeota in arable soils.
   IMPORTANCE Bathyarchaeota, the dominant archaeal lineage in sedimentary environments, has been the spotlight of microbial research due to its vital role in carbon cycling. Although Bathyarchaeota has been also detected in paddy soils worldwide, its distribution in this environment has not yet been investigated. In this study, we conducted a global scale meta-analysis and found that Bathyarchaeota is also the dominant archaeal lineage in paddy soils with significant regional abundance differences. Bathy-6 is the most predominant subgroup in paddy soils, which differs from sediments. Furthermore, Bathyarchaeota are highly associated with methanogens and ammonia-oxidizing archaea, suggesting that they may be involved in the carbon and nitrogen cycle in paddy soil. These interactions provide insight into the ecological functions of Bathyarchaeota in paddy soils, which will be the foundation of future studies regarding the geochemical cycle in arable soils and global climate change.

TI  - Impact of rainfall gradient on aboveground biomass and soil organic carbon dynamics of forest covers in Gujarat, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Alterations in precipitation are affecting forest ecosystems' soil carbon cycling. To understand how shifts in rainfall may alter these carbon pools, above-ground biomass (AGB), soil organic carbon (SOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) of tropical forest covers were measured across a rainfall gradient (543-1590 mm) in Gujarat (India), a state falling under semi arid to tropical dry-wet conditions. Species diversity, tree density and soil texture were also measured. Field visits and data collection were carried out for 2 years (2009-2011) in 95 plots of 250 x 250 m in the forest covers across four distinct rainfall zones (RFZs). Data analysis showed that differences seen in the values of the measured parameters across the RFZs are statistically significant (P < 0.05). Positive correlations were observed between mean annual precipitation (MAP) and tree density, species diversity, AGB, SOC, and MBC. Across the RFZs, AGB ranged between 0.09 and 168.28 Mg ha(-1); SOC values (up to 25 cm soil depth) varied between 2.94 and 147.84 Mg ha(-1). Soil texture and MBC showed a significant impact on the dynamics of SOC in all the RFZs. MBC is more influenced by SOC rather than AGB. Both vegetation type and MAP have an important role in the regulation of SOC in tropical soils. Together, these results reveal complex carbon cycle responses are likely to occur in tropical soils under altered rainfall regimes.

TI  - The magnitude and direction of priming were driven by soil moisture and temperature in a temperate forest soil of China
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - Increased temperature and extreme precipitation due to global climate change play a critical role in the soil carbon cycle. The priming effect describes the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) mineralization after fresh organic matter (FOM) inputs and is a major component of the soil carbon cycle. However, further research is needed to improve understanding of the interactive influence of warming and soil moisture changes on soil carbon priming. In this study, we conducted a 57-day incubation experiment to investigate the interactive effects of soil moisture and temperature on priming on forest soils from a temperate region of China. 13C labeled Glucose was added to simulate the priming effect induced by rhizosphere exudates at three soil moisture levels (20 %, 55 %, and 90 % of field capacity (FC)) and three temperature levels (5, 15, and 25 degrees C). Soil priming increased significantly with the increase of moisture; the cumulative priming effects were positive at 55 % and 90 % FC, but were negative at 20 % FC. Warming significantly stimulated the magnitude of priming at all moisture levels, with the greatest negative priming under 20 %FCx25 degrees C (-165.9 mg C kg-1) and the greatest positive priming under 90 %FCx25 degrees C (588.0 mg C kg- 1). Furthermore, priming considerably influenced the soil carbon balance, which resulted in maximum carbon storage under 20 %FCx25 degrees C (279.4 mg C kg- 1) and the greatest carbon loss under 90 %FCx25 degrees C (-493.9 mg C kg- 1). Furthermore, temperature sensitivity (Q10) of SOC mineralization was highly dependent on FOM inputs. In unprimed soils, Q10 was negatively and significantly related to moisture; however, no significant correlation was observed between Q10 and moisture after glucose addition because of the priming. The findings of this study contribute to the better understanding of the temperate forest soil carbon cycle under global climate change by highlighting the interactive effects of soil moisture and temperature on the priming effect.

TI  - Enzymatic stoichiometry reveals phosphorus limitation-induced changes in the soil bacterial communities and element cycling: Evidence from a long-term field experiment
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Soil microbial growth and activity are generally limited by availability of resources such carbon (C), nitrogen (N), or phosphorus (P) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, how soil microbial response to resource limitation in intensive agricultural ecosystems is unclear. Four treatments, namely no fertiliser (CK), chemical fertiliser (NPK), only N fertiliser (N), and organic fertiliser with chemical fertiliser (MNPK), were selected to investigate the effects of different fertiliser practices on the pattern and degree of the limitation of soil microorganisms by elemental availability. The enzyme stoichiometry results indicated that under CK, NPK, and N fertiliser treat-ments, the soil microbial community as a whole was limited by the availability of C and P. N fertiliser application alone (N) considerably increased the limitation degree of P availability by soil microorganisms, which was caused by the increase in soil N/P. The increased microbial P limitation significantly increased the relative abundance of copiotrophic taxa (Actinobacteria and Sphingomonas) that use labile carbonaceous compounds (such as starch), whereas it significantly decreased the relative abundance of oligotrophic taxa (Acidobacteria and RB41) that use recalcitrant carbonaceous compounds (such as lignin, pectin, and hemicellulose) and important ratios of the microbial community structure (the ratio of fungi/bacteria and the ratio of gram-positive/negative bacteria). Changes in the microbial community structure may be unfavourable for the increase in soil organic matter originating from microorganisms (such as fungi). As per the partial least squares path modelling, N and P cycling was directly affected by microbial P limitation. Linear regression analysis further indicated that with an increase in P limitation, the abundance of functional genes related to N cycling (N fixation, nitrification, and denitrification), P capture (phosphatase and 3-phytase), and P retention (polyphosphate kinase) increased significantly. These results revealed that microorganisms in a P-limited environment adjust their abundance of functional genes to absorb and retain insufficient element (P) while accelerating the turnover of the excess element (N). This study revealed the status and extent of the resource limitation for soil microbial utilization under different long-term fertilisation regimes and indicated that soil bacterial communities respond to resource limitation by adjusting their community structure and element cycling.

TI  - Effects of Plant and Soil Amendment on Remediation Performance and Methane Mitigation in Petroleum-Contaminated Soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Petroleum-contaminated soil is considered among the most important potential anthropogenic atmospheric methane sources. Additionally, various rhizoremediation factors can affect methane emissions by altering soil ecosystem carbon cycles. Nonetheless, greenhouse gas emissions from soil have not been given due importance as a potentially relevant parameter in rhizoremediation techniques. Therefore, in this study we sought to investigate the effects of different plant and soil amendments on both remediation efficiencies and methane emission characteristics in diesel-contaminated soil. An indoor pot experiment consisting of three plant treatments (control, maize, tall fescue) and two soil amendments (chemical nutrient, compost) was performed for 95 days. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal efficiency, dehydrogenase activity, and alkB (i.e., an alkane compound-degrading enzyme) gene abundance were the highest in the tall fescue and maize soil system amended with compost. Compost addition enhanced both the overall remediation efficiencies, as well as pmoA (i.e., a methane-oxidizing enzyme) gene abundance in soils. Moreover, the potential methane emission of diesel-contaminated soil was relatively low when maize was introduced to the soil system. After microbial community analysis, various TPH-degrading microorganisms (Nocardioides, Marinobacter, Immitisolibacter, Acinetobacter, Kocuria, Mycobacterium, Pseudomonas,Alcanivorax) and methane-oxidizing microorganisms (Methylocapsa, Methylosarcina) were observed in the rhizosphere soil. The effects of major rhizoremediation factors on soil remediation efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions discussed herein are expected to contribute to the development of sustainable biological remediation technologies in response to global climate change.

TI  - Litter Dynamics Regulate Population Densities in a Declining Terrestrial Herpetofauna
T2  - COPEIA
AB  - Loss of biodiversity within relatively pristine protected areas presents a major challenge for conservation. At La Selva Biological Station in the lowlands of Costa Rica, amphibians, reptiles, and understory birds have all declined over the past four decades, yet the factors contributing to these declines remain unclear. Here, we conduct two tests of the hypothesis that faunal declines are linked to shifting dynamics of leaf litter, a critical microhabitat for amphibians and reptiles and a major component of forest carbon cycles. First, we conduct a 16-month manipulation of leaf litter and measure response by terrestrial amphibians and reptiles. Second, we synthesize three year-long datasets collected over four decades to evaluate potential multi-decade change in standing litter depth. We show that litter depth regulates density of amphibians and reptiles, and that the strongest response to manipulations is in species that decline most rapidly based on long-term data. Our synthesis of litter depth data suggests considerable interannual variability in standing stocks of leaf litter with lowest quantity of leaf litter in the most recent sampling period. These tests are consistent with the hypothesis that these faunal declines may be in part driven by changes in forest litter dynamics, and ultimately to climate-sensitive carbon cycles.

TI  - The effect of moisture on soil microbial properties and nitrogen cyclers in Mediterranean sweet orange orchards under organic and inorganic fertilization
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Water shortage and soil degradation are common environmental stressors encountered in the Mediterranean area. We evaluated how different soil moisture levels, dependent on distance from drip irrigation points, impact on the biological, chemical and physical properties of citrus soil under organic and inorganic fertilization. We measured soil physicochemical properties, basal soil respiration, soil microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial community structure (phospholipid fatty acid assay), bacterial load (16S rRNA gene abundance), enzymatic activities (urease, dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase) and abundance of microbial nitrogen cyclers (quantitative PCR). A field experiment was established in an orange orchard (Citrus sinensis) in southeast Spain and eighteen soil samples were taken from each plot to compare the impacts of soil moisture: near (wet, w) or away (dry, d) from drip-irrigation points, in plots with inorganic fertilizers under intensive ploughing (PI) or organic fertilization (OA). The results showed that changes in microbial properties and soil microbial indexes were strongly associated with soil moisture content under both organic and inorganic fertilization, and with organic carbon content. Soil moisture influenced soil aggregation, basal soil respiration, phosphatase activity, bacterial and fungal load (PLFAs) and the abundances of bacterial N cycling genes, including nifH (nitrogen fixation) nirS/K and nosZ genes (denitrification) and amoA-B (bacterial nitrification). The potential for N fixation and denitrification, two microbial processes that are crucial for determining the amount of N in the soil, were improved by increased soil moisture in the proximity of the drip irrigation. Soil OC and total N, which are higher under organic fertilization than under inorganic fertilization, were also shown to be highly correlated with the abundance of the N cycling genes. By controlling irrigation doses and applying organic amendments, it may be possible to increase the microbial abundance and function in soil and support greater fertility of soils.

TI  - Effects of microplastics and excessive nitrogen pollution on oat growth and soil nitrogen cycling
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Both excessive nitrogen (N) and microplastic (MPs) pollution pose global change challenges to ecosystems and human health. The effects of MPs coexisting with excessive N on plant growth and N cycling are still largely unknown. This study employed a pot experiment to assess how polypropylene (PP) MPs influence oat (Avena sativa L.) growth and soil N cycling under conditions of excessive N fertilization. In the treatments of excessive N treatment, 2 % PP MPs significantly increased underground biomass (54.5 %). 15N stable isotope results showed that 2 % PP MPs treatment significantly reduced the percentage of N from fertilizer in oat by 10.4 %. Compared to without N treatment, excessive N treatment reduces the Shannon index of the rhizosphere soil bacterial community. Only at the 0.5 % PP MPs level, excessive N treatment significantly reduced the diversity of bacterial communities in the bulk soil compared to the without N treatment. The Shannon index of fungal community was not affected by N treatment and MPs. Microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) and pH were significant related to sensitive species in microbial communities. The coexistence of excess N and 2 % PP MPs significantly reduced the abundance of genes (norB, nosZ and nirB) related to denitrification process. Structural equation modeling showed that MPs could promote underground biomass, reduce soil pH, inorganic N content, and reduce N uptake efficiency, thus resisting growth damage caused by high N. In the future, the effects of different concentrations and types of MPs and different nitrogen forms on soil and crops should be further investigated.

TI  - Effects of Imazethapyr on Soybean Root Growth and Soil Microbial Communities in Sloped Fields
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The herbicide imazethapyr was previously recommended for controlling weeds in soybean fields. However, the effects of imazethapyr on soil microbial communities and their relationship with crop root growth in sloped soils remain unclear. In this study, a field experiment was conducted on a sloped field to explore the effects of imazethapyr on crop root growth, microbial communities, microbial co-occurrence networks, and the interactions between microbes and crop root growth. The field experiment included two factors: slope and imazethapyr. The slope factor included three different slope gradients: 5 degrees (S1), 10 degrees (S2), and 15 degrees (S3). The imazethapyr factor included two treatments: with (I1) and without (TO) imazethapyr. Thus, six total combinations of slope and imazethapyr treatments were tested in this study: S1I1, S2I1, S3I1, S1I0, S2I0, and S3I0. The results show that, compared to the IO treatments, the I1 treatments significantly increased the soybean root length, surface area, and volume by 11.7 similar to 26.5 m, 171.7 similar to 324.2 cm(2), and 1.8 similar to 3.1 cm(3), respectively, across all the slopes. The Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota bacterial phyla and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota fungal phyla were found to be the top phyla represented bacterial and fungal communities. These five phyla were scattered in co-occurrence networks of bacterial and fungal communities, suggesting these phyla play critical roles in enhancing the stability of co-occurrence networks. Compared to the IO treatments, the I1 treatments increased nodes from Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota phyla by 6.4%, 9.1%, and 11.2%, respectively, in the bacterial cooccurrence network. Similarly, in the fungal co-occurrence network, the I1 treatments improved nodes from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla by 1.8% and 5.8%, respectively. Compared to the IO treatments, the Ti treatments increased positive relations by 8.3% and 3.2%, respectively, in the bacterial and fungal co-occurrence networks. Moreover, the Ti treatments increased the relative abundance of root-promoting biomarkers and suppressed root-limiting biomarkers. However, the application of imazethapyr reduced the diversity and richness of bacterial and fungal communities in general. Furthermore, the nodes and links of bacterial co-occurrence networks in the IO treatments were 9.2% and 78.8% higher than these in the I1 treatments. Similarly, the I1 treatments also decreased 17.9% of fungal community links compared to the IO treatments. Our data also show that compared to the IO treatments, the Ti treatments decreased almost all gene families encoding nitrogen and carbon cycling pathways. In conclusion, the application of imazethapyr increased soybean root growth by increasing root-promoting biomarkers and improved the stability and cooperation of co-occurrence networks of bacterial and fungal communities. However, the application of imazethapyr had some negative impacts on microbial communities, such as reducing the diversity of bacterial and fungal communities and nitrogen and carbon cycling pathways.

TI  - Can plants build their niche through modulation of soil microbial activities linked with nitrogen cycling? A test with Arabidopsis thaliana
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - center dot In natural systems, different plant species have been shown to modulate specific nitrogen (N) cycling processes so as to meet their N demand, thereby potentially influencing their own niche. This phenomenon might go beyond plant interactions with symbiotic microorganisms and affect the much less explored plant interactions with free-living microorganisms involved in soil N cycling, such as nitrifiers and denitrifiers. center dot Here, we investigated variability in the modulation of soil nitrifying and denitrifying enzyme activities (NEA and DEA, respectively), and their ratio (NEA : DEA), across 193 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions. We studied the genetic and environmental determinants of such plant-soil interactions, and effects on plant biomass production in the next generation. center dot We found that NEA, DEA, and NEA : DEA varied c. 30-, 15- and 60-fold, respectively, among A. thaliana genotypes and were related to genes linked with stress response, flowering, and nitrate nutrition, as well as to soil parameters at the geographic origin of the analysed genotypes. Moreover, plant-mediated N cycling activities correlated with the aboveground biomass of next-generation plants in home vs away nonautoclaved soil, suggesting a transgenerational impact of soil biotic conditioning on plant performance. center dot Altogether, these findings suggest that nutrient-based plant niche construction may be much more widespread than previously thought.

TI  - Enhanced Release and Reactivity of Soil Water-Extractable Organic Matter Following Wildfire in a Subtropical Forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Climate-driven increases in wildfire frequency may disrupt soil carbon dynamics, potentially creating positive feedback within global carbon cycle. However, the release and lability of soil carbon following wildfire remain unclear, limiting our ability to predict fire impacts on carbon cycling. Here, we investigated chemical alterations in soil water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) following a subtropical forest wildfire by comparing burned soils to an adjacent unburned site. The consensus is that fire-altered DOM is aromatic and less reactive. However, we found that 10 months postfire, burned soils contained nearly three times more water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) than the control site. Reactomics analysis further revealed an overall 8-fold increase in potential reactivity of this carbon, identified by higher abundances of molecular formulas involved in identified microbial reaction pathways. Specifically, burned soils exhibited elevated potential oxidative enzyme reactions, linked to a higher nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) in WEOM. Metagenomic analysis revealed an enrichment of microbial taxa specialized in degrading aromatic compounds in burned areas, supporting the occurrence of potential microbial reaction pathways acting on WEOM in postfire soils. These findings highlight that wildfires may accelerate soil carbon loss through reactive WEOM mobilization and microbial response, with implications for long-term carbon-climate projections.

TI  - Saltmarsh sediments with wastewater input emit more carbon greenhouse gases but less N2O than mangrove sediments
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Wastewater discharge and salt marsh invasion are two main disturbances in global mangrove wetland ecosystems, but their combined effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remain unclear. Here, we performed a laboratory incubation experiment by adding wastewater (aquaculture and domestic wastewater) to mangrove and salt marsh sediments. Dissolved GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and environmental parameters were measured over a time series of 50 days. The nitrification and denitrification rates and corresponding functional gene abundances (AOA, AOB, nirS, and narG) were also quantified. The results show that wastewater addition significantly increased GHG emissions and global warming potential (GWP) in wetland sediments (p < 0.05 for both). Compared with mangroves, salt marsh sediments produced more carbon GHGs (CO2 and CH4) but less N2O after wastewater input. These different stimulatory effects could be explained by the nitrogen and carbon substrate availability, organic matter quality, and functional gene abundances in sediments. Assessing GHG emissions as CO2 equivalents, future scenarios of increasing salt marsh invasion with wastewater addition would increase the GWP caused by CO2 and CH4, decrease blue carbon sequestration potential in wetlands, and decrease the GWP caused by N2O and total GWP, indicating a great impact on global climate change and important implications for managing coastal wetlands.

TI  - Microbial responses to warming enhance soil carbon loss following translocation across a tropical forest elevation gradient
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Tropical soils contain huge carbon stocks, which climate warming is projected to reduce by stimulating organic matter decomposition, creating a positive feedback that will promote further warming. Models predict that the loss of carbon from warming soils will be mediated by microbial physiology, but no empirical data are available on the response of soil carbon and microbial physiology to warming in tropical forests, which dominate the terrestrial carbon cycle. Here we show that warming caused a considerable loss of soil carbon that was enhanced by associated changes in microbial physiology. By translocating soils across a 3000 m elevation gradient in tropical forest, equivalent to a temperature change of +/- 15 degrees C, we found that soil carbon declined over 5 years by 4% in response to each 1 degrees C increase in temperature. The total loss of carbon was related to its original quantity and lability, and was enhanced by changes in microbial physiology including increased microbial carbon-use-efficiency, shifts in community composition towards microbial taxa associated with warmer temperatures, and increased activity of hydrolytic enzymes. These findings suggest that microbial feedbacks will cause considerable loss of carbon from tropical forest soils in response to predicted climatic warming this century.

TI  - Soil Properties and Multi-Pollution Affect Taxonomic and Functional Bacterial Diversity in a Range of French Soils Displaying an Anthropisation Gradient
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The intensive industrial activities of the twentieth century have left behind highly contaminated wasteland soils. It is well known that soil parameters and the presence of pollutants shape microbial communities. But in such industrial waste sites, the soil multi-contamination with organic (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAH) and metallic (Zn, Pb, Cd) pollutants and long-term exposure may induce a selection pressure on microbial communities that may modify soil functioning. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of long-term multi-contamination and soil characteristics on bacterial taxonomic and functional diversity as related to the carbon cycle. We worked on 10 soils from northeast of France distributed into three groups (low anthropised controls, slag heaps, and settling ponds) based on their physico-chemical properties (texture, C, N) and pollution level. We assessed bacterial taxonomic diversity by 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing, and functional diversity using Biolog (R) and MicroResp microtiter plate tools. Although taxonomic diversity at the phylum level was not different among the soil groups, many operational taxonomic units were influenced by metal or PAH pollution, and by soil texture and total nitrogen content. Functional diversity was not influenced by PAH contamination while metal pollution selected microbial communities with reduced metabolic functional diversity but more tolerant to zinc. Limited microbial utilisation of carbon substrates in metal-polluted soils was mainly due to the nitrogen content. Based on these two observations, we hypothesised that reduced microbial activity and lower carbon cycle-related functional diversity may have contributed to the accumulation of organic matter in the soils that exhibited the highest levels of metal pollution.

TI  - Comparison of cryoconite organic matter composition from Arctic and Antarctic glaciers at the molecular-level
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
AB  - Glacier surfaces are reservoirs that contain organic and inorganic debris referred to as cryoconite. Solar heating of this material results in the formation of water-filled depressions that are colonized by a variety of microbes and are hypothesized to play a role in carbon cycling in glacier ecosystems. Recent studies on cryoconite deposits have focused on their contribution to carbon fluxes to determine whether they are a net source or sink for atmospheric CO2. To better understand carbon cycling in these unique ecosystems, the molecular constituents of cryoconite organic matter (COM) require further elucidation. COM samples from four glaciers were analyzed by targeted extraction of plant-and microbial-derived biomarkers in conjunction with non-targeted NMR experiments to determine the COM composition and potential sources. Several molecular proxies were applied to assess COM degradation and microbial activity using samples from Greenland, the Canadian Arctic, and Antarctica. COM from Canadian (John Evans glacier) and Greenlandic (Leverett glacier) locations was more chemically heterogeneous than that from the Antarctic likely due to inputs from higher plants, mosses and Sphagnum as suggested by the solvent-extractable alkyl lipids and sterols and the detection of lignin-and Sphagnum-derived phenols after cupric oxide chemolysis. Solid-state C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments highlighted the bulk chemical functional groups of COM allowing for a general assessment of its degradation stage from the alkyl/O-alkyl proxy whereas solution-state H-1 NMR highlighted both microbial and plant contributions to base-soluble extracts from these COM samples. The dominance of H-1 NMR signals from microbial protein/peptides in base-soluble extracts of COM from Antarctica (Joyce glacier and Garwood glacier), phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarker detection and the absence of plant-derived biomarkers in both the solvent and cupric oxide extracts suggests that this COM is dominated by microbial-derived material. These results indicate that COM carbon composition is dependent on the local glacier environment which may have a profound impact on carbon cycling and sequestration on glacier surfaces.

TI  - Impact of environmental factors on the diversity of nitrogen-removal bacteria in wetlands in the Sanmenxia Reservoir of the Yellow River
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - Purpose: The wetland in the Yellow River Reservoir area of Sanmenxia is a habitat of mute swans and an important water source conservation area. Excessive nitrogen input can directly or indirectly threaten the ecological health of the wetland. To date, no systematic studies have investigated the effects of vegetation or environmental factors on the microbial communities, especially nitrogen-removal bacteria in the wetland of the Sanmenxia Reservoir on the Yellow River. This study aimed to uncover the correlations between nitrogen-removal bacteria communities, vegetation type, and environmental physicochemical properties in the Yellow River wetlands, laying a foundation for future studies of nitrogen cycling. Methods: Sediment profile samples were collected and metagenomic sequencing was used to study the diversity and composition of microbial communities in wetland sediment. Nitrogen isotope tracing was performed to determine the denitrification and anammox rates. Results: The dominant microorganisms of the wetland samples were bacteria. Subsequently, the community composition and taxonomic abundances were analyzed at the phylum and genus levels, which showed significant differences between-groups (P < 0.01). Nitrogen removal occurred mainly through denitrification in YJW (a sampling site, maximum denitrification rate of 1.09 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)) and anammox in TEH (another sampling site, maximum anammox rate of 0.14 mg N kg(-1) day(-1)). The abundance of typical anammox and denitrifying bacteria at the genus level was generally consistent with reaction rates. The factors related to microbial community diversity on the genera included NH4+-N, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and pH, but NH4+-N was the key factor that explained the difference between YJW and TEH in terms of community structure of nitrogen-removal microbes. Three highly significant nitrogen-removal communities and five nitrogen metabolism functional genes were screened by Spearman rank correlation coefficient analysis. Conclusion: This study revealed the relationship between sediment microbial community structure, especially denitrification microorganisms, typical denitrification reaction processes, and environmental physicochemical properties in the Sanmenxia Yellow River Reservoir, which provides theoretical support for future studies on soil environmental nitrogen cycling mechanisms in this riverside wetland.

TI  - Geologic controls of soil carbon cycling and microbial dynamics in temperate conifer forests
T2  - CHEMICAL GEOLOGY
CP  - Annual Fall American-Geophysical-Union Meeting
AB  - Understanding soil carbon cycling is important for assessing ecosystem response to climate change. Temperate conifer forest soils contain a substantial portion of the global soil C pool and therefore are key components of the global carbon cycle. Despite the importance of temperate forest soil organic carbon (SOC) in the global carbon cycle, the mechanisms and dynamics of SOC accumulation and storage remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled four soils over different bedrock types (rhyolite, granite, basalt, limestone) under Pinus ponderosa to explore the following questions: i) Within a specific ecosystem type, how do SOC contents vary among sites with differing mineralogy? ii) What physicochemical variables are most highly correlated with SOC content, soil microbial community composition and soil respiration? and iii) What mechanisms account for the influence of these variables on SOC cycling? Soil physiochemical and microbiological properties were characterized and compared on the basis of mineral assemblage, pH, organic carbon content, bacterial community composition, respiration rate, microbial biomass, specific metabolic activity (qCO(2)), and delta C-13 of respired CO2. The selected field sites spanned a physicochemical gradient, ranging from acid (pH of 5.2) to basic (pH of 7.1) from rhyolite to granite to basalt to limestone. The acidic rhyolite and granite soils had measurable amounts of exchangeable Al3+ (Up to 3 cmol(+) kg(-1)). SOC content varied significantly among sites, ranging from 3.5 to 11 kg C m(-2).in limestone and rhyolite soils, respectively. Soil bacterial communities were also significantly different among all sites. Metal-humus complex and Fe-oxyhydroxide content emerged as important controllers of SOC dynamics across all sites, showing significant correlation with both SOC content (Al-humus: R-2 = 0.71; P<0.01; Fehumus: R-2 = 0.75; P<0.001; crystalline FeOx: R-2 = 0.63; P<0.01) and bacterial community composition (Alhumus: R-2 = 0.35; P<0.05; Fe-humus: R-2 = 0.51; P<0.01; oxalate-extractable Fe: R-2 = 0.59; P<0.01). Moreover, soil pH was significantly correlated with exchangeable Al3+, metal-humus complex content, bacterial community composition, and microbial biomass C/N ratios. Results indicated that within a specific ecosystem, SOC dynamics and microbial community vary predictably with soil physicochemical variables directly related to mineralogical differences among soil parent materials. Specifically, the data suggest a gradient in the dominant SOC stabilization mechanism among sites, with chemical recalcitrance and metal-humus complexation the dominant control in soils of the acidic rhyolite and granite sites, and mineral adsorption the dominant factor in the basic limestone and basalt sites. Knowledge of parent material dependent SOC dynamics allows for improved estimates of ecosystem SOC stocks and the potential response of SOC to climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Topographic patterns of above- and belowground production and nitrogen cycling in Alpine tundra
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Topography controls snowpack accumulation and hence growing-season length, soil water availability, and the distribution of plant communities in the Colorado Front Range alpine. Nutrient cycles in such an environment are likely to be regulated by interactions between topographically determined climate and plant species composition. We investigated variation in plant and soil components of internal N cycling across topographic gradients of dry, moist, and wet alpine tundra meadows at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. We expected that plant production and N cycling would increase from dry to wet alpine tundra meadows, but we hypothesized that variation in N turnover would span a proportionately greater range than productivity, because of feedbacks between plants and soil microbial processes that determine N availability. Plant production of foliage and roots increased over topographic sequences from 280 g.m(-2).yr(-1) in dry meadows to 600 g.m(-2).yr(-1) in wet meadows and was significantly correlated to soil moisture. Contrary to our expectation, plant N uptake for production increased to a lesser degree, from 3.9 g N . m(-2).yr(-1) in dry meadows to 6.8 g N . m(-2).yr(-1) in wet meadows. In all communities, the belowground component accounted for the majority of biomass, production, and N use for production. Allocation belowground also differed among communities, accounting for 70% of total production and 80% of N use for production in dry meadows compared to 55% of production and 65% of N use for production in moist meadows. Variation in microbial processes was highly related to soil moisture, and we found very consistent relationships among microbial respiration, gross N mineralization, and N immobilization among communities. These results indicate that the topographic soil moisture gradient is in fundamental control of the patterns of N turnover among communities and that differences in plant species do not appear to be as important.

TI  - Increased mobilization of aged carbon to rivers by human disturbance
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB  - Approximately 8% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are estimated to come from land-use change(1), but this estimate excludes fluxes of terrestrial carbon to aquatic ecosystems from human disturbance. Carbon fluxes from land to rivers have probably increased by 0.1 to 0.2 petagrams of carbon per year as a result of disturbances such as deforestation, agricultural intensification and the injection of human wastewater(2). Most dissolved organic carbon in rivers originates from young organic carbon from soils and vegetation(3), but aged carbon removed from the modern carbon cycle is also exported in many systems. Here we analyse a global data set of radiocarbon ages of riverine dissolved organic carbon and spatial data on land cover, population and environmental variables. We find that the age of dissolved organic carbon in rivers increases with population density and the proportion of human-dominated landscapes within a watershed, and decreases with annual precipitation. We reason that disturbance reintroduces aged soil organic matter into the modern carbon cycle, although fossil carbon in fertilizer or petroleum products may also be a source of aged carbon in disturbed watersheds. The total export from the terrestrial environment to freshwater systems remains unknown; nevertheless, our results suggest that 3-9% of dissolved organic carbon in rivers is aged carbon mobilized by human disturbance.

TI  - Effects of Fishery Utilization on the Physicochemical Index and Microbial Community Composition in Saline-Alkaline Water
T2  - ACS OMEGA
AB  - Fishery utilization of idle saline-alkaline water resources offers various benefits including reducing surrounding soil salinity, improving the ecological environment, increasing arable land area, and providing economic advantages to the fishery industry. However, for decades, the characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of microbial communities that affect fishery utilization have not been clear, which restricts their application. In this study, high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was employed to analyze the bacterial community in these water resources. The sequencing yielded high-quality sequences (2,765,063), resulting in the identification of 18,761 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Analysis revealed that the type of saline-alkaline water had a more significant influence on the bacterial community compared to seasonal variations within the aquaculture period. The Chao index for saline-alkaline ponds (ASW) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than for still saline-alkaline water (SSW) and flowing saline-alkaline water (FSW), while the Shannon index for ASW was also significantly lower (P < 0.05) compared to FSW. When comparing ASW to nonaquaculture saline-alkaline water, a decrease in Proteobacteria to 26.87% was noted, particularly alpha-proteobacteria and gamma-proteobacteria, accompanied by a rapid increase in Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria to 28.60%. Networkx analysis further revealed that ASW significantly increased competition and amensalism from secondary saline-alkaline water microorganisms, resulting in a more solitary bacterial community composition as an adaptive strategy to cope with intense environmental pressures. Key bacterial species such as Pseudomonas, Hydrogenophaga, and Flavobacterium were found to be involved in hydrogen-cycling, nitrogen-cycling, and carbon-cycling, respectively, with all three exhibiting high abundance in FSW. Consequently, FSW demonstrates significant advantages in biogeochemical cycling, pollutant degradation, and the utilization of indigenous probiotic bacteria. Although the surface of abandoned secondary saline-alkaline land was covered with white salt particles, the fishery utilization of saline-alkaline water with low salinity levels (4.0-5.5), and the presence of nitrate and phosphate were identified as primary determinants of bacterial community composition. Nevertheless, a comparison of coastal high-salinity ponds indicated that salinity still selectively affects bacterial communities to some extent. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the microbial regulation of nitrite during saline-alkaline water aquaculture, thereby aiding in the efficient utilization of secondary saline-alkaline water resources for fisheries.

TI  - Preferential Flow Drives Coupled Nitrogen Migration and Transformation in the Vadose Zone: Microbial Hotspots and Functional Gene Dynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Preferential flow (Pf) in agricultural vadose zones poses environmental risks by accelerating transport of contaminants to groundwater while simultaneously functioning as biogeochemical hotspots. However, current research often simplifies vadose zone processes, overlooking the intricate coupling among pore structure, hydrological flow, and microbial communities in shaping nitrogen cycling. Field investigations in Northeast China identified significant differences between Pf zones and the soil matrix zones in terms of physical-chemical properties and molecular biological characteristics: Pf zones exhibited 26.4% higher organic/total nitrogen but 24.4-38.0% lower inorganic nitrogen species compared to matrix zones, along with an average 5.7-fold increase in nitrification gene abundance (amoABC and hao). High hydraulic gradients induced by Pf enhanced oxygen/nutrient transport, creating spatially heterogeneous redox gradients that restructured microbial communities. This interplay between hydrologic forcing and microbial activity established Pf zones as critical nitrogen transformation hotspots characterized by diverse functional potentials shaped by spatially variable environments. Our findings provide a mechanistic framework to refine nitrogen cycle models in the vadose zone and inform strategies to mitigate agricultural nitrogen loss through microbial metabolic control.

TI  - Changes in plant inputs alter soil carbon and microbial communities in forest ecosystems
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Global changes can alter plant inputs from both above- and belowground, which, thus, may differently affect soil carbon and microbial communities. However, the general patterns of how plant input changes affect them in forests remain unclear. By conducting a meta-analysis of 3193 observations from 166 experiments worldwide, we found that alterations in aboveground litter and/or root inputs had profound effects on soil carbon and microbial communities in forest ecosystems. Litter addition stimulated soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and microbial biomass, whereas removal of litter, roots or both (no inputs) decreased them. The increased SOC under litter addition suggested that aboveground litter inputs benefit SOC sequestration despite accelerated decomposition. Unlike root removal, litter alterations and no inputs altered particulate organic carbon, whereas all detrital treatments did not significantly change mineral-associated organic carbon. In addition, detrital treatments contrastingly altered soil microbial community, with litter addition or removal shifting it toward fungi, whereas root removal shifting it toward bacteria. Furthermore, the responses of soil carbon and microbial biomass to litter alterations positively correlated with litter input rate and total litter input, suggesting that litter input quantity is a critical controller of belowground processes. Taken together, these findings provide critical insights into understanding how altered plant productivity and allocation affects soil carbon cycling, microbial communities and functioning of forest ecosystems under global changes. Future studies can take full advantage of the existing plant detritus experiments and should focus on the relative roles of litter and roots in forming SOC and its fractions.

TI  - Simulating Global Terrestrial Carbon and Nitrogen Biogeochemical Cycles With Implicit and Explicit Representations of Soil Microbial Activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
AB  - Nutrient limitation is widespread in terrestrial ecosystems. Accordingly, representations of nitrogen (N) limitation in land models typically dampen rates of terrestrial carbon (C) accrual, compared with C-only simulations. These previous findings, however, rely on soil biogeochemical models that implicitly represent microbial activity and physiology. Here we present results from a biogeochemical model testbed that allows us to investigate how an explicit versus implicit representation of soil microbial activity, as represented in the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) soil biogeochemical models, respectively, influence plant productivity, and terrestrial C and N fluxes at initialization and over the historical period. When forced with common boundary conditions, larger soil C pools simulated by the MIMICS model reflect longer inferred soil organic matter (SOM) turnover times than those simulated by CASA. At steady state, terrestrial ecosystems experience greater N limitation when using the MIMICS-CN model, which also increases the inferred SOM turnover time. Over the historical period, however, warming-induced acceleration of SOM decomposition over high latitude ecosystems increases rates of N mineralization in MIMICS-CN. This reduces N limitation and results in faster rates of vegetation C accrual. Moreover, as SOM stoichiometry is an emergent property of MIMICS-CN, we highlight opportunities to deepen understanding of sources of persistent SOM and explore its potential sensitivity to environmental change. Our findings underscore the need to improve understanding and representation of plant and microbial resource allocation and competition in land models that represent coupled biogeochemical cycles under global change scenarios.
   Nitrogen limitation of terrestrial ecosystems is common, and crates feedbacks between aboveground and belowground biogeochemical cycles. We present a novel analysis looking at how the explicit versus implicit representation of soil microbial activity influences ecosystem carbon and nitrogen fluxes in a global biogeochemical model. With the microbial explicit model, MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization-carbon-nitrogen, we found increases in the inferred turnover time of soil organic matter (SOM) that were caused by plant-soil feedbacks from nitrogen limitation of plant productivity. Over the historical period, we found that warming-induced acceleration of SOM decomposition resulted in higher rates of nitrogen mineralization and vegetation biomass accrual. Collectively, these findings present new opportunities to investigate plant-soil interactions with a model that explicitly represents microbial decomposers.
   We present a global scale soil carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical model that explicitly represents soil microbial activity, MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization-carbon-nitrogen (MIMICS-CN) Nitrogen limitation of plant productivity increases soil organic matter turnover time with MIMICS-CN Soil texture and litter quality affect prognostic soil carbon to nitrogen ratios that are simulated with MIMICS-CN

TI  - The diversity of the N2O reducers matters for the N2O:N2 denitrification end-product ratio across an annual and a perennial cropping system
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Agriculture is the main source of terrestrial emissions of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas and the main cause of ozone layer depletion. The reduction of N2O into N-2 by microorganisms carrying the nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ) is the only biological process known to eliminate this greenhouse gas. Recent studies showed that a previously unknown clade of N2O-reducers was related to the capacity of the soil to act as an N2O sink, opening the way for new strategies to mitigate emissions. Here, we investigated whether the agricultural practices could differently influence the two N2O reducer clades with consequences for denitrification end-products. The abundance of N2O-reducers and producers was quantified by real-time PCR, and the diversity of both nosZ clades was determined by 454 pyrosequencing. Potential N2O production and potential denitrification activity were used to calculate the denitrification gaseous end-product ratio. Overall, the results showed limited differences between management practices but there were significant differences between cropping systems in both the abundance and structure of the nosZII community, as well as in the [rN(2)O/r(N2O+N-2)] ratio. More limited differences were observed in the nosZI community, suggesting that the newly identified nosZII clade is more sensitive than nosZI to environmental changes. Potential denitrification activity and potential N2O production were explained mainly by the soil properties while the diversity of the nosZII clade on its own explained 26% of the denitrification end-product ratio, which highlights the importance of understanding the ecology of this newly identified clade of N2O reducers for mitigation strategies.

TI  - The Reorganization of Rice Rhizosphere Microbial Communities Driven by Nitrogen Utilization Efficiency and the Regulatory Mechanism of Soil Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in rice cultivation is a key determinant of sustainable agriculture, yet the interaction between NUE and the dynamics of rhizosphere soil microbial communities remain poorly understood. In this study, the changes in rhizosphere soil microbial community composition and function due to NUE were analyzed in six rice genotypes across six treatments. Through 16S rRNA/ITS amplicon sequencing, it was found that rice with different NUEs reshaped the rhizosphere soil microbial community structure, but did not significantly alter the alpha-diversity of the bacterial community. There was a notable difference in the average abundance of the fungus Arnium in the rhizosphere soil of high-NUE rice compared to low-NUE rice, with a 222.2% increase in the former. Correlation analysis indicated that in high-NUE rice, soil nitrate and nitrite contents drove changes in the fungal community, while in low-NUE rice, soil water-soluble nitrogen and total potassium contents were the key influencing factors for changes in the fungal and nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities, respectively. The findings of this study demonstrate a link between NUE-induced changes in the rhizosphere soil microbiome and nitrogen cycling in rice, providing a basis for targeted nitrogen fertilizer management approaches guided by microbial control.

To understandhow plants regulate N2O emissions from enrofloxacin (ENR)-contaminated soils, in situ N2O emissions were measured in potexperiments with cherry radish and pakchoi. Gross N2Oproduction and consumption processes were discriminated basedon an acetylene inhibition experiment. Results indicated thatvegetable growth decreased the cumulative N2Oflux from 0.71 to-0.29 kg ha-1and mitigated the ENR-induced increase in N2Oemissions. Radish displayed better mitigation of N2O emissionsthan pakchoi. By combining the analysis of N2Oflux with soilphysicochemical and microbiological properties, we demonstrated that growing vegetables could either promote gross N2Oconsumption or decrease gross N2O production, primarily by interacting with soil nitrate, clade IInosZ(nosZII)-carrying bacteria,andDeinococcus-Thermus. ENR inhibited N2O consumption more than N2O production, with thenosZII-carrying bacteria,represented byGemmatimonadetes, as the main inhibition target. However, increasingnosZII-carrying bacteria by growing radishoffsets the inhibitory effect of ENR. Thesefindings provide new insights into N2O emissions and antibiotic pollution in vegetable-soil ecosystems and broaden the options for mitigating N2O emissions.

TI  - Rhizosphere enzyme activities and microorganisms drive the transformation of organic and inorganic carbon in saline-alkali soil region
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Western Jilin Province is one of the world's three major saline-alkali land distribution areas, and is also an important area of global climate change and carbon cycle research. Rhizosphere soil microorganisms and enzymes are the most active components in soil, which are closely related to soil carbon cycle and can reflect soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics sensitively. Soil inorganic carbon (SIC) is the main existing form of soil carbon pool in arid saline-alkali land, and its quantity distribution affects the pattern of soil carbon accumulation and storage. Previous studies mostly focus on SOC, and pay little attention to SIC. Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing technology was used to reveal the changes of community structure in three maize fields (M1, M2 and M3) and three rice fields (R1, R2 and R3), which were affected by different levels of salinization during soil development. It is a new research topic of soil carbon cycle in saline-alkali soil region to investigate the effects of soil microorganisms and soil enzymes on the transformation of SOC and SIC in the rhizosphere. The results showed that the root-soil-microorganism interaction was changed by saline-alkali stress. The activities of catalase, invertase, amylase and beta-glucosidase decreased with increasing salinity. At the phylum level, most bacterial abundance decreases with increasing salinity. However, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in maize field and Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Nitrospirae in rice field increased sharply under saline-alkali stress. The results of redundancy analysis showed that the differences of rhizosphere soil between the three maize and three rice fields were mainly affected by ESP, pH and soil salt content. In saline-alkali soil region, beta-glucosidase activity and amylase were significantly positively correlated with SOC content in maize fields, while catalase and beta-glucosidase were significantly positively correlated with SOC content in rice fields. Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia had significant positive effects on SOC content of maize and rice fields. Proteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes and Nitrospirae were positively correlated with SIC content. These enzymes and microorganisms are beneficial to soil carbon sequestration in saline-alkali soils.

TI  - Enriched Molecular-Level View of Saline Wetland Soil Carbon by Sensitivity-Enhanced Solid-State NMR
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a major role in mitigating greenhouse gas emission and regulating earth's climate, carbon cycle, and biodiversity. Wetland soils account for one-third of all SOM; however, globally, coastal wetland soils are eroding faster due to increasing sea-level rise. Our understanding of carbon sequestration dynamics in wetlands lags behind that of upland soils. Here, we employ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) to investigate the molecular-level structure of biopolymers in wetland soils spanning 11 centuries. High-resolution multidimensional spectra, enabled by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), demonstrate enduring preservation of molecular structures within herbaceous plant cores, notably condensing aromatic motifs and carbohydrates, even over a millennium, with the preserved cores constituting a decreasing minority among molecules from decomposition and repolymerization with depth and age. Such preserved cores occur alongside molecules from the decomposition of loosely packed parent biopolymers. These findings emphasize the relative vulnerability of coastal wetland SOM when exposed to oxygenated water due to geological and anthropogenic changes.

TI  - Dissimilatory Nitrate Reduction to Ammonium and Responsible Microbes in Japanese Rice Paddy Soil
T2  - MICROBES AND ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Nitrification-denitrification processes in the nitrogen cycle have been extensively examined in rice paddy soils. Nitrate is generally depleted in the reduced soil layer below the thin oxidized layer at the surface, and this may be attributed to high denitrification activity. In the present study, we investigated dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), which competes with denitrification for nitrate, in order to challenge the conventional view of nitrogen cycling in paddy soils. We performed paddy soil microcosm experiments using N-15 tracer analyses to assess DNRA and denitrification rates and conducted clone library analyses of transcripts of nitrite reductase genes (nrfA, nirS, and nirK) in order to identify the microbial populations carrying out these processes. The results obtained showed that DNRA occurred to a similar extent to denitrification and appeared to be enhanced by a nitrate limitation relative to organic carbon. We also demonstrated that different microbial taxa were responsible for these distinct processes. Based on these results and previous field observations, nitrate produced by nitrification within the surface oxidized layer may be reduced not only to gaseous N-2 via denitrification, but also to NH4+ via DNRA, within the reduced layer. The present results also indicate that DNRA reduces N loss through denitrification and nitrate leaching and provides ammonium to rice roots in rice paddy fields.

TI  - Aromatic compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline coordinates nitrogen assimilation and methane mitigation in fragrant rice
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
AB  - Rice paddy has been the main source of anthropogenic methane (CH4) 4 ) emissions, with significant variations among rice varieties. 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) is the key component of the pleasant aroma in fragrant rice. Here, we show that fragrant rice is metabolically active in nitrogen assimilation and exhibits high levels of 2-AP and that CH4 4 fluxes at the booting stage and cumulative emissions are 25.5% and 14.8% lower, respectively, in fragrant rice paddies compared with nonfragrant rice paddies. Three precursors involved in 2-AP synthesis- proline, glutamic acid, and ornithine-are identified as crucial nitrogen compounds that significantly promote CH4 4 oxidation in the rhizosphere. Augmenting 2-AP synthesis, either through foliar spraying or by utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 technology to generate knockout lines of BETAINE ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE 2 gene, effectively enhances CH4 4 oxidation and reduces CH4 4 fluxes. Our findings reveal that the 2-AP metabolic pathway coordinates the carbon/nitrogen cycle to improve nitrogen assimilation along with high 2-AP levels and mitigate CH4 4 emissions in paddy ecosystems.

TI  - Millennial-age glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in forested mineral soils: 14C-based evidence for stabilization of microbial necromass
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Understanding controls on the persistence of soil organic matter (SOM) is essential to constrain its role in the carbon cycle and inform climate-carbon cycle model predictions. Emerging concepts regarding the formation and turnover of SOM imply that it is mainly comprised of mineral-stabilized microbial products and residues; however, direct evidence in support of this concept remains limited. Here, we introduce and test a method for the isolation of isoprenoid and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) - diagnostic membrane lipids of archaea and bacteria, respectively - for subsequent natural abundance radiocarbon analysis. The method is applied to depth profiles from two Swiss pre-Alpine forested soils. We find that the Delta C-14 values of these microbial markers markedly decrease with increasing soil depth, indicating turnover times of millennia in mineral subsoils. The contrasting metabolisms of the GDGT-producing microorganisms indicates it is unlikely that the low Delta C-14 values of these membrane lipids reflect heterotrophic acquisition of C-14-depleted carbon. We therefore attribute the C-14-depleted signatures of GDGTs to their physical protection through association with mineral surfaces. These findings thus provide strong evidence for the presence of stabilized microbial necromass in forested mineral soils.

TI  - Enzyme activity, microbial biomass and community structure in a long-term restored soil under semi-arid conditions
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Our aim was to evaluate the long-term influences of urban organic amendments on the enzymes involved in the carbon cycle under semi-arid conditions, including changes in the biomass and structure of the microbial community. A soil was restored 24 years ago with an organic amendment based on domestic organic waste. Organic amendment was applied to soil in order to increase the content of total organic carbon (TOC) by 0.5% and 1.5% with respect to the original TOC content. Enzyme isoform composition was studied by using zymographic techniques based on protein extraction, separation by gel electrophoresis and further enzyme-specific, in-gel staining. Total cellulose and -glucosidase activities, microbial biomass estimated by phospholipid-fatty acid analysis and the number of isoforms of each enzyme showed increases related to the initial amount of organic amendment and the consequent development of vegetation. The information obtained by enzyme activity assays may be improved by the use of zymographic techniques, which allow the investigation of the variety of isoforms of each enzyme. This information could improve the understanding of the relationship between the microbial community and carbon cycling in restored areas.

TI  - Continental-scale measurements of soil pyrogenic carbon in Europe
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Pyrogenic carbon (PyC), the product of incomplete biomass combustion, is a key component of soil organic carbon (SOC) because it can persist in soils for centuries to millennia. Quantifying PyC across large spatial scales remains a significant challenge in constraining the global carbon cycle. We measured PyC in topsoils across Europe using molecular marker (benzene polycarboxylic acids, BPCA) and spectroscopic techniques (Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy, DRIFTS). We developed a calibration between BPCA and DRIFTS, but the calibration was less reliable (Y-variance explained = 0.62) than previous reports due to low soil PyC content and heterogeneity of soil matrices. Thus, we performed multiple regressions to identify drivers of PyC distribution using only the measured BPCA data. PyC content varied widely among soils, contributing 0-24% of SOC. Organic carbon was the strongest predictor of soil PyC content, but mean annual temperature, clay, and cation exchange capacity also emerged as predictors. PyC contributes a smaller proportion of SOC in European soils compared to other geographic regions. Comparing soil PyC measurements to PyC production rates in high latitude and Mediterranean regions suggests that transport, degradation, and recombustion are important mechanisms regulating soil PyC accumulation.

TI  - A model of greenhouse gas emissions from the management of turf on two golf courses
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - An estimated 32,000 golf courses worldwide (approximately 25,600 km(2)), provide ecosystem goods and services and support an industry contributing over $124 billion globally. Golf courses can impact positively on local biodiversity however their role in the global carbon cycle is not clearly understood. To explore this relationship, the balance between plant-soil system sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions from turf management on golf courses was modelled. Input data were derived from published studies of emissions from agriculture and turfgrass management. Two UK case studies of golf course type were used, a Links course (coastal, medium intensity management, within coastal dune grasses) and a Parkland course (inland, high intensity management, within woodland).
   Playing surfaces of both golf courses were marginal net sources of greenhouse gas emissions due to maintenance (Links 0.4 +/- 0.1 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1); Parkland 0.7 +/- 0.2 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1)y(-1)). A significant proportion of emissions were from the use of nitrogen fertiliser, especially on tees and greens such that 3% of the golf course area contributed 16% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The area of trees on a golf course was important in determining whole-course emission balance. On the Parkland course, emissions from maintenance were offset by sequestration from trees which comprised 48% of total area, resulting in a net balance of -4.3 +/- 0.9 Mg CO2e ha(-1)y(-1). On the Links course, the proportion of trees was much lower (2%) and sequestration from links grassland resulted in a net balance of 0.0 +/- 0.2 Mg CO2e ha(-1)y(-1). Recommendations for golf course management and design include the reduction of nitrogen fertiliser, improved operational efficiency when mowing, the inclusion of appropriate tree-planting and the scaling of component areas to maximise golf course sequestration capacity. The findings are transferrable to the management and design of urban parks and gardens, which range between fairways and greens in intensity of management. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Regulatory effects of nano-carbon on poplar growth and rhizosphere soil organic carbon accumulation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - The positive effects of nano-carbon on plant growth and soil C sequestration within the rhizosphere have been widely recognized. Nevertheless, information is seriously deficient in understanding the underlying mechanisms based on microbial communities and carbon cycle functional genes. Here, metagenomic sequencing was employed to explore different responses of poplar seedling growth and organic carbon fractions to nano-carbon fertilizers at concentrations of 0 ml/kg (CK), 5 ml/kg (NC-5), 10 ml/kg (NC-10) and 20 ml/kg (NC-20). We observed that, after 120 days of nano-carbon fertilizers treatments, the growth indexes (height and biomass) of poplar were significantly increased by 37.83-173.13 %, and C fractions in the rhizosphere soil were significantly increased by 1.64-8.16 % with the NC-5 treatment having a greater impact on organic carbon components than the NC-10 and NC-20 treatments. Compared to CK, the additions of nano-carbon fertilizers significantly increased the content of total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NN), and available potassium (AK) in the rhizosphere soil and decreased the pH, and improved stochastic processes in microbial communities, which elevates the abundance of microbes involved in carbon fixation (e.g., Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria) and carbon-cycling genes. In addition, network complexity and stability of microbes were significantly enhanced by nano-carbon treatments. Structural equation model indicated that microbial community assembly processes directly alter rhizosphere SOC accumulation. Carbon functional genes influenced by microbial structure have positive effects on biomass of poplar and SOC contents. Our observations provide key evidence for evaluating how nano-carbon fertilizers may influence functional changes in C cycle that are mediated by microbial synergy.

TI  - Impacts of Naphthenic Acids (NAs) Exposure on Soil Bacterial Community and Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) Dissemination
T2  - CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Naphthenic acids (NAs) are indigenous and complex components in petroleum. In the context of increasing global energy demand, the increasing extraction of fossil resources leads to increased environmental release of NAs, resulting in various environmental risks. However, the impact of NAs exposure on soil microorganisms remains still unclear. This study constructed a microcosm system to explore bacterial community structure and function, biological risk generation, and the mechanism of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) dissemination under NAs exposure. After 28 days of NAs stimulation, the denitrifying bacteria were enriched and the abundance of genes related to nitrogen cycle was up-regulated, enhancing nitrification and denitrification. Meanwhile, NAs stimulated the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as activated the glutathione antioxidant system. Furthermore, the cell metabolic, repair, and transfer regulatory pathways were enhanced under NAs exposure. The networks of ARGs with genera and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) indicated that NAs exposure promoted the enrichment of ARGs in hosts, the selective accumulation of MGEs, and the induction of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs. This study will provide valuable perspectives of interactions between NAs and its microecological environment, as well as ARGs transfer mechanisms.

TI  - Litter leachates transform soil bacterial composition enhancing nitrogen fixation in alpine meadow
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Litter leachates have the potential to considerably regulate biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet the effects of litter leachates on the soil microbial composition have so far not been adequately evaluated. Litter leachates of Elymus nutans, Kobresia setchwanensis, Ligularia virgaurea, were sprayed onto alpine meadow to assess their effects on community structure. Specific functional genes of soil bacteria were also analyzed to explore their potential ecological functions. Results indicate that application of litter leachates to alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau over three consecutive growing seasons, modifies plant communities and soil bacterial composition. Plant biomass, soil moisture, and C:N ratio of litter leachate treated soils were lower compared to the control, but soil microbial biomass carbon was greater. Increased plant and soil bacterial & alpha;-diversities were accompanied by alterations in soil physico-chemical properties and plant community structures, including higher soil bacterial & beta;-diversity. Soil moisture, organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, inorganic nitrogen, and C:N ratio being abiotic factors, were closely related to bacterial composition in the topsoil (0-20 cm), while plant biomass and diversity were the major biotic driving forces of soil bacterial composition in both topsoil and subsoil (20-40 cm). L. virgaurea litter leachate application increased soil nitrogen fixation potential, E. nutans and K. setchwanensis litter leachates reduced soil nitrification and denitrification however. These results indicate that litter leachates stimulate the nitrogen cycle in alpine meadow by altering bacterial composition and function of plants and soil bacteria. This ecologically significant contribution supports strategic application of litter leachates on alpine pasture.

TI  - High Abundance of Thaumarchaeota Found in Deep Metamorphic Subsurface in Eastern China
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Members of the Thaumarchaeota phylum play a key role in nitrogen cycling and are prevalent in a variety of environments including soil, sediment, and seawater. However, few studies have shown the presence of Thaumarchaeota in the terrestrial deep subsurface. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, this study presents evidence for the high relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota in a biofilm sample collected from the well of Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling at a depth of 2000 m. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship of these thaumarchaeotal sequences with known ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) isolates, suggesting the presence of AOA in the deep metamorphic environment of eastern China which is believed to be oxic. Based on fluid geochemistry and FAProTax functional prediction, a pathway of nitrogen cycling is proposed. Firstly, heterotrophic nitrogen fixation is executed by diazotrophic bacteria coupled with methane oxidation. Then, ammonia is oxidized to nitrite by AOA, and nitrite is further oxidized to nitrate by bacteria within the phylum Nitrospirae. Denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation occur slowly, leading to nitrate accumulation in the subsurface. With respect to biogeochemistry, the reaction between downward diffusing O-2 and upward diffusing CH4 potentially fuels the ecosystem with a high relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota.

TI  - N2O Concentration and Nitrogen-Cycling Functional Genes as Affected by Alternate Wetting and Drying Irrigation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Purpose: Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) mode can increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions compared to continuous flooding irrigation (CF). However, existing studies predominantly measured the emission flux, which is insufficient to elucidate the effects of AWD mode on N2O production and nitrogen transformation processes across soil profiles. Methods: Two rhizobox experiments employing in situ multi-layer sampling devices were conducted to simultaneously monitor N2O concentrations, soil physicochemical properties and nitrogen-cycling functional genes at the three soil depths (0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm) throughout the entire growth stage of double-cropping rice (Oryza sativa L.). Results: Compared to CF mode, AWD mode significantly enhanced the cumulative N2O emissions (by 10.48 times for late-season rice and 14.66 times in early-season rice) and the abundances of elevated N-cycling functional gene. The wetting-drying cycles in AWD mode reduced soil water content while increasing oxygen content, thereby stimulating both soil nitrification and nitrate leaching into the 10-20 cm soil layer. Subsequent re-flooding triggered anaerobic conditions, markedly amplifying denitrification activity, resulting in peak N2O concentration (315.74-352.37 mu L<middle dot>L- 1) and emission flux (360.60-380.34 mu g<middle dot>m(- 2)<middle dot>h(- 1)) in the 10-20 cm soil layer during milking stage. The partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) revealed stronger correlations between soil N2O concentration and denitrification genes (particularly nirK, r = 0.61, p < 0.01) than with emission flux in AWD mode. Water layer depth had a stronger effect on emission fluxes (direct effect = -0.57) than soil nitrogen metabolic activities (direct effect = -0.37 and 0.31) in AWD mode. Conclusions: Therefore, strategic regulation of water layer depth may mitigate the N2O emission without considering denitrification activity in the 10-20 cm layer in AWD mode.

TI  - Nitrogen availability mediates soil carbon cycling response to climate warming: A meta-analysis
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Global climate warming may induce a positive feedback through increasing soil carbon (C) release to the atmosphere. Although warming can affect both C input to and output from soil, direct and convincing evidence illustrating that warming induces a net change in soil C is still lacking. We synthesized the results from field warming experiments at 165 sites across the globe and found that climate warming had no significant effect on soil C stock. On average, warming significantly increased root biomass and soil respiration, but warming effects on root biomass and soil respiration strongly depended on soil nitrogen (N) availability. Under high N availability (soil C:N ratio < 15), warming had no significant effect on root biomass, but promoted the coupling between effect sizes of root biomass and soil C stock. Under relative N limitation (soil C:N ratio > 15), warming significantly enhanced root biomass. However, the enhancement of root biomass did not induce a corresponding C accumulation in soil, possibly because warming promoted microbial CO2 release that offset the increased root C input. Also, reactive N input alleviated warming-induced C loss from soil, but elevated atmospheric CO2 or precipitation increase/reduction did not. Together, our findings indicate that the relative availability of soil C to N (i.e., soil C:N ratio) critically mediates warming effects on soil C dynamics, suggesting that its incorporation into C-climate models may improve the prediction of soil C cycling under future global warming scenarios.

TI  - Magnitude, direction, and drivers of rhizosphere effect on soil nitrogen and phosphorus in global agroecosystem
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
AB  - The rhizosphere is the most active soil area for material transformation and energy flow of soil, root, and microorganism, which plays an important role in soil biochemical cycling. Although the rhizospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) were easily disturbed in the agroecosystem, the effects of rhizosphere on the dynamics of soil N and P cycling have not yet been systematically quantified globally. We sum-marized the magnitude, direction, and driving forces of rhizosphere effects on agroecosystem's N and P dynamics by 1063 observations and 15 variables from 122 literature. Rhizosphere effects increased available N (AN, 9%), available P (AP, 11%), and total P (TP, 5%), and decreased nitrate N (NO3-N, 18%) and ammonia N (NH4-N, 16%). The effect of rhizosphere on total N (TN) was not significant. These effects improved AN in tropical (12%) and subtropical (14%) regions. The effect of rhizosphere on TP was greater under subtropical conditions than in other climates. The most substantial effects of the rhizosphere on TP and AP were observed under humid conditions. Rhizosphere effects increased AN and AP in vegetables more than in other crop systems. Application of N > 300 kg ha-1 had the most significant and positive rhizosphere effects on TN and AN. P application of 100-150 kg ha-1 had the greatest rhizosphere effects on TP and AP. These effects also improved the microbial (biomass N and P) and enzymatic aspects (urease, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase) of soil P and N cycling. Structural equation modeling suggested that aridity indices, fertilizer application rate, soil pH, microbial biomass, and soil enzymes strongly influence the magnitude and direction of the rhizosphere's effect on the P and N cycles. Overall, these findings are critical for improving soil nutrient utilization efficiency and modeling nutrient cycling in the rhizosphere for agricultural systems.& COPY; 2022 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation, China Water and Power Press, and China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research.

TI  - Linking microbial communities, functional genes and nitrogen-cycling processes in forest floors under four tree species
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Tree species can influence rates of soil N transformations, but the question remains whether differences in N cycling rates are mirrored by the abundance of relevant functional genes. We studied whether the influence of tree species on soil N transformation processes and abundance of functional genes exist across two sites in British Columbia with different N availability. We used the 15N pool-dilution method to estimate gross rates of ammonification and nitrification in forest floors of four conifers in a common garden experiment. The abundances of bacteria, fungi, nitrification (AOA amoA, AOB amoA) and denitrification (nirS, nirK) genes were determined by qPCR. Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) had the highest rates of gross ammonification and NHT consumption, followed by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii); all species showed net nitrate immobilization. Western red cedar forest floors had the greatest abundance of bacterial 16S genes and ammonia oxidizing archaea amoA genes. This suggests that tree species foster different abundances of ammonification and denitrification functional groups. Differences in N transformation rates between the sites were related to site N status, as reflected in C:N ratios of the forest floor and microbial biomass, and were more closely tied to rates of N consumption rather than gross mineralization. Rates of most N transformation processes were related to microbial C:N ratio, indicating that the N status of microbes rather than their biomass or activity level determined the rates of N cycling. Ammonification rates were associated with forest floor and microbial biomass C:N ratio as well as bacterial and fungal abundances. Nitrification rates and denitrification gene abundance were associated with microbial biomass C:N ratios and AOA amoA gene abundance. The forest floor's genetic potential for denitrification was positively correlated with its nitrification potential as indicated by ammonia-oxidizer abundance. We conclude that tree species influenced forest floor N cycling and soil microbial gene abundances, and that functional genetics can be useful for exploring mechanistic links between tree species and nitrogen cycling processes.

TI  - Physicochemical and microbiological effects of long- and short-term winery wastewater application to soils
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Application of winery wastewaters to soils for irrigation of various crops or landscapes is a common practice in the wine industry. In this study, we sought to investigate the effects of this practice, by comparing the physicochemical and microbiological soil properties in paired sites that differed in having had a history of winery waste application or not. We also compared the effects of a single application of untreated winery wastewater, to application of treated winery wastewater (sequencing batch reactor) and pure water to eliminate the effects of wetting alone. Long-term application of winery wastes was found to have significant impacts on soil microbial community structure, as determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis, as well as on many physicochemical properties including pH, EC, and cation concentrations. C-13 NMR revealed only slight differences in the nature of the carbon present at each of the paired sites. A single application of untreated winery wastewater was shown to have significant impacts upon soil respiration, nitrogen cycling and microbial community structure, but the treated wastewater application showed no significant differences to wetting alone. Results are discussed in the context of sustainable winery wastewater disposal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Controls on the respiratory quotient of organic matter decomposition across ecosystems
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - There is substantial variation in estimates of the respiratory quotient (RQ), i.e., molar ratio of produced CO2 and consumed O2 during microbial mineralization of organic matter (OM). While several studies have examined RQ's controlling factors in terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems, there are no broader cross-ecosystem comparisons, and there is a lack of general understanding of the extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (organic matter composition) controls on RQ. In this study, we examine RQ across a broad range of environments, including soils, aquatic sediments, lake and coastal water. We measured CO2 production and O2 consumption using membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS). We also assessed the microbial metabolic profiles using BIOLOG EcoPlates and determined the energy content of the natural OM with bomb calorimetry and its elemental composition. We show that RQ differs significantly between the ecosystem types and strongly deviates from the frequently assumed value of 1. In addition, microbial mineralization across the different studied ecosystems is correlated with the bulk energy content of the OM (kJ g-1 organic carbon). Finally, RQ was correlated to the metabolic profiles of microorganisms, as estimated based on BIOLOG EcoPlates. We argue that an increased use of cross-ecosystem experimental studies will enhance the understanding of the factors controlling carbon cycling.

TI  - Decomposition of lignin in wheat straw in a sand-dune grassland
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The degradation of organic macromolecules, including lignin, in plant-derived soil organic matter, is important to the global carbon cycle. In grasslands, saprotrophic (decomposer) fungi are major decomposers of such organic material. The aim of this study was to characterise lignin degradation, particularly with respect to lignin oxidation typical of white-rot basidiomycete fungi. Lignin breakdown products, analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with TMAH thermochemolysis, in initial wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Swatham) straw samples were compared with those in samples which had been buried as a "model" resource for 46 months in a sand-dune grassland at Ainsdale National Nature Reserve, Lancashire, UK.
   Our results showed that lignin oxidation occurred in the straw over the 46 month period, as there were general increases in the [Ac/Al](5) and [Ac/Al](G) ratios and a clear decrease in the [S/G] ratio. These data provide tentative support for the theory that white-rot basidiomycete fungi are involved in the degradation of lignin in grasslands. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Differential Sensitivity of Wetland-Derived Nitrogen Cycling Microorganisms to Copper Nanoparticles
T2  - ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING
AB  - Metallic nanoparticles (NPs), the most abundant nanomaterials in consumer and industrial products, are the most probable class to enter and potentially affect the environment. In this study, wetland-derived microcosms were incubated with copper nanoparticles (Cu-NP) and ionic CuCl2 to investigate acute (10 days) and chronic (100 days) exposures to nitrogen cycling microorganisms. Gene abundance and expression changes were monitored using the GeoChip 5.0 high throughput functional gene microarray and metatranscriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq), respectively. After 10 days, the Cu-NP impacted microbial communities experienced structural shifts within microorganisms associated with dissimilatory nitrogen reduction accompanied by lower nitrate removal as compared to the unexposed controls. By day 100, these differences were largely resolved and nitrate removal was similar to the unexposed control. Furthermore, the Cu-NP exposed microcosms tolerated copper and were more resilient and adaptive than the unexposed controls based on the abundance of copper oxidase (cueO), copper efflux (cusC), and bacterial adaptive response (opuE, soxS, desR, baeS) genes. These findings suggest that sudden influxes of Cu-NPs into wetland systems may impair nitrogen removal initially, but long-term microbial shifts and functional redundancy would promote the net flux of total nitrogen out of the wetlands.

TI  - Ammonia oxidation and nitrate reduction marker genes are key indicators of nitrogen losses in temperate forest catchments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Chronic nitrogen inputs can alleviate N limitation and potentially impose N losses in forests, indicated by soil enrichment in N-15 over N-14. However, the complexity of the nitrogen cycle hinders accurate quantification of N fluxes. Simultaneously, soil ecologists are striving to find meaningful indicators to characterise the "openness" of the nitrogen cycle. We integrate soil delta N-15 with constrained ecosystem N losses and the functional gene potential of the soil microbiome in 14 temperate forest catchments. We show that N losses are associated with soil delta N-15 and that delta N-15 scales with the abundance of soil bacteria. The abundance of the archaeal amoA gene, representing the first step in nitrification (ammonia oxidation to nitrite), followed by the abundance of narG and napA genes, associated with the first step in denitrification (nitrate reduction to nitrite), explains most of the variability in soil delta N-15. These genes are more informative than the denitrification genes nirS and nirK, which are directly linked to N2O production. Nitrite formation thus appears to be the critical step associated with N losses. Furthermore, we show that the genetic potential for ammonia oxidation and nitrate reduction is representative of forest soil N-15 enrichment and thus indicative of ecosystem N losses.

TI  - Microbial responses to the erosional redistribution of soil organic carbon in arable fields
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Quantifying the potential for eroding agricultural soils to act as sinks or sources of atmospheric carbon relies on accounting for the pools and fluxes of soil organic carbon (SOC) and nutrients, e.g. nitrogen (N), affected by erosion. Herein, we report the outcomes of an experiment where a C-4 maize (Zea mays) crop (delta C-13 = -12.1 parts per thousand,) was cultivated and incorporated for 2 years to introduce a 'pulse' of C-13-enriched SOC to a C-3 arable soil (delta C-13 = -27.4 parts per thousand). Soils were sampled at eroding (top slope and upper slope) and depositional (lower slope and slope foot) positions of an accelerated erosion pathway that were confirmed using Cs-137 measurements. The sand particle-sized fraction (63-2000 mu m) was predominant and increased in the depositional slope positions due to selective loss of fine particles and preferential deposition of the coarsest fraction of transported sediment. There was a significant isometric relationship between the percentage SOC and total N: top slope > upper slope > lower slope, with similar values in the slope foot to the top slope. The delta N-15 values of the soils were enriched (7.3 parts per thousand) at the slope foot, compared with the other slope positions (average 6.3 parts per thousand), suggesting increased denitrification rates. The delta C-13 values of the soil microbial biomass C extracted from surface soils (0-5 cm) at each slope position showed that the proportion of maize C being incorporated into the soil microbial biomass declined in the downslope direction from 54% (top slope) to 43% (upper slope) to 18% (lower slope) in inverse proportion to the size of the soil microbial biomass, and increased to 41% at the slope foot. This suggests dynamic replacement of the SOC with crop C in the eroding slope positions and dilution of the transported C by C3-SOC in the depositional slope positions. This paper is evidence that erosional distribution of soil carbon leads to differential microbial utilisation of SOC between eroding and depositional sites. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Long-Term Nutrient Enrichment of an Oligotroph-Dominated Wetland Increases Bacterial Diversity in Bulk Soils and Plant Rhizospheres
T2  - MSPHERE
AB  - In nutrient-limited conditions, plants rely on rhizosphere microbial members to facilitate nutrient acquisition, and in return, plants provide carbon resources to these root-associated microorganisms. However, atmospheric nutrient deposition can affect plant-microbe relationships by changing soil bacterial composition and by reducing cooperation between microbial taxa and plants. To examine how long-term nutrient addition shapes rhizosphere community composition, we compared traits associated with bacterial (fast-growing copiotrophs, slow-growing oligotrophs) and plant (C-3 forb, C-4 grass) communities residing in a nutrient-poor wetland ecosystem. Results revealed that oligotrophic taxa dominated soil bacterial communities and that fertilization increased the presence of oligotrophs in bulk and rhizosphere communities. Additionally, bacterial species diversity was greatest in fertilized soils, particularly in bulk soils. Nutrient enrichment (fertilized versus unfertilized) and plant association (bulk versus rhizosphere) determined bacterial community composition; bacterial community structure associated with plant functional group (grass versus forb) was similar within treatments but differed between fertilization treatments. The core forb microbiome consisted of 602 unique taxa, and the core grass microbiome consisted of 372 unique taxa. Forb rhizospheres were enriched in potentially disease-suppressive bacterial taxa, and grass rhizospheres were enriched in bacterial taxa associated with complex carbon decomposition. Results from this study demonstrate that fertilization serves as a strong environmental filter on the soil microbiome, which leads to distinct rhizosphere communities and can shift plant effects on the rhizosphere microbiome. These taxonomic shifts within plant rhizospheres could have implications for plant health and ecosystem functions associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling.
   IMPORTANCE Over the last century, humans have substantially altered nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Use of synthetic fertilizer and burning of fossil fuels and biomass have increased nitrogen and phosphorus deposition, which results in unintended fertilization of historically low-nutrient ecosystems. With increased nutrient availability, plant biodiversity is expected to decline, and the abundance of copiotrophic taxa is anticipated to increase in bacterial communities. Here, we address how bacterial communities associated with different plant functional types (forb, grass) shift due to long-term nutrient enrichment. Unlike other studies, results revealed an increase in bacterial diversity, particularly of oligotrophic bacteria in fertilized plots. We observed that nutrient addition strongly determines forb and grass rhizosphere composition, which could indicate different metabolic preferences in the bacterial communities. This study highlights how long-term fertilization of oligotroph-dominated wetlands could alter diversity and metabolism of rhizosphere bacterial communities in unexpected ways.

TI  - Soil depth and grassland origin cooperatively shape microbial community co-occurrence and function
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Many soils are deep, yet soil below 20 cm remains largely unexplored. Exotic plants can have shallower roots than native species, so their impact on microorganisms is anticipated to change with depth. Using environmental DNA and extracellular enzymatic activities, we studied fungal and bacterial community composition, diversity, function, and co-occurrence networks between native and exotic grasslands at soil depths up to 1 m. We hypothesized (1) the composition and network structure of both fungal and bacterial communities will change with increasing depth, and diversity and enzymatic function will decrease; (2) microbial enzymatic function and network connectedness will be lower in exotic grasslands; and (3) irrigation will alter microbial networks, increasing the overall connectedness. Microbial diversity decreased with depth, and community composition was distinctly different between shallow and deeper soil depths with higher numbers of unknown taxa in lower soil depths. Fungal communities differed between native and exotic plant communities. Microbial community networks were strongly shaped by biotic and abiotic factors concurrently and were the only microbial measurement affected by irrigation. In general, fungal communities were more connected in native plant communities than exotic, especially below 10 cm. Fungal networks were also more connected at lower soil depths albeit with fewer nodes. Bacterial communities demonstrated higher complexity, and greater connectedness and nodes, at lower soil depths for native plant communities. Exotic plant communities' bacterial network connectedness altered at lower soil depths dependent on irrigation treatments. Microbial extracellular enzyme activity for carbon cycling enzymes significantly declined with soil depth, but enzymes associated with nitrogen and phosphorus cycling continued to have similar activities up to 1 m deep. Our results indicate that native and exotic grasslands have significantly different fungal communities in depths up to 1 m and that both fungal and bacterial networks are strongly shaped jointly by plant communities and abiotic factors. Soil depth is independently a major determinant of both fungal and bacterial community structures, functions, and co-occurrence networks and demonstrates further the importance of including soil itself when investigating plant-microbe interactions.

TI  - Relationships of plant traits and soil biota to soil functions change as nitrogen fertiliser rates increase in an intensively managed agricultural system
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Because plant and soil systems are strongly inter-linked, manipulating plant traits in intensively managed agricultural systems could be used to improve soil functioning and sustainability. However, we have little understanding of whether the impacts of plant traits on soil systems are modified by other management practices, such as fertiliser use. We tested whether relationships among plant traits, soil biota (microbes and nematodes) and soil functions (carbon and nitrogen (N) cycling) change with N fertiliser regime in a field-based, intensively managed experiment with high biomass removal. The experiment consisted of seven plant species compositions crossed with six N fertiliser rates (0-500 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Relationships among plant traits, soil biota and soil functions were often consistent across N fertiliser rates. However, the relationship of percentage N(2)fixer toqCO(2)shifted from negative to neutral as N rates increased, and the slope of several relationships of plant traits to N cycling indicators declined when >200 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)was added. The negative relationship of the fungal: bacterial ratio to N cycling indicators also became neutral when > 200 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)was added, and the relationships of bacterivore abundance and the plant parasitic index to respiration changed direction as N inputs increased. Some relationships of plant traits and soil biota to soil functions were in unexpected directions. This was sometimes associated with species-specific effects and inconsistent trait trade-offs within species. In general, conservative plant traits and fungal dominance were associated with low N cycling and cellulose paper decomposition rates, but high respiration rates. Nematode-based variables were better predictors of some functions than microbial ones; their incorporation into plant trait research could improve predictive power and system understanding. Synthesis and applications. Manipulating plant community traits can modify soil functions in intensively managed systems, but may result in larger changes where fertiliser nitrogen inputs are relatively low. Improved modelling that integrates how plant community traits, species-specific effects and management practices interact to determine soil functions will be required before managers can confidently predict the consequences of changing plant community traits.

TI  - Soil and microbial properties of green infrastructure stormwater management systems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Green infrastructure (GI) refers to environmental design features or engineered systems in an interconnected natural and urban space that provide multifunctional ecosystem services. However, there is great uncertainty and variation in the function of different GI features related to carbon and nitrogen cycling processes that are essential for sustained plant growth and water quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of GI designs (enhanced tree pits (ETP), street-side infiltration swales (SSIS), and vegetation swales (VS)), including surface area, and watershed area ratio (WAR), on the biogeochemical processes and properties (organic carbon (C-org), total nitrogen (N-total), pH, salts, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), Pb, Zn, moisture content (MC), texture, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen content, potential net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification, microbial respiration, and denitrification potential) of GI engineered soils. Results showed that GI sites did not have significant levels of contamination with metals or TPH and that GI with larger surface area had significantly lower TPH, Pb, and Zn. Microbial biomass and activity were positively correlated with Corg, Ntotal, pH, MC, TPH, and WAR. Denitrification potential was higher in the ETP and SSIS (3 mg N kg(-1) h(-1)) compared to the VS (0.5 mg N kg(-1) h(-1)). Microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen contents were significantly higher in ETP followed by SSIS then VS. These results suggest that relatively young (< 10 years) GI sites provide significant levels of microbial biomass and activity that are important for carbon and nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Diversity and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in the Dongjiang River, China
T2  - MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Nitrification in aquatic ecosystems plays a crucial role in the global nitrogen cycling. It has been widely accepted that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are responsible for nitrification. However, this concept is currently challenged by the ubiquity of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in various environments, such as in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, the presence of AOA in the Dongjiang River was documented via archaeal amoA amplification; the abundance of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes were estimated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and the diversity was investigated by sequencing of archaeal amoA gene. Based on retrieved sequences and phylogenetic analysis, the majority of sequences obtained were different from Crenarchaeota phylum of marine and soil, affiliated with Freshwater Cluster 1 crenarchaeota. The results showed that the AOA detected fell into clusters which are specifically associated with freshwater habitats, and AOA was more abundance than AOB by around 2-4 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it was found that AOA was more prefer to aerobic and relative low-ammonia concentrations in fresh water. Our finding provides a vital supplement to the distribution of AOA in global pattern, and offers implications for further understanding of the potential role of ammonia oxidizers in river ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of snow absence on winter soil nitrogen dynamics in a subalpine spruce forest of southwestern China
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - The lack of snow cover due to winter climate change has great potential to impact winter soil nitrogen cycling in boreal forests. A snow manipulation was conducted in a Tibetan spruce forest to explore the effects of snow absence on winter soil nitrogen dynamics by shelter method. Snow absence on average reduced soil temperatures at the depths of 0 cm and 5 cm by 1.44 degrees C and 0.33 degrees C, respectively, throughout the winter. Moreover, snow absence increased soil frost and freeze-thaw cycles. Soil net nitrogen mineralization and labile nitrogen pools (ammonium, nitrate and dissolved organic nitrogen) were higher in the snow absence plots compared to control plots. Snow absence increased soil microbial biomass carbon but did not affect microbial biomass nitrogen. Nevertheless, soil enzyme activities involved in nitrogen cycles were often lowered by snow absence over the winter. The results noted in this study suggest that warming-induced absence in seasonal snowpack may stimulate winter soil nitrogen availabilities by changing soil microhabitats, which has important implications for soil biogeochemical cycles in the subalpine forest ecosystems on the eastern Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Chlorella emersonii Inoculation Improves Pakchoi Yield and Nitrogen Use Efficiency Through Amending the Rhizosphere Microbial Community
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION
AB  - An experiment of pakchoi after conventional fertilization was conducted with Chlorella emersonii inoculation. The yield, nitrogen use efficiency, and rhizosphere microbial community of pakchoi were investigated, and the relationship among them was also determined. The results showed that C. emersonii inoculation with half dose increased the fresh weight and nitrogen use efficiency of pakchoi by 6.5% and 28.1%, respectively. Rhizosphere microbial community structure after C. emersonii inoculation was distinctly affected, which reflected the higher bacterial alpha diversity and lower fungal alpha diversity, and had positive and negative correlations with pakchoi performance characteristics, respectively. The dominant phyla showed that C. emersonii inoculation significantly increased the abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased the abundance of Actinobacteria for bacteria, however, all fungal abundances also decreased. At a higher classification resolution, C. emersonii inoculation enriched the indigenous Sphingomonas and introduced the nonindigenous Pseudofulvimonas involved in the nitrogen cycle, which might be responsible for the improvement of pakchoi yield by enhancing nitrogen use efficiency. The higher bacterial alpha diversity with enriched Sphingomonas and Pseudofulvimonas might provide a driving force for the greater pakchoi yield and nitrogen use efficiency under the half dose of C. emersonii inoculation compared with the total dose. This study suggested that C. emersonii inoculation improved the yield and nitrogen use efficiency of pakchoi through the amendment of beneficial rhizosphere microflora, especially those related to the nitrogen cycle, and confirmed the positive effectiveness of conventional fertilization regimes together with C. emersonii inoculation on fertilization efficiency and agricultural production.

TI  - Microbial genetic potential differs among cryospheric habitats of the Damma glacier
T2  - MICROBIAL GENOMICS
AB  - Climate warming has led to glacier retreat worldwide. Studies on the taxonomy and functions of glacier microbiomes help us better predict their response to glacier melting. Here, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to study the microbial functional potential in different cryospheric habitats, i.e. surface snow, supraglacial and subglacial sediments, subglacial ice, proglacial stream water and recently deglaciated soils. The functional gene structure varied greatly among habitats, especially for snow, which differed significantly from all other habitats. Differential abundance analysis revealed that genes related to stress responses (e.g. chaperones) were enriched in ice habitat, supporting the fact that glaciers are a harsh environment for microbes. The microbial metabolic capabilities related to carbon and nitrogen cycling vary among cryospheric habitats. Genes related to auxiliary activities were overrepresented in the subglacial sediment, suggesting a higher genetic potential for the degradation of recalcitrant carbon (e.g., lignin). As for nitrogen cycling, genes related to nitrogen fixation were more abundant in barren proglacial soils, possibly due to the presence of Cyanobacteriota in this habitat. Our results deepen our understanding of microbial processes in glacial ecosystems, which are vulnerable to ongoing global warming, and they have implications for downstream ecosystems.

TI  - Comparative performance of conservation agriculture vis-a-vis organic and conventional farming, in enhancing plant attributes and rhizospheric bacterial diversity in Cajanus cajan: A field study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - The intensification of agriculture to meet the ever-increasing demand for food has exerted a negative impact on the ecosystem. Conservation agriculture has been highlighted as a comprehensive approach to sustainability. The present study aimed to assess the performance of conservation agriculture (CA) on plant growth, and its impact on bacterial community composition, specifically guilds involved in nitrogen (N) cycling, in comparison to conventional (CT), and organic agriculture (OA). A field experiment was set up with Cajanus cajan (pigeonpea) under the three agricultural practices with a total of nine modules. The rhizospheric bacterial community composition was examined using Illumina sequencing with the 16S rRNA gene as a marker. The bacterial community involved in nitrogen cycling was examined by analysis of key genes involved in pathways, viz. nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrification (amoA), and denitrification (narG and nirK) by qPCR. Plant growth parameters and grain yield of C.cajan were relatively higher in CA-based modules. Enhanced abundances of genes involved in the N cycle were observed under CA compared to CT and OA. CA had the highest alpha diversity at the phylum level, while CT had the lowest. Proteobacteria (28%), Planctomycetes (15-19%), Acidobacteria (10-12%), and Bacteroidetes (10-15%) were the dominant phyla across the three agricultural practices. A significant correlation could be drawn between the performance of agricultural management practice, and bacterial community structure and function. The research adds to our understanding of the various mechanisms involved in the promotion of plant growth and soil diversity under sustainable means of agriculture. Besides it emphasizes the significance of rhizospheric bacterial communities as ecological indicators for soil health in arable land.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics in leaf litter decomposing microbial communities in temperate forests: a whole-genomesequencing-based study
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Leaf litter decomposition, a crucial component of the global carbon cycle, relies on the pivotal role played by microorganisms. However, despite their ecological importance, leaf-litter-decomposing microorganism taxonomic and functional diversity needs additional study. This study explores the taxonomic composition, dynamics, and functional role of microbial communities that decompose leaf litter of forest-forming tree species in two ecologically unique regions of Europe. Twenty-nine microbial metagenomes isolated from the leaf litter of eight forest-forming species of woody plants were investigated by Illumina technology using read- and assembly-based approaches of sequences analysis. The taxonomic structure of the microbial community varies depending on the stage of litter decomposition; however, the community's core is formed by Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Stenotrophomonas, and Pedobacter genera of Bacteria and by Aureobasidium, Penicillium, Venturia genera of Fungi. A comparative analysis of the taxonomic structure and composition of the microbial communities revealed that in both regions, seasonal changes in structure take place; however, there is no clear pattern in its dynamics. Functional gene analysis of MAGs revealed numerous metabolic profiles associated with leaf litter degradation. This highlights the diverse metabolic capabilities of microbial communities and their implications for ecosystem processes, including the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during organic matter decomposition. This study provides important advances in understanding of ecosystem processes and the carbon cycle, underscoring the need to unravel the intricacies of microbial communities within these contexts.

TI  - A Reasonable Rotation Fallow Mode Enhances the Complexity of the Soil Bacterial Network and Enriches Nitrogen-Cycling-Related Taxa
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Rotation fallow is an effective way to overcome the obstacles associated with continuous cropping, being beneficial for the growth and development of crops. Soil micro-organisms are closely related to soil fertility, plant productivity, soil pathogenic bacteria, and crop health in agricultural ecosystems. To explore the effects of different rotation fallow modes on the diversity and functions of the soil bacterial community, a study was conducted in an arid area in the western foothills of the Greater Khingan Mountains. Using spring wheat variety Longmai 36 as the research material, this study systematically analyzed the changes and functional differences in soil physicochemical and biological characteristics, as well as microbial communities (endosphere, rhizosphere, and bulk soil) in spring wheat fields under five rotation fallow modes: Wheat(2016)-Wheat(2017)-Wheat(2018)(WWW), Wheat(2016)-Rape(2017)-Fallow(2018)(WRF), Wheat(2016)-Potato(2017)-Fallow(2018)(WPF), Wheat(2016)-Fallow(2017)-Rape(2018)(WFR), and Wheat(2016)-Fallow(2017)-Potato(2018) (WFP). The results indicate that, compared to WWW, the soil urease activity, microbial biomass nitrogen content, and microbial biomass phosphorus content were significantly increased in the WFP mode (p < 0.05). In particular, the soil moisture content, organic matter, and total potassium content were increased by 6.88%, 3.34%, and 25.57%, respectively. The Shannon index and chao1 index of bulk soil (BS) and rhizosphere (RS) bacteria were significantly higher than those of endosphere (ER) bacteria (p < 0.05). Both ecological niche and rotation fallow modes affected the relative abundance of dominant bacteria, and the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Verrucomimicrobia, significantly increased in the rotation fallow modes. The complexity and stability of bacterial networks, and abundance of nitrogen-cycling-related functional taxa were significantly improved, while the abundance of pathogen-related functional taxa was significantly decreased. The differences in soil bacterial community structure were closely related to soil physicochemical properties. Compared to ER, BS and RS bacterial communities, which are more susceptible to soil physicochemical properties, and soil pH are key driving forces for bacterial community distribution. In summary, compared with continuous cropping, the rotation fallow mode is beneficial for conserving soil moisture and nutrients, stabilizing soil pH, (i.e., making the soil tend to be neutral), increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria in the soil, enhancing the complexity and stability of microbial ecological networks, and increasing the abundance of nitrogen-cycling-related functional taxa, thus improving crop growth and development.

TI  - Change in composition and function of microbial communities in an acid bamboo (Phyllostachys praecox) plantation soil with the addition of three different biochars
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Biochar has been known as means to increase soil carbon (C) storage, and at the same time to ameliorate soil acidity and enhance plant growth. However, how biochar addition affects microbial community composition and metabolic function in subtropical plantation soils and their linkage with soil quality change is still poorly understood. We selected bamboo stick, corn straw and peel of Carya cathayensis as feedstocks to produce three biochars at 350 degrees C by slow pyrolysis, and added them to an acid bamboo (Phyllostachys praecox) plantation soil. Changes in soil nutrient and C availability, soil acidity, plant biomass, and microbial function in terms of C source utilization and soil enzyme activities were investigated after a three-month greenhouse trial. The results showed that the biochars from corn straw and peel significantly increased plant biomass, soil pH, organic C, total nitrogen (N) and dissolved organic N contents, while decreased exchangeable H+ and exchangeable Al3+ concentrations. The concentration of total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) was increased significantly under biochars from corn straw and peel. The activities of beta-D-cellobiosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and acid phosphatase were significantly increased by peel biochar. Soil basal respiration and microbial utilization rate of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and amino acids compounds were significantly increased under the three biochars, suggesting a higher capacity of biochar-treated soil to catabolize C sources. Increased plant biomass was related to the increased N availability and decreased acidity. Our study suggests that biochar-induced changes in soil acidity and soil nutrient availability are key drivers shaping the composition of microbial communities and enhancing their catabolic capacity, but the effects on soil microbial function vary depending on feedstock origins.

TI  - Spatial distribution and source apportionment of nitrogen in typical plain river networks and bacterial community response
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction The Yubei plain river network (YPRN) is confined and has poor hydrodynamics, resulting in the accumulation of pollutants. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore the mechanisms by which different anthropogenic contamination sources-namely domestic, aquaculture, industrial, and agricultural-affect nitrogen content, as well as the composition of nitrifying, denitrifying, and other bacterial communities.Methods This study determined delta 15N and delta 18O by bacterial denitrification, and quantitatively evaluate the contribution of pollution source through MixSIAR. And the changes of the bacterial community were analyzed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Results The concentration of total nitrogen (TN) revealed a distinct spatial pattern, with the industrial area demonstrating the highest levels, followed closely by the aquaculture area and the domestic and agricultural areas. The stable isotope analysis delineated three dominant pollution source areas within the study region: i) an industrial pollution dominant area, accounting for 55% of the pollutant load; ii) a domestic pollution dominant area (39%); and iii) an aquaculture pollution dominant area (43%). The industry pollution samples demonstrated the highest TN concentrations and the lowest NO3-/TN ratio. Strong nitrification activity under high dissolved oxygen (DO) in the study area was investigated using stable isotope analysis. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Desulfobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla in the study area. Notably, Malikia species with nitrate-reducing capabilities were significantly more abundant in the industrially pollution area compared to the other pollution areas.Discussion The diversity of nitrogen types characteristic of the domestic pollution area mediated bacterial selection pressures, favoring nitrogen cycling and amplifying functional gene abundance. This bacterial activity enhanced nitrogen cycle efficiency, ultimately reducing nitrogen concentrations. Bacterial analyses revealed marked divergence in both community composition and function across different pollution types. Particularly, ecological network analysis showed greater complexity and more network links in the aquaculture pollution area. Overall, the results revealed the impacts of different pollution sources on the ecological processes shaping river microbial communities and determined variations in bacterial diversity and nitrogen-cycling gene abundances.

TI  - Plant Functional Diversity, Climate and Grazer Type Regulate Soil Activity in Natural Grasslands
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Global change modifies vegetation composition in grasslands with shifts in plant functional types (PFT). Although changes in plant community composition imply changes in soil function, this relationship is not well understood. We investigated the relative importance of environmental (climatic, management and soil) variables and plant functional diversity (PFT composition and interactions) on soil activity and fertility along a climatic gradient. We collected samples of soil and PFT biomass (grasses, legumes, and non-legume forbs) in six extensively managed grasslands along a climatic gradient in the Northern Iberian Peninsula. Variation Partitioning Analysis showed that abiotic and management variables explained most of the global variability (96.5%) in soil activity and fertility; soil moisture and grazer type being the best predictors. PFT diversity accounted for 27% of the total variability, mostly in interaction with environmental factors. Diversity-Interaction models applied on each response variable revealed that PFT-evenness and pairwise interactions affected particularly the nitrogen cycle, enhancing microbial biomass nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, total nitrogen, urease, phosphatase, and nitrification potential. Thus, soil activity and fertility were not only regulated by environmental variables, but also enhanced by PFT diversity. We underline that climate change-induced shifts in vegetation composition can alter greenhouse gas-related soil processes and eventually the feedback of the soil to the atmosphere.

TI  - Microplastics altered soil microbiome and nitrogen cycling: The role of phthalate plasticizer
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastics are emerging contaminants that are increasingly detected in soil environment, but their impact on soil microbiota and related biogeochemical processes remains poorly understood. In particular, the mechanisms involved (e.g., the role of chemical additives) are still elusive. In this study, we found that plasticizer-containing polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastics at 0.5% (w/w) significantly increased soil NH4+-N content and decreased NO3--N content by up to 91%, and shaped soil microbiota into a microbial system with more nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (as indicated by nifDHK gene abundance), urea decomposers (ureABC genes and urease activity) and nitrate reducers (nasA, NR, NIT-6 and napAB genes), and less nitrifiers (amoC gene and potential nitrification rate). Exposure to plasticizer alone had a similar effect on soil nitrogen parameters but microplastics of pure PVC polymer (either granule or film) had little effect over 60 days, indicating that phthalate plasticizer released from microplastics was the main driver of effects observed. Furthermore, a direct link between phthalate plasticizer, microbial taxonomic changes and altered nitrogen metabolism was established by the isolation of phthalate-degrading bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling. This study highlights the importance of chemical additives in determining the interplay of microplastics with microbes and nutrient cycling, which needs to be considered in future studies.

TI  - Wildfire exacerbates high-latitude soil carbon losses from climate warming
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Arctic and boreal permafrost soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition has been slower than carbon inputs from plant growth since the last glaciation. Anthropogenic climate warming has threatened this historical trend by accelerating SOC decomposition and altering wildfire regimes. We accurately modeled observed plant biomass and carbon emissions from wildfires in Alaskan ecosystems under current climate conditions. In projections to 2300 under the RCP8.5 climate scenario, we found that warming and increased atmospheric CO2 will result in plant biomass gains and higher litterfall. However, increased carbon losses from (a) wildfire combustion and (b) rapid SOC decomposition driven by increased deciduous litter production, root exudation, and active layer depth will lead to about 4.4 PgC of soil carbon losses from Alaska by 2300 and most (88%) of these loses will be from the top 1 m of soil. These SOC losses offset plant carbon gains, causing the ecosystem to transition to a net carbon source after 2200. Simulations excluding wildfire increases yielded about a factor of four lower SOC losses by 2300. Our results show that projected wildfire and its direct and indirect effects on plant and soil carbon may accelerate high-latitude soil carbon losses, resulting in a positive feedback to climate change.

TI  - The molecular composition of soil organic matter is regulated by bacterial community under biochar application
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) consists of diverse carbon compounds, which are influenced by microorganisms that affect its turnover and stability. However, changes in SOM molecular composition following biochar application and their interactions with the soil bacterial communities remain poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate SOM molecular composition, soil bacterial communities, and carbon cycle functional genes of bacteria in soils treated with biochar using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (py-GC/MS) and amplicon sequencing. The py-GC/MS results indicated that biochar increased the molecular diversity and significantly altered the molecular composition of SOM. In biochar-treated soils, the abundance of lignin-derived products increases, while lipids levels decrease. Biochar application shifted the soil bacterial life-history strategy towards copiotrophy, characterised by a higher copiotroph/oligotroph ratio and ribosomal RNA operon copy number. Procrustes analysis revealed that SOM molecular composition was strongly correlated with both the bacterial community and carbon cycle functional genes. Specifically, the SOM composition was closely associated with Gammaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Additionally, SOM network analysis indicated that biochar enhanced SOM molecular complexity (i.e., node count, edge count, and average degree) primarily due to the accumulation of lignin-derived products. These findings highlight the potential of biochar to reshape the molecular composition of SOM via microbially mediated processes.

TI  - Stimulating Nitrate Removal Processes of Restored Wetlands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The environmental and health effects caused by nitrate contamination of aquatic systems are a serious problem throughout the world. A strategy proposed to address nitrate pollution is the restoration of wetlands. However, although natural wetlands often remove nitrate via high rates of denitrification, wetlands restored for water quality functions often fall below expectations. This may be in part because key drivers for denitrification, in particular soil carbon, are slow to develop in restored wetlands. We added organic soil amendments that range along a gradient of carbon lability to four newly restored wetlands in western New York to investigate the effect of carbon additions on denitrification and other processes of the nitrogen cycle. Soil carbon increased by 12.67-63.30% with the use of soil amendments (p <= 0.0001). Soil nitrate, the carbon to nitrogen ratio, and microbial biomass nitrogen were the most significant predictors of denitrification potential. Denitrification potential, potential net nitrogen nitrification and mineralization, and soil nitrate and ammonium, were highest in topsoil-amended plots, with increases in denitrification potential of 161.27% over control plots. While amendment with topsoil more than doubled several key nitrogen cycling processes, more research is required to determine what type and level of amendment application are most effective for stimulating removal of exogenous nitrate and meeting functional goals within an acceptable time frame.

TI  - Soot biodegradation by psychrotolerant bacterial consortia
T2  - BIODEGRADATION
AB  - To probe the bioavailability of soot released into the atmosphere is pivotal to understanding their environmental impacts. Soot aerosol absorbs organic matter, creating a hot spot for biogeochemical transformation and the global carbon cycle. Soot primarily contains condensed aromatics chemically recalcitrant; however, oligotrophic microorganisms might use it as a nutritional source. This study investigated the influence of psychrotolerant bacterial consortia on soot. Significant increase in the bacterial biomass, reduction in water-insoluble organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) in soot residues and increase in water-soluble OC in the filtrate signifies the use of soot as a carbon and nutritional source. The influence on morphology and composition of soot was reported using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy, and Energy Dispersive X-Ray analysis (EDX). The FTIR analysis showed significant variations in the pattern of soot spectra, suggesting degradation. Elemental analysis and EDX showed a reduction in carbon percentage. Besides, the reduction of optical density with incubation time signifies the OC and EC consumption. This study shows that soot can be a substrate and pivotal factor in the microbial food web. Nowadays, soot emission to the environment is growing; therefore, soot involvement in microbe-mediated processes should be closely focused.

Determining the distribution and abundance of comammox in various environments is important for revealing the ecology of microbial nitrification within the global nitrogen cycle. In this study, the ubiquity and diversity of comammox were analyzed for samples from different types of environments, including soil, sediment, sludge, and water. The results of a two-step PCR using highly degenerate primers (THDP-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) supported the relatively high abundance of comammox in nearly half of all samples tested, sometimes even outnumbering canonical ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In addition, a relatively high proportion of comammox in tap and coastal water samples was confirmed via analysis of metagenomic data sets in public databases. The diversity of comammox was estimated by comammox-specific partial nested PCR amplification of the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene, and phylogenetic analysis of comammox AmoA clearly showed a split of clade A into clades A.1 and A.2, with the proportions of clades A.1, A.2, and B differing among the various environmental samples. Moreover, compared to the amoA genes of AOB and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), the comammox amoA gene exhibited higher diversity indices. The ubiquitous distribution and high diversity of comammox indicate that they are likely overlooked contributors to nitrification in various ecosystems.
   IMPORTANCE The discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox), which oxidize ammonia to nitrate via nitrite, refutes the century-old paradigm that nitrification requires the activity of two types of microbes and redefines a key process in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. Understanding the functional relationships between comammox and other nitrifiers is important for ecological studies on the nitrogen cycle. Therefore, the diversity and contribution of comammox should be considered during ecological analyses of nitrifying microorganisms. In this study, a ubiquitous and highly diverse distribution of comammox was observed in various environmental samples, similar to the distribution of canonical ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The proportion of comammox was relatively high in coastal water and sediment samples, whereas it was nearly undetectable in open-ocean samples. The ubiquitous distribution and high diversity of comammox indicate that these microorganisms might be important contributors to nitrification.

TI  - Artificial reforestation produces less diverse soil nitrogen-cycling genes than natural restoration
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Reforestation is effective in restoring ecosystem functions and enhancing ecosystem services of degraded land. The three most commonly employed reforestation methods of natural reforestation, artificial reforestation with native Masson pine, and introduced slash pine plantations were equally successful in biomass yield in southern China. However, it is not known whether soil ecosystem functions, such as nitrogen (N) cycling, are also successfully restored. Here, we employed a functional microarray to illustrate soil N-cycling. The composition of N-cycling genes in soils varied significantly with reforestation method and varied with constructive species identity and plant diversity. Artificial reforestation had less superior organization of N-cycling genes than natural reforestation, as indicated by the less diverse and less stable pathways to perform the biogeochemical N-cycling processes. Besides, artificial reforestation had lower functional potential (abundance of ammonification, denitrification, assimilatory, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium genes) in soils than natural method. Evaluations of the abundance and interactions of N-cycling genes in soils showed that plantations, especially artificial reforestation with slash pine plantations, possessed a smaller range of ecosystem functions that provide a less diverse array of N-related substrates and nutrients to microbial communities compared with natural restoration. This might lead to a lower independence of N-cycling, which indicated a higher risk of N release in plantations. The unfavorable N-cycling conditions in plantations were corroborated by the lower contents of available N, ammonium N, and nitrate N. These findings demonstrate that reforestation methods could have broad regional and possibly global implications for N-cycling.

TI  - Can the labile carbon contribute to carbon immobilization in semiarid soils? Priming effects and microbial community dynamics
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Tracer experiments with isotopic-enriched carbon compounds can provide information regarding the carbon cycling in semiarid soils. We studied priming effects and microbial utilization of glucose as an example of bioavailable labile molecule in the carbon cycle of a semiarid soil. The soil, which has low content of total organic carbon (5.0 g kg(-1)), was amended with (UC)-C-13-glucose (99 atom %) at concentration of 75 mu g C g(-1) soil (LD) or 300 mu g C g(-1) soil (HD). Glucose-derived carbon remained in soil after two months of incubation. The percentage of residual carbon stabilized was greater in LD with 40% of the initial C-13 added compared to 30% of the initial C-13 added in the HD. Comparison of C-13 content in water- and sodium-pyrophosphate extracts pointed to a significant humification of up to 2.4% of the initial C-13-glucose. Glucose was subjected to an intense mineralization in the first 17-days of 22.8% and 40.94% for the ID and HD, respectively. The stable isotope probing (SIP) of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) by gas-chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS) showed that bacteria dominated glucose metabolism in comparison to fungi. Gram-negative populations were Initially more involved in glucose assimilation than Gram-positive bacteria. In the fatty acids fraction, up to 95% of the C-13 was predominantly found in fatty acids typical for Gram-negative bacteria. However, after 4 and 17 days the C-13-enrichment in Gram-positive biomarkers increased. The mineralization of soil organic matter triggered by glucose additions was more intense in HD (3.6% of soil TOC) than LD (1.0% of soil TOC) and reached the highest level after 4 days in HD. Priming was controlled by Gram-negative populations but fungi and, particularly actinobacteria played an important role in latter steps. Our data indicated that the intense metabolism of SOM due to priming phenomena compromises the potential carbon sequestration in this semiarid soil amended with glucose. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Successive hexaconazole application altered the degradation behavior in soil and shifted microbial community and functional profiles
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - High-frequency and high-dose application of the fungicide hexaconazole has caused the accumulated residues in agricultural soils. However, the degradation behaviors of hexaconazole and the ecological risks associated with its successive applications remain unknown. This study aimed to explore the degradation characteristics of hexaconazole in soil and its effects on soil microbial community structure and function under successive application conditions. The resulted showed that biodegradation was the primary pathway for hexaconazole degradation in soil. The degradation half-life (DT50) of hexaconazole in soil were 18.7-67.3 days, initially increasing and then decreasing with successive applications. Higher concentration significantly prolonged the DT50. Hexaconazole application significantly reduced soil microbial functional diversity as increasing treatment frequency. Successive applications altered the soil bacterial community composition and promoted the proliferation of 13 potential hexaconazole-degrading bacterial genera, including Methylibium and Variovorax. Moreover, these bacterial genera acted as biomarkers of hexaconazole treatment and were distributed in a same functional module in the bacterial network. While most soil microbial metabolic pathways were inhibited, a few, such as those related to cellular community-prokaryotes and cell motility, were stimulated. Notably, successive applications disrupted soil nitrogen cycling, especially suppressing the expression of key nitrification and denitrification genes, including AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, and nirK. This study provides insights into the hexaconazole degradation in soil and highlights the ecological risks associated with its frequency application.

TI  - Effect of Nigella sativa Residue and Its Biochar on Soil Microbial Activity, Carbon Sequestration and Nitrogen Cycling Across Different Soil Types
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study aimed to assess the effects of black cumin (Nigella sativa) residue and its biochar on soil microbial activity, carbon sequestration and nitrogen cycling in three soil types: Alfisol, Entisol and Mollisol. A 120-day incubation experiment was conducted to evaluate changes in soluble carbon (SC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soluble nitrogen (SN), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), CO2 emissions, carbon use efficiency (CUE) and metabolic coefficient (qCO(2)), calculated to understand microbial functionality and carbon retention. The results revealed that biochar (BC) enhanced long-term carbon stabilisation, while black cumin residue increased microbial activity and short-term nutrient turnover. In the BC2 treatment, SC remained stable until day 120 (419.2 mg/kg), suggesting sustained carbon availability. The highest MBC (528 mg kg(-1)) and lowest CO2 emissions were also recorded under biochar treatments, reflecting improved microbial efficiency. Significant interactions (p < 0.001) were observed between soil type, treatment and sampling time. These findings suggest that the combined use of biochar and plant residues can enhance both immediate microbial responses and long-term soil health, offering a sustainable strategy for soil fertility improvement and carbon management across different soil systems.

TI  - Water Level Has Higher Influence on Soil Organic Carbon and Microbial Community in Poyang Lake Wetland Than Vegetation Type
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Although microorganisms play a key role in the carbon cycle of the Poyang Lake wetland, the relationship between soil microbial community structure and organic carbon characteristics is unknown. Herein, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to explore the effects of water level (low and high levels above the water table) and vegetation types (Persicaria hydropiper and Triarrhena lutarioriparia) on microbial community characteristics in the Poyang Lake wetland, and the relationships between soil microbial and organic carbon characteristics were revealed. The results showed that water level had a significant effect on organic carbon characteristics, and that soil total nitrogen, organic carbon, recombinant organic carbon, particle organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon were higher at low levels above the water table. A positive correlation was noted between soil water content and organic carbon characteristics. Water level and vegetation type significantly affected soil bacterial and fungal diversity, with water level exerting a higher effect than vegetation type. The impacts of water level and vegetation type were higher on fungi than on bacteria. The bacterial diversity and evenness were significantly higher at high levels above the water table, whereas an opposite trend was noted among fungi. The bacterial and fungal richness in T. lutarioriparia community soil was higher than that in P. hydropiper community soil. Although both water level and vegetation type had significant effects on bacterial and fungal community structures, the water level had a higher impact than vegetation type. The bacterial and fungal community changes were the opposite at different water levels but remained the same in different vegetation soils. The organic carbon characteristics of wetland soil were negatively correlated with bacterial diversity but positively correlated with fungal diversity. Soil water content, soluble organic carbon, C/N, and microbial biomass carbon were the key soil factors affecting the wetland microbial community. Acidobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Eurotiomycetes were the key microbiota affecting the soil carbon cycle in the Poyang Lake wetland. Thus, water and carbon sources were the limiting factors for bacteria and fungi in wetlands with low soil water content (30%). Hence, the results provided a theoretical basis for understanding the microbial-driven mechanism of the wetland carbon cycle.

TI  - Characteristics of soil nitrogen and nitrogen cycling microbial communities in different alfalfa planting years
T2  - ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Nitrogen cycling in soil and its microbial community characteristics are closely related. Characteristics of soil nitrogen, community diversity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) and ammonia oxidizers were study with a traditional farmland as control and five treatment alfalfa fields of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year (a) cultivation. The results showed that total nitrogen (TN) significantly increased in 3, 4 and 5 a, alkali-hydrolysable nitrogen (AHN), NH4+-N (AN), NO3--N (NN) and SOC was the highest in 3, 5, 3, 4 a, respectively. The dominant phylum of NFB and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) belonged to Proteobacteria with a higher diversity and abundance in 3 and 4 a. Crenarchaeota was found the dominant phylum of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) with the highest abundance in the alfalfa field planted for 2 a. The dominant genus of NFB and AOB were Azohydromonas and Nitrosospira, respectively, which showed the highest abundance in the alfalfa fields planted for 2 and 3 a, respectively. The diversity of NFB and AOB showed a significantly positive correlation with TN and AHN (p < 0.05). AOA showed a significantly negative correlation with AN (p < 0.05). Many microbial species cannot be annotated in this study, which deserves future investigation.

TI  - Priming Effect and Respiratory Quotient in a Forest Soil Amended with Glucose
T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Soil respiration is a key process in global carbon cycling. Therefore, the response of respiration, carbon isotopic characteristic of the CO(2) evolved and the respiratory quotient, defined as the ratio of mol CO(2) evolution per mol O(2) uptake, was studied for beech forest topsoil after low to high addition of the readily available C4-plant derived glucose. The low glucose rate that corresponded to the 2-week C input by root exudates and plant residues in the field stimulated respiration for 1 day only. The 10-fold higher rate of 500 g glucose-C g(-1) soil increased respiration for about 1 week and the highest rate of 2000 mu g glucose-C g(-1) soil, which corresponds to the typical rate of the microbial biomass method by substrate-induced respiration induced more than 4-week stimulated respiration. When the respiration rates have returned to the control level, the carbon isotopic characteristic of the CO(2) evolved indicated that the CO(2) is still derived from glucose metabolites. We concluded that priming effect of the C3-plant derived soil organic matter and soil respiratory quotient value were increased simultaneously and effects were correlated to the glucose rate.

TI  - Variation in enzyme activities involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling in rhizosphere and bulk soil after organic mulching
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
AB  - Organic mulching provides C and N source to the soil, changing the soil environment and promoting plant growth. Soil enzymes play important roles in soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. However, changes in enzyme activity after organic mulching in urban forest ecosystems remain poorly understood, especially in rhizosphere soil. In this study, the effects of organic mulching on the activity levels of enzymes relevant to C and N in the rhizosphere and bulk soil were investigated in a 15-year-old Ligustrum lucidum urban forest. Invertase activity increased whereas urease activity decreased after organic mulching. Changes in peroxidase and dehydrogenase activity varied across seasons; these changes were greater and lasted longer than changes in invertase and urease activity because of the stronger organic matter decomposition via microbial action and soil substance cycling and transformation in a short period of time after organic mulching. Enzyme activity in the rhizosphere significantly correlated with that in bulk soil (P < 0.01), though the former was more affected by mulching due to the influence of accelerated root element cycling. Enzyme activity levels were significantly correlated with dissolved C, available N, and microbial biomass C and N, but not with soil organic C or total N. Enzyme activities were also affected by physical factors, such as soil temperature and water content. Frequent applications of small quantities of organic mulch may be conducive to soil improvement. Further longterm comprehensive studies, considering the effects of season and soil layer, are required to elucidate the effects and underlying mechanisms of organic mulching on the soil environment in forest ecosystems.

TI  - Species interactions and distinct microbial communities in high Arctic permafrost affected cryosols are associated with the CH4 and CO2 gas fluxes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Microbial metabolism of the thawing organic carbon stores in permafrost results in a positive feedback loop of greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 and CH4 fluxes and the associated microbial communities in Arctic cryosols are important in predicting future warming potential of the Arctic. We demonstrate that topography had an impact on CH4 and CO2 flux at a high Arctic ice-wedge polygon terrain site, with higher CO2 emissions and lower CH4 uptake at troughs compared to polygon interior soils. The pmoA sequencing suggested that USC alpha cluster of uncultured methanotrophs is likely responsible for observed methane sink. Community profiling revealed distinct assemblages across the terrain at different depths. Deeper soils contained higher abundances of Verrucomicrobia and Gemmatimonadetes, whereas the polygon interior had higher Acidobacteria and lower Betaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria abundances. Genome sequencing of isolates from the terrain revealed presence of carbon cycling genes including ones involved in serine and ribulose monophosphate pathways. A novel hybrid network analysis identified key members that had positive and negative impacts on other species. Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with numerous positive interactions corresponded to Proteobacteria, Candidatus Rokubacteria and Actinobacteria phyla, while Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria members had negative impacts on other species. Results indicate that topography and microbial interactions impact community composition.

TI  - Sunlight-hematite promoted denitrification by Pseudomonas aeruginosa: A little-known form of nitrogen-cycling enhancement
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Microorganism-mineral interactions are widely involved in material circulation and energy flow processes in the Earth's surface system and have attracted extensive attention in recent years. Here, sunlight-hematite-promoted denitrification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 was observed. Under illumination, the nitrate removal rate reached 90.49 +/- 4.40%, which is 1.3-times higher than that in darkness (69.36 +/- 1.96%). Moreover, different concentration of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and hematite showed good synergy, suggesting that enhanced denitrifica-tion processes are common. Amperometric I-t curves indicate that P. aeruginosa PAO1 generated the highest current density (3.4 +/- 0.23 mu A/cm2) with hematite under illumination, while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the charge transfer resistance RP increased from 144 omega to 162 omega when nitrate was added, indicating that there is another electron transfer pathway in the light-hematite-P. aeruginosa PAO1 system. To better understand this phenomenon in nature, experiments were conducted with red soil in place of hematite. A similarly enhanced nitrate removal rate (89.17%) was observed, confirming that this synergistic process occurs in nature. This research demonstrates a neglected denitrification model in a sun-light-semiconducting mineral-microorganism system, which expands our understanding of nitrogen cycling in natural environments.

TI  - Diversity and distribution of CO2-fixing microbial community along elevation gradients in meadow soils on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Soil CO2-fixing microbes play a significant role in CO2-fixation in the terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in the Tibetan Plateau. To understand carbon sequestration by soil CO2-fixing microbes and the carbon cycling in alpine meadow soils, microbial diversity and their driving environmental factors were explored along an elevation gradient from 3900 to 5100 m, on both east and west slopes of Mila Mountain region on the Tibetan Plateau. The CO2-fixing microbial communities were characterized by high-throughput sequencing targeting the cbbL gene, encoding the large subunit for the CO2-fixing protein ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. The overall OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) abundance is concentrated at an altitude between 4300 and 4900 m. The diversity of CO2-fixing microbes is the highest in the middle altitude area, and on the east slope is higher than those on the west slope. In terms of microbial community composition, Proteobacteria is dominant, and the most abundant genera are Cupriavidus, Rhodobacter, Sulfurifustis and Thiobacillus. Altitude has the greatest influence on the structural characteristics of CO2-fixing microbes, and other environmental factors are significantly correlated with altitude. Therefore, altitude influences the structural characteristics of CO2-fixing microbes by driving environmental factors. Our results are helpful to understand the variation in soil microbial community and its role in soil carbon cycling along elevation gradients.

TI  - Nitrogen functional profiles of microbiomes in diverse agricultural and forest soils and its driver at continental scale in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Functional characteristics of microbiomes are good predictors of nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry, but soil microbial N-functional profiles under different land use practices and their dominant drivers at continental scale remain unclear. For this study, we selected soils having a broad range of edaphic factors across different land use practices and soil types in China and used metagenomic sequencing to investigate N-functional profiles of microbiomes. The N-pathway frequencies were highest in paddy soils, and the composition of N-cycling genes in paddy soils significantly diverged from upland and forest soils. Differential abundance analysis showed that genes associated with nitrogen dissimilatory pathways exhibited enrichment in paddy soils, whereas those linked to assimilatory pathways were enriched in forest soils. Aggregated boosted tree analysis revealed that the frequencies of N-pathways and relative abundances of N-cycling genes were mainly explained by soil moisture and pH. Partial Mantel and redundancy analysis consistently showed that N-functional composition correlated strongest with moisture and pH. Overall, our results demonstrated that soil moisture and pH were vital drivers of microbial N-functional profiles, providing novel evidence for soil moisture and pH's role in driving whole nitrogen cycling. Considering the large fluctuations in moisture over time, soil pH, with minor seasonality, could be used as indicators to reflect microbial N-functional profiles at the continental scale.

TI  - Global response of soil phosphatase activity to land reclamation and vegetation restoration
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Phosphatase activity plays a significant role in soil phosphorus (P) cycling, supporting plant growth and maintaining soil health, yet agricultural-driven land use changes have substantially regulated its activity. However, the global impact of land reclamation and vegetation restoration on phosphatase activity remains unclear. This study conducted a meta-analysis using 851 observations of phosphatases from 201 publications to explore the response of phosphatase activity to land reclamation and vegetation restoration. Land reclamation significantly inhibited soil acid (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities by 28.94 % and 22.95 %, while vegetation restoration increased ACP and ALP activities by 46.10 % and 68.17 %. Phosphatase activity in forests was more influenced by land use change than in grasslands. The decreases in ACP activities from forest to cropland (- 33.25 %) were significantly greater than those from grassland to cropland (-20.11 %). Phosphatase activities were positively correlated with vegetation restoration years (P < 0.05), but not with land reclamation years (P > 0.05). Notably, during land reclamation, phosphatase activity was mainly driven by soil total nitrogen, organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon, whereas, mean annual temperature precipitation played a larger role in determining phosphatase activity during vegetation restoration. Our research suggests that land reclamation can weaken phosphorus cycling function, but targeted vegetation restoration measures, especially long-term restoration, can reverse these negative impacts. Our results highlight that it is crucial to use sustainable agricultural measures and incentivize climate adaptive land management to ensure long-term soil productivity and improve overall soil health. These findings emphasize the significant and variable influences of environmental factors on soil phosphatase activity across various land use patterns, providing valuable insights for land management and ecological restoration.

TI  - Responses of bacterial communities to microplastics: More sensitive in less fertile soils
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Recently, the potential impact of microplastics (MPs) on bacterial communities has risen enormously attention due to the increasing amount of plastic waste generated nowadays. However, there is a lack of clarity due to limited studies on the responses of bacterial communities to MPs exposures in various soil ecosystems. Here, we conducted a soil microcosm ex-periment to analyze the potential impact of MPs on bacterial communities in farmland soil, forest soil, and sandy soil. The changes in alpha/beta diversity and co-occurrence network of bacterial communities were more significant in farmland soil amended with PS MPs (5 g kg-1), forest soil amended with PP MPs (5 g kg-1), and sandy soil amended with PP MPs (1 g kg-1). Particularly, the bacterial communities in sandy soil with the least soil organic carbon content were dis-turbed most significantly compared to other treatments. LEfSe analysis revealed that specific bacterial taxa such as phylum Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and genus Sphingomonas, Candidatus Udaeobacter, Gemmatimonas, were sensitive to MPs exposures. Functional annotation showed that perturbation of bacterial communities was related to organic carbon decomposition, nitrogen fixation, nitrate reduction/respiration, etc. In sum, MPs may potentially affect bacterial commu-nity structure and functions relevant to carbon/nitrogen cycles at long-term realistic field exposure.

TI  - Long-term partial substitution of chemical fertilizer by organic amendments influences soil microbial functional diversity of phosphorus cycling and improves phosphorus availability in greenhouse vegetable production
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Substitution of chemical fertilizers with organic amendments is an important practice for promoting soil phos-phorus (P) transformation and alleviating excessive P accumulation in greenhouse vegetable production, yet little research has comprehensively investigated the effects on functional traits of P cycling microorganisms. Here, we integrated metagenomics and genome binning to explore 24 soil microbial P cycling traits in a 10-year field experiment including four treatments (equal NPK input): chemical fertilizer (CC), half of chemical N substituted with manure (CM), straw (CS), or manure plus straw (CMS). Compared with the CC treatment, organic substitution fertilization (CM, CS, and CMS) increased microbial taxonomic and functional diversity. Among P cycling-related genes, organic substitution fertilization significantly reduced the relative abundance of the phoU and increased the absolute abundance of gcd, ppx, and phoD (fluorescence quantitative PCR). Among microbial taxa containing gcd and phoD genes, organic substitution fertilization significantly increased the abundance of Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, which were the most important predictors of soil Olsen P. Long-term organic substitution fertilization increased the microbial P solubilization and mineralization capacity by increasing soil C:P and N:P ratios and decreasing the pH. The gcd, ppx and phoD genes were positively correlated with labile P and Olsen P. The 12 reconstructed bacterial genomes harbored P solubilization genes, and the abundances of most genomes were higher under organic substitution fertilization than under CC treatment. Overall, organic substitution fertilization mainly increased the microbial P solubilization and mineralization capacity for P availability and also promoted microbial P immobilization, reducing losses to the environment in greenhouse vegetable production.

TI  - Climate warming restructures seasonal dynamics of grassland soil microbial communities
T2  - MLIFE
AB  - Soil microbial community's responses to climate warming alter the global carbon cycle. In temperate ecosystems, soil microbial communities function along seasonal cycles. However, little is known about how the responses of soil microbial communities to warming vary when the season changes. In this study, we investigated the seasonal dynamics of soil bacterial community under experimental warming in a temperate tall-grass prairie ecosystem. Our results showed that warming significantly (p = 0.001) shifted community structure, such that the differences of microbial communities between warming and control plots increased nonlinearly (R-2 = 0.578, p = 0.021) from spring to winter. Also, warming significantly (p < 0.050) increased microbial network complexity and robustness, especially during the colder seasons, despite large variations in network size and complexity in different seasons. In addition, the relative importance of stochastic processes in shaping the microbial community decreased by warming in fall and winter but not in spring and summer. Our study indicates that climate warming restructures the seasonal dynamics of soil microbial community in a temperate ecosystem. Such seasonality of microbial responses to warming may enlarge over time and could have significant impacts on the terrestrial carbon cycle.

TI  - Landscape management alters relationships between edaphic conditions, bacterial diversities, and nitrogen-cycling traits
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Urbanization has dramatic effects on riparian ecosystem functioning. China implemented ecological restoration through the landscape construction of riverside green spaces. Soil microbiome restoration is key to the recovery of riverside ecosystem functioning. However, it remains unknown how restoration strategies affect biodiversity-function relationship. Here we examined bacterial communities and functional profiles using high-throughput sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction in adjacent pairs of landscaped and undeveloped riparian green spaces. We also explored how soil properties, bacterial communities, and functions interact using structural equation modeling. Results showed that the landscaped system had higher soil nutrients and moisture, and more uniform bacterial alpha and beta diversity than the undeveloped system. Landscaped systems harbored more abundant denitrification genes, while undeveloped systems had more abundant nitrification genes. In the landscaped system, bacterial alpha diversity is independent of soil factors and negatively correlated with multiple nitrogen-cycling processes. In resource-limited undeveloped system, bacterial alpha diversity negatively responded to soil nutrients, but positively affected nitrification. Moreover, soil nutrients negatively and positively impacted denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), respectively in the undeveloped system. In the landscaped system, high soil moisture promoted denitrification and anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation), which contributed to nitrogen loss. Collectively, landscape management influenced bacterial diversity, function, and their relationship by altering soil resource.

TI  - Presence of microplastics alone and co-existence with hydrochar unexpectedly mitigate ammonia volatilization from rice paddy soil and affect structure of soil microbiome
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastics (MPs), as an emerging pollutant, may cause deleterious changes to the nitrogen cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. However, single impact of MPs and synergistic effects of MPs with hydrochar on ammonia (NH3) volatilization and soil microbiome in paddy fields has been largely unexplored. In this study, polyethylene (PE), polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and straw-derived hydrochar (HBC) were selected for observations in an entire rice cycle growth period. Results showed that under the condition of 0.5% (w/w) MPs concentration, presence of MPs alone and co-existence of MPs and HBC (MPs + HBC) unexpectedly mitigated cumulative NH3 volatilization from paddy soil compared with the control with no MPs or HBC addition. MPs + HBC increased NH3 volatilization by 37.8-46.2% compared with MPs alone, indicating that co-existence of MPs and HBC weaken the mitigation effect of MPs on NH3 volatilization. Additionally, results of nitrogen cycle related microorganisms closely related to NH3 volatilization demonstrated that MPs + HBC altered the bacterial community structure and species diversity. These findings provide an important opportunity to advance our understanding of the impacts of MPs in agricultural environment and soils, and provide a sound theoretical basis for rationalizing the application of HBC in soil with MPs.

Different from methylotrophic bacteria, methylotrophic methanogens assimilate both, the methyl compound and dissolved inorganic carbon.

TI  - Hydrologic history influences microbial community composition and nitrogen cycling under experimental drying/wetting treatments
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Understanding how historical and contemporary environmental conditions interact to affect the relationship between community structure and function is necessary to predict the response of microbial community function to a changing environment. We focused on nitrogen transformations - denitrification and nitrification - which directly impact nitrate concentration in wetland ecosystems. Nitrate removal can occur via denitrification, while nitrate can be generated through nitrification; these two microbial transformations are strongly influenced by hydrology and redox conditions. We carried out a manipulative mesocosm experiment to determine how microbial communities adapted to different hydrologic conditions (upland vs. wetland) respond to experimental soil moisture treatments (dry, wet-dry, saturated). We assessed local soil characteristics (e.g., soil moisture, inorganic nitrogen), and microbial community composition and activity of denitrifiers and ammonia oxidizers (targeted by the nosZ and amoA genes, respectively) before and after moisture treatments. Wetland soils were characterized by higher soil fertility compared to upland soils. In response to the drying/flooding treatments, we observed a small but significant change in community composition of denitrifier assemblages, but no change in the ammonia oxidizer communities. In addition, potential denitrification rates significantly increased under wetter conditions (upland: 62-118% increase; wetland: 78-96% increase), whereas potential nitrification rates generally showed no significant change following experimental drying/flooding treatments, regardless of the hydrologic history. Based on these results, fluctuations in soil moisture are expected to influence denitrification rates to a greater extent than nitrification rates, ultimately influencing nitrate pools in this wetland. This imbalance in microbial functional response may result in a shift in dominant nitrogen cycling transformations within a wetland as a consequence of the different responses of these nitrogen-cycling functional guilds to changes in soil moisture. A shift in nitrogen transformations can be most noticeable under fluctuating hydrologic conditions, and there is potential for the wetland to be resilient to hydrologic change if soil microbes are exposed to dynamic hydrology over the long-term.

TI  - Protist Predation Influences the Temperature Response of Bacterial Communities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Temperature strongly influences microbial community structure and function, in turn contributing to global carbon cycling that can fuel further warming. Recent studies suggest that biotic interactions among microbes may play an important role in determining the temperature responses of these communities. However, how predation regulates these microbiomes under future climates is still poorly understood. Here, we assess whether predation by a key global bacterial consumer-protists-influences the temperature response of the community structure and function of a freshwater microbiome. To do so, we exposed microbial communities to two cosmopolitan protist species-Tetrahymena thermophila and Colpidium sp.-at two different temperatures, in a month-long microcosm experiment. While microbial biomass and respiration increased with temperature due to community shifts, these responses changed over time and in the presence of protists. Protists influenced microbial biomass and respiration rate through direct and indirect effects on bacterial community structure, and predator presence actually reduced microbial respiration at elevated temperature. Indicator species analyses showed that these predator effects were mostly determined by phylum-specific bacterial responses to protist density and cell size. Our study supports previous findings that temperature is an important driver of microbial communities but also demonstrates that the presence of a large predator can mediate these responses to warming.

TI  - Porewater exchange drives nutrient cycling and export in a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - Coastal wetlands regulate nutrient fluxes from the continents to the oceans. Salt marshes are rapidly encroaching into mudflat area in mangrove wetlands, shaping a mangrove-salt marsh ecotone, with unknown implications to coastal biogeochemical cycles. Here, we hypothesized that nitrogen and phosphorus cycling varied in mangrove and salt marsh, having significant implication on coastal waters. We investigated a tidal creek with a marked mangrove-salt marsh gradient in China using high-frequency time-series sampling of dissolved nutrients and observations of porewater exchange rate across the sediment-water interface over a spring-neap tidal cycle. The nitrogen transformation rates and microbiological activities were also investigated to explain the variability in nitrogen concentrations. The mangrove had net groundwater outflow rates of 3.6-4.3 mm d(-1) while the salt marsh had net infiltration of surface water with rates of 0.5-2.9 mm d(-1). Salt marsh had less capacity for ammonium (NH4-N) production (mineralization and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium DNRA) than mangrove. Denitrification dominated nitrogen removal reaching 97% and 83% in mangrove and salt marsh, respectively. Microbe distributions were consistent with nitrogen transformations with larger nirS and nrfA abundances for denitrification and DNRA in the mangrove than salt marsh. The mangrove had a net export of NH4-N but a net import of NOx-N (sum of nitrate and nitrite) and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) during the monitoring period. In contrast, the salt marsh had lower efflux of nutrient than influx leading to a net nutrient import during the monitoring period. Porewater released from the mangrove had a large DIN:DIP mole ratio (706 +/- 236) due to high NH4-N concentrations, while NH4-N in the salt marsh were lower than in the mangrove. Overall, this study revealed that mangrove-salt marsh ecotone will push the native mangrove wetlands from being a source towards a sink of NH4-N to coastal waters by decreasing porewater exchange, modifying the nutrients stoichiometry, and ultimately alleviating the potential of N-associated eutrophication in nearby coastal waters.

TI  - Rapid peptide metabolism: A major component of soil nitrogen cycling?
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
AB  - Proteinaceous and peptidic nitrogen is a potential direct nutrient source for both plants and microbes in the soil, without prior degradation to amino acids and mineralization. We used a series of five sites along an elevation gradient from 15 m a.s.l. to 710 m a.s.l. along which primary productivity decreases to investigate peptide utilization rates by soil microbes. Using C-14-labeled L-alanine, L-dialanine, and L-trialanine in a series of incubation experiments, we show that peptides are directly and rapidly assimilated by soil microbes, and that they are utilized for both biomass production and respiration. Alanine, dialanine, and trialanine were mineralized rapidly by soil microbes from the five sites along the gradient. Across all five sites, dialanine and trialanine were mineralized faster than alanine. In competition experiments, a 100-fold excess of alanine had no effect on the rate of trialanine mineralization in four of the five sites, and the same excess of trialanine had no effect on alanine mineralization. This is indicative of uptake of the intact peptide by the soil microbial community. Our findings have implications for understanding terrestrial nitrogen cycling because they point to a short-circuit whereby large peptides and proteins need only be extracellularly cleaved to short chain length peptides before direct assimilation by microbes.

TI  - Soil properties and anthropogenic influences control the distribution of soil organic carbon in grasslands of northern China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) in grasslands not only plays an important role in carbon cycle but also largely affects soil function and thus determines grasslands' productivity. However, the influence mechanism of different factors on SOC storage in grasslands of northern China remains unclear. Based on an extensive field investigation and multiple statistical approaches, we mapped SOC of the grassland in northern China, and explored their correlations with climatic factors, biological factors, human activity intensity (HAI), and soil physicochemical factors. The effects of these factors on SOC were also analyzed by structural equation model. The results showed that the SOC varied across the regions and was strongly correlated with soil chemical factors (i.e., soil total nitrogen [TN], amorphous Al, and amorphous Fe) and soil physical factors (i.e., clay, silt, and sand). HAI, which was mainly influenced by grazing, had a significant but negative impact on SOC. Different from previous studies, we found that climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation indirectly affected SOC by influencing biological factors such as vegetation coverage, vegetation height, Shannon-Weiner index, and species richness. The soil physicochemical properties and HAI were the dominant influencing factors for controlling SOC distribution in the grasslands of northern China. Our findings will further increase the understanding of the carbon cycle in grassland ecosystems, while providing important scientific references for temperate grassland ecosystem management.

TI  - Changes in carbon inputs affect soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity in a broadleaved forest in central China
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Soil respiration, as an important process in global carbon cycle, is drastically stimulated by warming. Changing plant carbon inputs caused by intensified human disturbances and climate change can complexly influence soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity (Q(10)). Although a number of experiments have been established in the world to explore the effects of changing carbon inputs, it remains a challenge to predict the direction and magnitude of changes in soil respiration and Q(10) due to high spatiotemporal variability of climatic zone and ecosystem. Therefore, we conducted a field manipulative experiment to examine the impact of litter removal and root exclusion on soil respiration and Q(10) in a deciduous broad-leaved forest in transition zone between subtropical and warm temperate zone. The results showed that litter removal significantly reduced soil respiration, microbial biomass carbon, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and soil moisture. In addition, litter removal altered soil microbial community composition, expressed in increase of Gram-positive / Gram-negative bacteria ratio and percentage of actinomycetes, and enhanced microbial physiological stress index. Root exclusion significantly increased Q(10) by elevating soil C/N ratio, which supporting "C quality-temperature " hypothesis. The study indicates that root exclusion may accelerate soil respiration under warming. Our study provides insights to improve carbon cycling models and accurately predict the consequences of climate change.

TI  - Impacts of graphitic nanofertilizers on nitrogen cycling in a sandy, agricultural soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF NANOPARTICLE RESEARCH
AB  - Graphene nanofertilizers have demonstrated immense potential in improving agricultural productivity and nitrogen management. However, how those nanomaterials interact with soil microbial communities related to N cycle remain unclear. The present study assessed the impact of four different graphitic nanomaterials (i.e., GO, graphene oxide; rGO, reduced graphene oxide; GNP, graphene nanoplatelet; GNA, graphite nanoadditive) and biochar at two different doses (5 and 1000 mg kg(-1) soil) on soil respiration, nitrification potential, and microbial N cycling functional genes over 28 days of incubation of sandy agricultural soil. Basal respiration indicated a transient increase of microbial activity with all treatments, while substrate induced respiration (SIR) revealed an enhancement of microbial respiration rate with some treatments that sustained at the end of the incubation. No significant differences in the maximum nitrification potential were observed when treated with GNMs or biochar. However, decreased abundances of amoA genes and increased abundance of denitrifying genes (nirK, nirS, nosZ) in all treated soils suggested a decreased potential for nitrification and boosted denitrification after 28-day exposure. In addition, GNMs showed minimum impact on nifH population in this incubation study. Together, the results suggest that graphitic nanomaterials might suppress nitrification and potentially reduce losses by nitrate leaching in agricultural soils.

TI  - The response of soil respiration to land-use change depends on soil microbial community being regulated by edaphic factors in the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Land-use change has significant influences on soil respiration (Rs) in terrestrial ecosystems. Soil microbes play critical roles in soil carbon cycling. Nevertheless, the specific mechanism of how changes in soil microbial properties are linked to the variation of Rs rate during land-use change still remains poorly understood, especially in the Loess Plateau, China. Here, the characteristics of Rs rate and soil microbial community following the land-use change from farmland to plantation/grassland were analyzed via an automated soil CO2 flux system and high-throughput 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The afforestation altered soil microbial diversity and community composition, which was mainly explained by soil pH, temperature, organic matter, nitrate, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen, and available phosphorus. The biomarkers of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Thaumarchaeota were found in farmland soil at the phylum level. The afforestation also significantly decreased Rs rate, which was closely related to Shannon's index, Simpson's index, and some microbial taxa, such as Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, and Acidobacteria. Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were particularly expected to be important drivers of high Rs rate in farmland soil. Moreover, the microbial interaction was probably also an important factor affecting Rs rate. Our results indicate that the response of Rs to land-use change depends on soil microbial community being regulated by soil physicochemical properties in the Loess Plateau, China.

TI  - MOLECULAR ASSESSMENT OF SOIL NITROGEN CYCLE UNDER ORGANIC AMENDMENTS IN COTTON BROAD-ACREAGE PRODUCTION
T2  - PERIODICO TCHE QUIMICA
AB  - Background: The cotton production belt in Australia covers vast areas from subtropical to temperate and grassland. Soil types are mostly different variations of clay, with mainly black, grey, and red clay soil containing variable proportions of sand. Growers often grow cotton in rotation with other crops, such as wheat, beans, and corn, and soil fertilization varies with a number of growers using organic amendments such as manure or compost before planting as a supplementary source of nutrients. Aim: The objective of this study is to understand the influence of various crop production management strategies on soil microbial communities and soil microbial function. Thus, it assists in improving the soil quality and sustaining crop production with high yields at a lower cost. Methods: To achieve the aim of this study, had been used qPCR to estimate the abundance of functional genes involving nitrogen-cycle ( nifH , ureC, nirS, nirK, nosZ as well as bacterial and archaeal amoA) genes in the soil. Results: It showed increased soil organic carbon compared to solely commercially fertilized soil. However, there were differences in the effects of compost and manure on soil organic carbon and nitrogen-cycling microbial communities. Compost-increased organic carbon pre-planting correlated with an increase in the nifH gene, whereas manure-amended soils sustained nifH abundance in the soil post-planting during seedling growth when nifH abundance decreased elsewhere. In contrast, the greatest abundance of ureolytic microbes carrying the ureC gene was found in inorganic urea-fertilized soil. Denitrification genes nirS, nirK, and nosZ were also more abundant in cotton soils receiving organic amendments. Bacterial and archaeal nitrifiers responded differently to compost and manure, with bacterial amoA abundance greater with manure supplementation and archaeal amoA greater with compost supplementation. Discussion: Organic amendment using mulch or manure as a supplement to commercial fertilization enhanced cotton soil prospects for microbial functions necessary for N input and output into the biosphere, particularly N fixation and denitrification. Conclusions: We concluded that greater soil organic carbon supported an increased potential for microbial functions essential for the input and output of nitrogen into the biosphere, namely nitrogen fixation and denitrification.

TI  - Elevation-dependent shifts in soil phosphorus forms and phosphorus-solubilizing microbial diversity suggest enhanced bioavailable phosphorus cycling with rising temperatures
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Phosphorus is a crucial nutrient for plant growth, primarily found as insoluble phosphates in soil. The impact of climate change on the phosphorus cycle, particularly through geochemical cycling in forest soils, is underexplored. To address this gap, we investigated soil phosphorus distribution across five elevation gradients in different forest types using the modified Hedley fractionation method and high-throughput sequencing to assess phosphorus-solubilizing microorganisms (PSMs). Our study included evergreen broadleaf forest, coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest, coniferous forest, subalpine dwarf forest, and alpine meadow. We observed that with increasing elevation, organic phosphorus forms such as NaOH-Po and HCl-Po significantly increased, while H2O-Po and NaHCO3-Po varied, peaking in specific forest types. The proportion of labile phosphorus decreased with elevation, whereas stable phosphorus increased. Soil PSM diversity was highest in lower elevations and declined with altitude, with significant shifts in dominant PSM groups across vegetation types. PSMs analysis revealed correlations between specific phosphorus forms and microbial taxa, indicating that elevation and vegetation type influence PSM diversity and phosphorus form distribution. The differences in soil conditions between low and high elevations present distinct characteristics: rapid mineral weathering and organic matter decomposition occur at lower elevations, while higher elevations exhibit higher total phosphorus content but a lower proportion of labile phosphorus. These distinctions open avenues for future research on adaptive strategies for phosphorus management in agriculture and forestry across different altitudes. These findings suggest that rising temperatures may enhance PSM diversity, potentially increasing the proportion of bioavailable phosphorus and accelerating its cycle in forest ecosystems.IMPORTANCEThis study provides critical insights into how climate change influences soil phosphorus cycling in forest ecosystems. By examining the distribution of phosphorus forms and the diversity of phosphorus-solubilizing microorganisms (PSMs) across different elevation gradients, we uncover how varying environmental conditions affect phosphorus availability. Our findings reveal that higher elevations, despite having increased total phosphorus content, exhibit reduced bioavailable phosphorus. This suggests that climate change, particularly rising temperatures, could enhance PSM diversity at lower elevations, potentially increasing phosphorus bioavailability and accelerating its cycle. These insights are crucial for developing adaptive phosphorus management strategies in agriculture and forestry, ensuring sustainable nutrient supply and improving ecosystem resilience in the face of global climate change. Understanding these dynamics helps predict future soil fertility patterns, aiding in the formulation of policies and practices aimed at maintaining healthy forest ecosystems and ensuring long-term ecosystem productivity under changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Metagenomics Unveils Microbial Diversity and Their Biogeochemical Roles in Water and Sediment of Thermokarst Lakes in the Yellow River Source Area
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Thermokarst lakes have long been recognized as biogeochemical hotspots, especially as sources of greenhouse gases. On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, thermokarst lakes are experiencing extensive changes due to faster warming. For a deep understanding of internal lake biogeochemical processes, we applied metagenomic analyses to investigate the microbial diversity and their biogeochemical roles in sediment and water of thermokarst lakes in the Yellow River Source Area (YRSA). Sediment microbial communities (SMCs) had lower species and gene richness than water microbial communities (WMCs). Bacteria were the most abundant component in both SMCs and WMCs with significantly different abundant genera. The functional analyses showed that both SMCs and WMCs had low potential in methanogenesis but strong in aerobic respiration, nitrogen assimilation, exopolyphosphatase, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases, and polyphosphate kinase. Moreover, SMCs were enriched in genes involved in anaerobic carbon fixation, aerobic carbon fixation, fermentation, most nitrogen metabolism pathways, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, sulfide oxidation, polysulfide reduction, 2-phosphonopropionate transporter, and phosphate regulation. WMCs were enriched in genes involved in assimilatory sulfate reduction, sulfur mineralization, phosphonoacetate hydrolase, and phosphonate transport. Functional potentials suggest the differences of greenhouse gas emission, nutrient cycling, and living strategies between SMCs and WMCs. This study provides insight into the main biogeochemical processes and their properties in thermokarst lakes in YRSA, improving our understanding of the roles and fates of these lakes in a warming world.

TI  - Microbial activity across a boreal peatland nutrient gradient: the role of fungi and bacteria
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Microbes involved in decomposition within peatlands and the conditions that influence their activities have implications for C and greenhouse gas exchange. The objectives of this research were to characterize the role of fungal and bacterial activities in peatlands using selective antibiotic inhibition techniques across a nutrient gradient (rich to poor fens) and to search for environmental controls on the activity of each group. Bacterial activities predominated across a range of rich to poor boreal peatlands in central Ontario, Canada, although fungal activity became increasingly important in the poor sites. Linkages between soil pH and nutrient status and fungal and bacterial activities were found. However, they did not confirm our initial hypotheses that bacterial activity would be low in poor sites due to proton stress and low nutrient (particularly N) availability, whereas, fungal activity would be low in rich sites due to increased competitive ability of bacteria under near neutral pH conditions and high nutrient availability. Further work across these sites aimed at characterizing the phylogeny of the rhizosphere fungi is needed to determine if increased presence of mycorrhizae in poor sites could have explained our observed patterns. However, regardless of fungal: bacterial activity ratio differences across sites and its associated controls, microbial CO2 production rates across fen types did not vary significantly, suggesting that the proportion of bacteria and fungi may not matter to broader carbon cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in peat soils.

TI  - Microbe-cellulose hydrogels as a model system for particulate carbon degradation in soil aggregates
T2  - ISME COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Particulate carbon (C) degradation in soils is a critical process in the global C cycle governing greenhouse gas fluxes and C storage. Millimeter-scale soil aggregates impose strong controls on particulate C degradation by inducing chemical gradients of e.g. oxygen, as well as limiting microbial mobility in pore structures. To date, experimental models of soil aggregates have incorporated porosity and chemical gradients but not particulate C. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept encapsulating microbial cells and particulate C substrates in hydrogel matrices as a novel experimental model for soil aggregates. Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum was co-encapsulated with cellulose in millimeter-scale polyethyleneglycol-dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) hydrogel beads. Microbial activity was delayed in hydrogel-encapsulated conditions, with cellulose degradation and fermentation activity being observed after 13 days of incubation. Unexpectedly, hydrogel encapsulation shifted product formation of R. cellulolyticum from an ethanol-lactate-acetate mixture to an acetate-dominated product profile. Fluorescence microscopy enabled simultaneous visualization of the PEGDMA matrix, cellulose particles, and individual cells in the matrix, demonstrating growth on cellulose particles during incubation. Together, these microbe-cellulose-PEGDMA hydrogels present a novel, reproducible experimental soil surrogate to connect single cells to process outcomes at the scale of soil aggregates and ecosystems.

TI  - Metaproteomics-informed stoichiometric modeling reveals the responses of wetland microbial communities to oxygen and sulfate exposure
T2  - NPJ BIOFILMS AND MICROBIOMES
AB  - Climate changes significantly impact greenhouse gas emissions from wetland soil. Specifically, wetland soil may be exposed to oxygen (O2) during droughts, or to sulfate (SO42-) as a result of sea level rise. How these stressors - separately and together - impact microbial food webs driving carbon cycling in the wetlands is still not understood. To investigate this, we integrated geochemical analysis, proteogenomics, and stoichiometric modeling to characterize the impact of elevated SO42- and O2 levels on microbial methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The results uncovered the adaptive responses of this community to changes in SO42- and O2 availability and identified altered microbial guilds and metabolic processes driving CH4 and CO2 emissions. Elevated SO42- reduced CH4 emissions, with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis more suppressed than acetoclastic. Elevated O2 shifted the greenhouse gas emissions from CH4 to CO2. The metabolic effects of combined SO42- and O2 exposures on CH4 and CO2 emissions were similar to those of O2 exposure alone. The reduction in CH4 emission by increased SO42- and O2 was much greater than the concomitant increase in CO2 emission. Thus, greater SO42- and O2 exposure in wetlands is expected to reduce the aggregate warming effect of CH4 and CO2. Metaproteomics and stoichiometric modeling revealed a unique subnetwork involving carbon metabolism that converts lactate and SO42- to produce acetate, H2S, and CO2 when SO42- is elevated under oxic conditions. This study provides greater quantitative resolution of key metabolic processes necessary for the prediction of CH4 and CO2 emissions from wetlands under future climate scenarios.

TI  - Metagenomic insights into phosphorus cycling after alpine grassland restoration
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsSoil microbial phosphorus (P) cycling plays a pivotal role in ecosystem nutrient dynamics, yet its response to vegetation restoration under varying water availability, especially in alpine areas remains poorly characterized.MethodsWe integrated metagenomic sequencing with a revegetation chronosequence to systematically evaluate how restoration duration and water availability shape microbial P-cycling processes in degraded meadow and desertified steppe soils.ResultsRestoration significantly increased moderately labile, stable, and total P fractions in degraded meadow soils, whereas its impact on desertified steppe soils was negligible. Notably, water availability emerged as a critical driver of both microbial community composition and the abundance of P-cycling genes. For instance, Proteobacteria dominated microbial communities in degraded meadow soils, while Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria coexisted as keystone taxa in desertified steppe soils. Furthermore, key P-cycling genes (e.g., gcd and phoD) exhibited contrasting patterns across ecosystems. The gcd gene, associated with inorganic P solubilization, was more abundant in water-limited desertified steppe soils. Structural equation modeling further clarified that in desertified steppe soils, water availability primarily regulated P transportation pathways, whereas in meadow soils, it directly influenced genes governing inorganic P solubilization and organic P mineralization.ConclusionsThese findings underscore the intricate interplay between water regimes, microbial community structure, and P-cycling functionality during restoration. Our study highlights the necessity of tailoring restoration strategies to water conditions and temporal dynamics to optimize microbial-mediated P cycling.

TI  - Microbial carbon use and associated changes in microbial community structure in high-Arctic tundra soils under elevated temperature
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - In the high-Arctic, increased temperature results in permafrost thawing and increased primary production. This fresh plant-derived material is predicted to prime microbial consortia for degradation of the organic matter stored in tundra soils. However, the effects of warming and plant input on the microbial community structure is hardly known. We assessed the use of glycine, a readily available C and N source, and cellulose, a long Cbiopolymer, by prokaryotic and fungal communities using DNA-SIP in tundra soils incubated at 8 degrees C or 16 degrees C. Glycine addition contributed mainly to instantaneous microbial carbon use and priming of soil organic matter decomposition, particularly under elevated temperature. By contrast, cellulose was linked to the dominant and active microbial communities, with potential carbon stabilization in soils. Our findings stress the importance of the type of plant-derived material in relation to microbial metabolism in high-Arctic soils and their consequences for the carbon cycle in response to global warming.

TI  - Nitrogen Addition Exacerbates the Negative Effect of Throughfall Reduction on Soil Respiration in a Bamboo Forest
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Impacts of drought events and nitrogen (N) deposition on forests are increasingly concerning in the context of global climate change, but their effects, in particular, their interactive effects on soil respiration and its components remain unclear. A two-factor random block field experiment was conducted at a subtropical Moso bamboo forest in Southwest China to explore the response of soil respiration (R-s), autotrophic respiration (R-a), and heterotrophic respiration (R-h) to throughfall re-duction and N addition. Our results showed that throughfall reduction significantly decreased R-s, which is mainly attributed to the decrease in R-a as a result of the decline in fine roots biomass. The N addition led to microbial carbon limitation hence significantly decreased R-h, and thus R-s. We also observed the negative effect of throughfall reduction on R-s was exacerbated by N addition, which is attributed to the significant reduction in R-a under the interaction between throughfall reduction N addition. Our findings suggest that R-a tended to respond more sensitively to potential drought, while R-h responds more sensitively to N deposition, and consequently, increased soil N availability caused by N deposition might aggravate the negative effect of expected drought on soil carbon cycling.

T2  - ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - PurposeThe health of rhizosphere soil microorganisms is an important indicator to evaluate soil quality. Therefore, understanding the response of rhizosphere soil microorganisms to tobacco crop succession is crucial for promoting the sustainable development of agriculture.MethodsThe microbial diversity and community structure of rhizosphere soil in continuous cropping and non-cropped tobacco for 7 years were analyzed by the Illumina platform.Result(1) Continuous cropping tobacco cause rhizosphere soil acidification and reduction in alkaline nitrogen (AN) and soil organic matter (SOM). (2) Continuous cropping tobacco reduces the diversity of rhizosphere soil microbial communities, increasing harmful functional microorganisms and declining beneficial ones. (3) The abundance of bacteria that perform nitrification and saprophytic fungi in the rhizosphere soil of continuous cropping areas decreases, inhibiting carbon and nitrogen cycling processes. (4) The composition and diversity of the soil rhizosphere microbial community are affected by the imbalance in the physicochemical property of the rhizosphere.ConclusionContinuous cropping tobacco cause rhizosphere soil acidification and nutrient imbalance, and the carbon and nitrogen cycles involved in microorganisms were damaged. Furthermore, the decreased diversity of rhizosphere soil microorganisms and the increased abundance of pathogenic fungi contribute to the continuous cropping obstacles of tobacco.

TI  - The Potential of Peatlands as Nature-Based Climate Solutions
T2  - CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review Despite covering only 3% of the land surface, peatlands represent the largest terrestrial organic carbon stock on the planet and continue to act as a carbon sink. Managing ecosystems to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and protect carbon stocks provide nature-based climate solutions that can play an important role in emission reduction strategies, particularly over the next decade. This review provides an overview of peatland management pathways that can contribute to natural climate solutions and compiles regional and global estimates for the size of potential GHG emission reductions. Recent Findings Degraded peatlands may account for 5% of current anthropogenic GHG emissions and therefore reducing emissions through rewetting and restoration offer substantial emission reductions. However, as a majority of peatland remains intact, particularly in boreal and subarctic regions, protection from future development is also an important peatland management pathway. Literature compilation indicates a global potential for peatland nature-based climate solutions of 1.1 to 2.6 Gt CO(2)e year(-1) in 2030. Peatland management can play an important role in GHG emission reductions while also providing many additional co-benefits such as biodiversity protection, reduced land subsidence, and fire-severity mitigation. Yet, climate warming will hinder the ability of peatland ecosystems to continue to act as carbon sinks indicating the importance of reducing future warming through rapid decarbonization of the economy to protect these globally significant carbon stocks.

TI  - How interactions between wildfire and seasonal soil moisture fluxes drive nitrogen cycling in Northern Sierra Nevada forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
AB  - As wildfires become larger and more severe across western North America, it grows increasingly important to understand how they will affect the biogeochemical processes influencing ecosystem recovery. Soil nitrogen (N) cycling is a key process constraining recovery rates. In addition to its direct responses to fire, N cycling can also respond to other post-fire transformations, including increases or decreases in microbial biomass, soil moisture, and pH. To examine the short-term effects of wildfire on belowground processes in the northern Sierra Nevada, we collected soil samples along a gradient from unburned to high fire severity over 10 months following a wildfire. This included immediate pre- and post-fire sampling for many variables at most sites. While season and soil moisture did not substantially alter pH, microbial biomass, net N mineralisation, and nitrification in unburned locations, they interacted with burn severity in complex ways to constrain N cycling after fire. In areas that burned, pH increased (at least initially) after fire, and there were non-monotonic changes in microbial biomass. Net N mineralisation also had variable responses to wetting in burned locations. These changes suggest burn severity and precipitation patterns can interact to alter N cycling rates following fire.

TI  - Response of archaeal communities to water regimes under simulated warming and drought conditions in Tibetan Plateau wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - Understanding how archaeal communities are affected by water-table drawdown is essential for predicting soil functional responses to future climate change and the consequences of the responses on the soil carbon cycle.
   We investigated the effect of water-table drawdown, warming, drought, and combinations thereof on archaeal communities using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and quantitative PCR.
   Methanosarcinales, Methanosaeta, Methanomicrobiales, Methanobacteriales, uncultured Rice Cluster II (RC-II), and uncultured Crenarchaeota were detected. Water-table drawdown and drought exhibited significant effects on the archaeal communities. When the water table was at or above 10 cm, the archaeal abundance at 10 cm remained high (approximately 10(9) cells per gram dry soil), whereas the archaeal abundance at 10 cm was reduced to approximately 10(8) cells per gram dry soil where the water table was lowered to 20 cm or below. When the water table kept constant, warming caused a significant reduction in the archaeal abundance, whereas drought only caused a decrease in archaeal abundance when the water table was higher than -20 cm.
   Results suggest that changes in water table may directly impact archaeal community abundance and assemblage which can in turn influence methane emissions, potentially on a large scale. Our results also indicate that archaeal communities response to water-table drawdowns that are dependent on the initial ecohydrology.

TI  - Microbial Nitrogen Cycle: Determination of Microbial Functional Activities and Related N-compounds in Environmental Samples
T2  - METAGENOMICS OF THE MICROBIAL NITROGEN CYCLE: THEORY, METHODS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is part of essential compounds such as proteins, nucleic acids, hormones, etc. Although N makes up to about 80% of the earth's atmosphere, it is not readily available for plant and animal consumption. Free-living and symbiotic microbes contain the enzyme nitrogenase which initiates the N-cycle in the biosphere by reducing dinitrogen gas to bio-available ammonia, a process called nitrogen fixation. Ammonia is subsequently oxidized to nitrate by nitrification, a two-step aerobic pathway during which ammonia is oxidized to nitrate and nitrite by the enzymes ammonia monooxygenase and nitrite oxidoreductase, respectively. Finally, nitrate is reduced to dinitrogen gas by denitrifying microorganisms, thereby closing the N cycle. Denitrification is carried out by the sequential activity of the enzymes nitrate-, nitrite, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively. Ammonia can also be incorporated into cellular biomass via the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase pathways to form amino acids and other nitrogen compounds. After cellular death, organic nitrogen compounds are released to the environment to be mineralized by microbial activities. Widely used procedures for determination of microbial functional activities of the nitrogen cycling microorganisms and of N-compounds produced during the redox reactions of the cycle will be addressed. In addition, we will consider new methodologies being developed for further understanding of the N-cycle.

TI  - The combined nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application reduced soil multifunctionality in Qinghai-Tibet plateau grasslands, China
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - The impact of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer inputs on soil nutrient cycling and ecological function processes has garnered significant attention. Soil multifunctionality primarily refers to the soil's ability to perform multiple functions simultaneously, particularly the functions related to the genes involved in carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles, which are critical for ecosystem sustainability. Despite this, the effects of N and P fertilizers on the expression of genes involved in soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles, and their consequent influence on soil multifunctionality, remain unclear. To investigate this, we conducted a long-term nine-year experiment. The experimental site was fenced to prevent grazing and included four treatments: Control (no fertilizer), N (10 g N m(-2) y(-1), urea), P (5 g P m(-2) y(-1), Ca(H2PO4)(2)), and NP (10 g N and 5 g P m(-2) y(-1), urea and Ca(H2PO4)(2)). We examined the effects of these treatments on soil microbial functional gene abundance and multifunctionality. Our findings revealed that N addition altered the composition of soil microbial functional genes but did not affect functional diversity. Both N and P inputs, as well as their combination, negatively impacted soil carbon fixation and the genes encoding enzymes for the degradation of starch, hemicellulose, cellulose, and chitin. N input also disrupted soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling by inhibiting the expression of soil denitrification genes (nirS and nosZ), phytate hydrolase gene (cphy), and a phosphatase gene (phoD). Additionally, P input significantly inhibited functional genes involved in soil nitrification, denitrification, ammonification, nitrogen fixation, and ammonia oxidation processes. It also adversely affected phytate synthesis and degradation. The combined N and P inputs had a substantial negative impact on soil nitrification (hao), denitrification (narG, nirK, nirS, and norZ), ammonification (gdh), nitrogen fixation, annamox, and nitrogen reduction, and inhibited the expression of soil phosphorus cycle genes. Long-term phosphorus application was found to have a more detrimental effect on soil multifunctionality compared to nitrogen application. Furthermore, our study showed that vegetation diversity and abundance are crucial drivers of soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling functional genes and multifunctionality. We concluded that N and P inputs alter soil multifunctionality by influencing vegetation diversity; therefore, maintaining vegetation diversity is essential for sustaining soil multifunctionality.

TI  - Microbial taxonomic and functional attributes consistently predict soil CO2 emissions across contrasting croplands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Despite distinct roles of soil microbes in regulating carbon (C) respiration in diverse environments, it remains unclear whether microbial taxonomic and functional attributes can consistently predict soil C emissions across contrasting ecosystems. Here, we conducted a large-scale sampling event across two contrasting croplands (rice and wheat-corn crop rotation) to identify specific soil microbial phylotypes and functional genes associated with soil respiration rates. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that bacterial community composition had a strong link with C respiration rates in the two contrasting cropland types; however, this link was weaker for fungal communities. More importantly, we found that the relative abundances of bacterial Solirubrobacterales_480-2, Myxococcales_mlel-27 and fungal Westerdykella had consistently negative correlation with respiration rates across paddy and upland soils. We also identified taxa that are significantly correlated to C respiration in the paddy (e.g. Methylocaldum) and upland soils (e.g. Kribbella), respectively. Further, we found multiple associations between functional genes involved in microbial C metabolism and soil respiration rates. Our findings provide novel insights into understanding microbial predictors of soil CO2 emissions in diverse croplands, which have important implications for improving C emission predictions in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Cellulose acetate-coated capacitive sensor for determining carbon-cycle enzymes activity and as a microbial Indicator for soil health
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This study demonstrates cellulose acetate (CA)-coated screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs) for soil microbial activity detection. A capacitive sensor design utilizes a coated CA layer for effective insulation in electrolytes, eliminating the need for additional signal protection. Optimization involved comparing spin and dip coating methods, with a one-layer 10-second dip coating identified as the best balance between quality and yield. These CA/SPCEs exhibited remarkable stability over a month, suggesting their potential for long-term use in monitoring agricultural soils. Analysis of CA/SPCE profile and thickness provided insights into surface characteristics and the impact of the CA coating on electrode roughness. ATR-FTIR analysis, along with capacitive sensing, demonstrated superior sensitivity and precision for monitoring CA film degradation compared to mechanical gauges. Chemical degradation studies suggest CA's potential immunity in near-neutral environments, while enzymatic degradation investigations revealed dominance by enzymes, particularly in the initial stages. The CA/ SPCE sensor responds to both enzymatic and chemical degradation, potentially serving as an indicator of total soil microbial activity. Soil experiments explored CA/SPCE with Cap-S for microbial activity sensing. Significant differences in the long-term degradation rate were observed in mycorrhizal fungi-enriched soil compared to controls, highlighting microbial influences. This study underscores the adaptability and versatility of this technology, particularly for assessing C-cycle microbial activity in agricultural fields.

TI  - Global soil metagenomics reveals distribution and predominance of Deltaproteobacteria in nitrogen-fixing microbiome
T2  - MICROBIOME
AB  - Background Biological nitrogen fixation is a fundamental process sustaining all life on earth. While distribution and diversity of N2-fixing soil microbes have been investigated by numerous PCR amplicon sequencing of nitrogenase genes, their comprehensive understanding has been hindered by lack of de facto standard protocols for amplicon surveys and possible PCR biases. Here, by fully leveraging the planetary collections of soil shotgun metagenomes along with recently expanded culture collections, we evaluated the global distribution and diversity of terrestrial diazotrophic microbiome. Results After the extensive analysis of 1,451 soil metagenomic samples, we revealed that the Anaeromyxobacteraceae and Geobacteraceae within Deltaproteobacteria are ubiquitous groups of diazotrophic microbiome in the soils with different geographic origins and land usage types, with particular predominance in anaerobic soils (paddy soils and sediments). Conclusion Our results indicate that Deltaproteobacteria is a core bacterial taxon in the potential soil nitrogen fixation population, especially in anaerobic environments, which encourages a careful consideration on deltaproteobacterial diazotrophs in understanding terrestrial nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Temporal shifts in diversity and quantity of nirS and nirK in a rice paddy field soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Denitrification is an important part of the nitrogen cycle in the environment, and diverse bacteria, archaea, and fungi are known to have denitrifying ability. Rice paddy field soils have been known to have strong denitrifying activity, but the microbes responsible for denitrification in rice paddy field soils are not well known. Present study analyzed the diversity and quantity of the nitrite reductase genes (nirS and nirK) in a rice paddy field soil. sampled four times in one rice-growing season. Clone library analyses suggested that the denitrifier community composition varied over sampling time. Although many clones were distantly related to the known NirS or NirK, some clones were related to the NirS from Burkholderiales and Rhodocyclales bacteria, and some were related to the NirK from Rhizobiales bacteria. These denitrifiers may play an important role in denitrification in the rice paddy field soil. The quantitative PCR results showed that nirK was more abundant than nirS in all soil samples, but the nirK/nirS ratio decreased after water logging. These results suggest that both diversity and quantity changed over time in the rice paddy field soil, in response to the soil condition. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Role of nematodes in soil health and their use as indicators
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY
CP  - 39th Annual Meeting of the Society-of-Nematologists
AB  - The composition of nematode communities (plant-parasitic and free-living) may be used as bioindicators of soil health or condition because composition correlates well with nitrogen cycling and decomposition, two critical ecological processes in soil. Maturity and trophic diversity indices withstand statistical rigor better than do abundances, proportions, or ratios of trophic groups. Maturity indices respond to a variety of land-management practices, based largely on inferred life history characteristics of families. Similarity indices may be more useful than diversity indices because they reflect taxon composition. Improving existing indices or developing alternative indices refined by a greater understanding of the biology of key taxa may enhance the utility of nematodes as bioindicators.

TI  - Short-term responses of denitrification to chlorothalonil in riparian sediments: Process, mechanism and implication
T2  - CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB  - Pesticide residues in riparian zones have attracted much attention in recent decades. Their accumulations potentially deteriorate microbial activity and disturb nitrogen cycle in riparian sediments. In this study, the short-term effects of chlorothalonil (CTN, a common pesticide) on microbial denitrification were explored in riparian sediments at three levels (5, 10 and 25 mg kg(-1)). No significant differences were observed between control and 5 mg kg(-1) treatment; however, CTN in 10 and 25 mg kg(-1) treatments deteriorated sediment health condition and microbial activity. High concentrations of CTN also significantly decreased denitrification rates ((15) N pairing method) by 37-62%, but increased N2O emission in riparian sediments by 100-285%. Our data further revealed that CTN inhibited key enzyme activities responsible for microbial metabolism, and declined electron donor (NADH) and energy source (ATP) levels during denitrification. Key denitrifying enzyme activities were also suppressed by CTN, which explained the declined denitrification process and the elevated N2O emission. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing and quantitative-PCR analysis showed that CTN didn't remarkably change microbial community structures and denitrifying gene abundances after short-term exposure. Overall, this study highlights that riparian pesticides could impact nitrogen cycle of the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, potentially accelerating water pollution and global climate change.

TI  - Efficiency and mechanism of reducing ammonia volatilization in alkaline farmland soil using Bacillus amyloliquefaciens biofertilizer
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Ammonia volatilization from the farmland caused by the application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is the most important source of anthropogenic ammonia emissions. Biofertilizer application has been considered as an alternative option for agriculture sustainability and soil improvement. In this study, field trials were carried out to investigate the efficiency of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BA) biofertilizer on alleviating ammonia volatilization in alkaline farmland soil and increasing crop yield and nitrogen utilization. Potential response mechanisms were investigated from soil enzyme, nitrogen cycle function genes and microbial community levels. Compared with conventional fertilization, BA biofertilizer application reduced the ammonia volatilization by 68%, increased the crop yield and nitrogen recovery by 19% and 19%, respectively. Soil enzyme activity analysis showed that BA biofertilizer inhibited the urease activity and enhanced the potential ammonia oxidation (PAO). In addition, BA biofertilizer application also increased the bacterial amoA gene abundance, while decreased the ureC gene abundance. BA biofertilizer also significantly altered the community structure and composition, and especially raised the abundance of ammonia oxidation bacteria (AOB), while no changes were observed in abundance of nitrite oxidation bacteria (NOB). Briefly, BA biofertilizer was approved to reduce the transformation of fertilizer nitrogen to NH4+-N, simultaneously accelerating NH4+-N into the nitrification process, thus decreasing the NH4+-N content remained in alkaline soil and consequently alleviating the ammonia volatilization. Thus, these results suggested that the application of BA biofertilizer is a feasible strategy to improve crop yields and reduce agricultural ammonia emissions.

TI  - Macroecology Differentiation Between Bacteria and Fungi in Topsoil Across the United States
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
AB  - Bacteria and fungi possess distinct physiological traits. Their macroecology is vital for ecosystem functioning such as carbon cycling. However, bacterial and fungal biogeography and underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we investigated bacterial versus fungal macroecology by integrating a microbial-explicit model-CLM-Microbe-with measured fungal (FBC) and bacterial biomass carbon (BBC) from 34 NEON sites. The distribution of FBC, BBC, and FBC: BBC (F:B) ratio was well simulated across sites, with variations in 99% (P < 0.001), 97% (P < 0.001), and 99% (P < 0.001) being explained by the CLM-Microbe model, respectively. We found stronger biogeographic patterns of FBC relative to BBC across the United States. Fungal and bacterial turnover rates showed similar trends along latitude. However, latitudinal trends of their component fluxes (carbon assimilation, respiration, and necromass production) were distinct between bacteria and fungi, with those latitudinal trends following inverse unimodal patterns for fungi and showing exponential declining responses for bacteria. Carbon assimilation was dominated by vegetation productivity, and respiration was dominated by mean annual temperature for bacteria and fungi. The dominant factor for their necromass production differs, with edaphic factors controlling fungal and mean annual temperature controlling bacterial processes. The understanding of fungal and bacterial macroecology is an important step toward linking microbial metabolism and soil biogeochemical processes. Distinct fungal and bacterial macroecology contributes to the microbial ecology, particularly on microbial community structure and its association with ecosystem carbon cycling across space.

TI  - Seabird-affected taluses are denitrification hotspots and potential N2O emitters in the High Arctic
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - In High Arctic tundra ecosystems, seabird colonies create nitrogen cycling hotspots because of bird-derived labile organic matter. However, knowledge about the nitrogen cycle in such ornithocoprophilous tundra is limited. Here, we determined denitrification potentials and in-situ nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions of surface soils on plant-covered taluses under piscivorous seabird cliffs at two sites (BL and ST) near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, in the European High Arctic. Talus soils at both locations had very high denitrification potentials at 10 degrees C (2.62-4.88 mg N kg(-1) dry soil h(-1)), near the mean daily maximum air temperature in July in Ny-Alesund, with positive temperature responses at 20 degrees C (Q10 values, 1.6-2.3). The talus soils contained abundant denitrification genes, suggesting that they are denitrification hotspots. However, high in-situ N2O emissions, indicating the presence of both active aerobic nitrification and anaerobic denitrification, were observed only at BL (max. 16.6 mu g N m(-2) h(-1)). Rapid nitrogen turnover at BL was supported by lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, higher nitrate content, and higher delta N-15 values in the soils at BL compared with those at ST. These are attributed to the 30-fold larger seabird density at BL than at ST, providing the larger organic matter input.

TI  - Trajectory of Topsoil Nitrogen Transformations Along a Thermo-Erosion Gully on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Permafrost thaw, especially thermokarst formation, that is, ground collapse due to thawing of ice-rich permafrost, is expected to alter soil gross nitrogen (N) transformations, which can regulate plant productivity and ecosystem carbon cycle. However, it remains unclear how thermokarst formation modifies soil N processes in permafrost ecosystems. Here N-15 pool dilution techniques were used to evaluate changes in topsoil gross N transformations during various thaw stages (early, middle, and late stages) along a thermo-erosion gully on the Tibetan Plateau. Structural equation modeling was then conducted to explore the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors in affecting soil gross N transformations. The results showed that topsoil gross N mineralization (GNM) decreased at the three stages, reflecting declined inorganic N production after permafrost collapse. In contrast, topsoil gross nitrification increased only during the early stage. Additionally, the ratio of microbial N immobilization to GNM was enhanced during the middle and late stages, indicating a stronger microbial N limitation after thermokarst formation. The structural equation modeling analysis revealed that soil moisture played an important role in modulating gross N transformations. For GNM, decreased soil moisture had inhibiting effects via regulating the microbial biomass, microbial community, and enzyme activities along the thaw sequence. For gross nitrification, declined soil moisture exerted facilitating effects directly by improving oxygen availability and indirectly by modulating the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria during the early stage. Overall, these results demonstrated that thermokarst formation altered soil N processes, potentially triggering interactions between ecosystem N and carbon cycles after permafrost thaw.

TI  - Symbiotic soil fungi suppress N2O emissions but facilitate nitrogen remobilization to grains in sandy but not clay soils under organic amendments
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can form symbiotic relationships with roots of plants and potentially affect nitrogen (N) cycling in cropping systems. However, it is unclear how AMF influence N2O emissions and crop N assimilation, two key N cycling steps which are closely related to climate change and food production, under different soil management regimes. A microcosm experiment was conducted to test the effects of AMF on N2O emission and plant N assimilation, with wheat as a model crop, under organic (straw) amendment in soils with different textures. We found that AMF suppressed N2O emissions, promoted mycorrhizal N uptake and remobilization to grains and increase grain biomass under organic amendment in the sandy soil. However, AMF did not affect N2O emission, although increased plant N uptake, but inhibited mycorrhizal N remobilization to grains under organic amendment in the clay soil. These findings highlight that AMF have different effects on N2O emission and N translocation between sandy and clay soils. Appropriate soil management for mycorrhizal symbiosis in the cropping system can combat climate change and ensure food production.

TI  - Ecosystem fluxes of hydrogen in a mid-latitude forest driven by soil microorganisms and plants
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Molecular hydrogen (H-2) is an atmospheric trace gas with a large microbe-mediated soil sink, yet cycling of this compound throughout ecosystems is poorly understood. Measurements of the sources and sinks of H-2 in various ecosystems are sparse, resulting in large uncertainties in the global H-2 budget. Constraining the H-2 cycle is critical to understanding its role in atmospheric chemistry and climate. We measured H-2 fluxes at high frequency in a temperate mixed deciduous forest for 15months using a tower-based flux-gradient approach to determine both the soil-atmosphere and the net ecosystem flux of H-2. We found that Harvard Forest is a net H-2 sink (-1.4 +/- 1.1kg H(2)ha(-1)) with soils as the dominant H-2 sink (-2.0 +/- 1.0kg H(2)ha(-1)) and aboveground canopy emissions as the dominant H-2 source (+0.6 +/- 0.8kg H(2)ha(-1)). Aboveground emissions of H-2 were an unexpected and substantial component of the ecosystem H-2 flux, reducing net ecosystem uptake by 30% of that calculated from soil uptake alone. Soil uptake was highly seasonal (July maximum, February minimum), positively correlated with soil temperature and negatively correlated with environmental variables relevant to diffusion into soils (i.e., soil moisture, snow depth, snow density). Soil microbial H-2 uptake was correlated with rhizosphere respiration rates (r=0.8, P<0.001), and H-2 metabolism yielded up to 2% of the energy gleaned by microbes from carbon substrate respiration. Here, we elucidate key processes controlling the biosphere-atmosphere exchange of H-2 and raise new questions regarding the role of aboveground biomass as a source of atmospheric H-2 and mechanisms linking soil H-2 and carbon cycling. Results from this study should be incorporated into modeling efforts to predict the response of the H-2 soil sink to changes in anthropogenic H-2 emissions and shifting soil conditions with climate and land-use change.

TI  - Natural marsh-pasture/sugarcane field transitions greatly reduced lignin-derived pyrolysis products of soil organic matter
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Cultivation of marshes (Ma) to arable like pasture (Pa) and sugarcane (Sa) usually causes soil organic carbon (SOC) pool depletion within a short time. However, there are some uncertainties about which molecular composition of soil organic matter (SOM) is sensitive to land use change (LUC). In the present work, molecular components of SOM were investigated and compared to better understand the impacts of LUC on the carbon cycle from Ma to Pa or Sa in Louisiana and Florida. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/ MS) analysis indicated that LUC greatly altered the molecular composition of SOM. More lignin, polysaccharide, and phonetic compounds were founded from Ma, and more nitrogen-containing compounds were identified from Sa. Lignin and phenolic compounds had unexpectedly the most decrease from native marsh-sugarcane/pasture transitions, showing the same trend as SOC. This meant that lignin and phenol were not as stable as expected when undergoing LUC. LUC significantly yield more molecular moieties and then resulted in higher complexities and diversities of molecular components in Pa or Sa than those in Ma. Principal component analysis implied higher contributions of old carbon to SOM in Ma, and fresh biomass input contributed more SOM in Sa. Our results implied that human activities such as LUC could not only alter carbon fluxes but also simultaneously change molecular mechanisms that drive the carbon cycle.

TI  - Thermodynamics and kinetics of the isotopic equilibration of nitrogen gas (N2) in water: Implications for biological N2 fixation experiments
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
AB  - Better characterization of biological N2 fixation along with its controlling factors is needed for improved projections of the feedbacks between nitrogen cycling, ecosystems productivity, and climate dynamics. Building on an ongoing community effort to refine estimates of biological N2 fixation, we outline several considerations aimed at improving 15N2 incubation measurements. We first show based on a theoretical analysis that the bias associated with equilibrium isotopic fractionation is within the uncertainty of 15N2 incubation experiments, even under conditions with a large headspace to aqueous ratio, such as in soil or sediment incubations. Second, we empirically determine the effects of temperature and agitation on the equilibration kinetics. Shaking intensity seems to be a dominant control on the kinetics of equilibration. Our results show that nearly complete equilibration of dissolved 15N2 is achieved within 4 min of vigorous shaking at 20 degrees C at atmospheric pressure, but significantly slower at lower temperatures. The equations presented in our study are adaptable to varying 15N2 incubation conditions and other trace gas isotope addition experiments.

TI  - Diverse key nitrogen cycling genes nifH, nirS and nosZ associated with Pichavaram mangrove rhizospheres as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses
T2  - ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Mangroves are highly productive unique ecosystems harboring diverse unexplored microbial communities that play crucial roles in nutrient cycling as well as in maintaining ecosystem services. The mangrove-associated microbial communities transform the dead vegetation into nutrient sources of nitrogen, phosphorus, potash, etc. To understand the genetic and functional diversity of the bacterial communities involved in nitrogen cycling of this ecosystem, this study explored the diversity and distribution of both the nitrogen fixers and denitrifiers associated with the rhizospheres of Avicennia marina, Rhizophora mucronata, Suaeda maritima, and Salicornia brachiata of the Pichavaram mangroves. A combination of both culturable and unculturable (PCR-DGGE) approaches was adopted to explore the bacterial communities involved in nitrogen fixation by targeting the nifH genes, and the denitrifiers were explored by targeting the nirS and nosZ genes. Across the rhizospheres, Gammaproteobacteria was found to be predominant representing both nitrogen fixers and denitrifiers as revealed by culturable and unculturable analyses. Sequence analysis of soil nifH, nirS and nosZ genes clustered to unculturable, with few groups clustering with culturable groups, viz., Pseudomonas sp. and Halomonas sp. A total of 16 different culturable genera were isolated and characterized in this study. Other phyla like Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were also observed. The PCR-DGGE analysis also revealed the presence of 29 novel nifH sequences that were not reported earlier. Thus, the mangrove ecosystems serve as potential source for identifying unexplored novel microbial communities that contribute to nutrient cycling.

TI  - Long-Term Trends in Nitrogen Isotope Composition and Nitrogen Concentration in Brazilian Rainforest Trees Suggest Changes in Nitrogen Cycle
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Direct or indirect anthropogenic effects on ecosystem nitrogen cycles are important components of global change. Recent research has shown that N isotopes in tree rings reflect changes in ecosystem nitrogen sources or cycles and can be used to study past changes. We analyzed trends in two tree species from a remote and pristine tropical rainforest in Brazil, using trees of different ages to distinguish between the effect of tree age and long-term trends. Because sapwood differed from heartwood in delta(15)N and N concentration and N can be translocated between living sapwood cells, long-term trends are best seen in dead heartwood. Heartwood delta(15) N in Spanish cedar (Cedrela odorata) and big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) increased with tree age, and N concentrations increased with age in Cedrela. Controlling for tree age, delta(15) N increased significantly during the past century even when analyzing only heartwood and after removing labile N compounds. In contrast to northern temperate and boreal forests where wood delta(15)N often decreased, the delta(15)N increase in a remote rainforest is unlikely to be a direct signal of changed N deposition. More plausibly, the change in N isotopic composition indicates a more open N cycle, i.e., higher N losses relative to internal N cycling in the forest which could be the result of changed forest dynamics.

TI  - Litter inputs and phosphatase activity affect the temporal variability of organic phosphorus in a tropical forest soil in the Central Amazon
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Purpose The tropical phosphorus cycle and its relation to soil phosphorus (P) availability are a major uncertainty in projections of forest productivity. In highly weathered soils with low P concentrations, plant and microbial communities depend on abiotic and biotic processes to acquire P. We explored the seasonality and relative importance of drivers controlling the fluctuation of common P pools via processes such as litter production and decomposition, and soil phosphatase activity. Methods We analyzed intra-annual variation of tropical soil phosphorus pools using a modified Hedley sequential fractionation scheme. In addition, we measured litterfall, the mobilization of P from litter and soil extracellular phosphatase enzyme activity and tested their relation to fluctuations in P- fractions. Results Our results showed clear patterns of seasonal variability of soil P fractions during the year. We found that modeled P released during litter decomposition was positively related to change in organic P fractions, while net change in organic P fractions was negatively related to phosphatase activities in the top 5 cm. Conclusion We conclude that input of P by litter decomposition and potential soil extracellular phosphatase activity are the two main factors related to seasonal soil P fluctuations, and therefore the P economy in P impoverished soils. Organic soil P followed a clear seasonal pattern, indicating tight cycling of the nutrient, while reinforcing the importance of studying soil P as an integrated dynamic system in a tropical forest context.

TI  - Thinning intensity affects carbon sequestration and release in seasonal freeze-thaw areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - To explore how to respond to seasonal freeze-thaw cycles on forest ecosystems in the context of climate change through thinning, we assessed the potential impact of thinning intensity on carbon cycle dynamics. By varying the number of temperature cycles, the effects of various thinning intensities in four seasons. The rate of mass, litter organic carbon, and soil organic carbon (SOC) loss in response to temperature variations was examined in two degrees of decomposition. The unfrozen season had the highest decomposition rate of litter, followed by the frozen season. Semi-decomposed litter had a higher decomposition rate than undecomposed litter. The decomposition rate of litter was the highest when the thinning intensity was 10%, while the litter and SOC were low. Forest litter had a good carbon sequestration impact in the unfrozen and freeze-thaw seasons, while the converse was confirmed in the frozen and thaw seasons. The best carbon sequestration impact was identified in litter, and soil layers under a 20-25% thinning intensity, and the influence of undecomposed litter on SOC was more noticeable than that of semi-decomposed litter. Both litter and soil can store carbon: however, carbon is transported from undecomposed litter to semi-decomposed litter and to the soil over time. In summary, the best thinning intensity being 20-25%.

TI  - Trade-offs between wheat soil N2O emissions and C sequestration under straw return, elevated CO2 concentration, and elevated temperature
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The feedback between nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, straw management and future climate scenarios is not well understood, especially in wheat ecosystems. In this study, the changes in N2O emissions, soil properties, enzymes, and functional genes involved in N cycling were measured with straw return (incorporation and mulching) and straw removal, under elevated [CO2] (+200 mu mol mol(-1) above ambient [CO2]), elevated temperature (+2 degrees C above ambient temperature), and their combination. The net global warming potential (NGWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) were evaluated in combination with greenhouse gas emissions, yield, and soil organic carbon (C) sequestration. Compared with the ambient condition, elevated [CO2] and elevated temperature suppressed N2O emission by 41%-46 %. Straw return significantly increased N2O emission by 31 %-109 % through increasing soil C and N substrates and denitrifying genes abundance, compared with straw removal. In addition, the impact of straw return on N2O emission was greater than that of elevated [CO2] or temperature. Straw return generally reduced NGWP by 166.2-3353.3 kg CO2-eq ha(-1) and GHGI by 0.4-1.1 kg CO2-eq kg(-1) through increasing soil organic C sequestration by 0.1-1.1 t C ha(-1) and grain yield by 280.8 kg ha(-1)-1595.4 kg ha(-1). Straw return would stimulate N2O emissions from this wheat cropping system under future warmer, elevated [CO2] climates, but simultaneously increase grain yield and soil organic C sequestration to a greater extent. Overall, straw return is beneficial to climate change mitigation; in particular, straw incorporation would be more effective than straw mulching.

TI  - Responses of carbon cycling and soil organic carbon content to nitrogen addition in grasslands globally
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Understanding how N addition status (i.e., duration, rate, and form of N addition) impacts carbon (C) cycling has great implications for C storage prediction and grassland management. We examined 257 studies related to C cycling in grasslands and obtained a dataset of 1073 observations for meta-analysis. N addition significantly increased plant C input (plant above-ground biomass +49.1%, below-ground biomass +16.6%; litterfall biomass +17.4%; dissolved organic carbon +16.4%) across natural grasslands globally. For C loss processes, N addition enhanced litter decomposition by 9.2% and decreased soil respiration by 1.1%. In topsoil, microbial biomass C was reduced by 8.7% and soil organic C (SOC) content was increased by 3.1%. For C fluxes, N addition increased gross primary productivity and ecosystem respiration by 24.7% and 11.7% respectively, leading to negative net ecosystem exchange. These results indicated that grasslands were C sinks under N addition. Besides climate, the duration of N addition was the most important factor affecting C cycling. The response of SOC to N addition increased with time but weakened after a decade, associated with accumulative effects of N-induced soil acidification. N addition at any rate or form increased SOC content in temperate grassland/meadow while the effects in other grasslands depended on N addition status. There were higher SOC contents and the lowest net ecosystem exchange at low rates of N addition. Therefore, N addition should be limited to under 60 kg N ha-1 yr-1 to increase plant production and SOC content in grasslands globally and to maintain soil function as a C sink. More attention should be paid to the effects of the duration of N addition and soil acidification on C cycling to improve theoretical models or to help with grassland management practices and policies.

TI  - Responses of wheat nitrogen uptake and utilization, rhizosphere bacterial composition and nitrogen-cycling functional genes to nitrogen application rate, planting density and their interactions
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The nitrogen application rate and planting density affect soil physiochemical properties, plant physiological characteristics, and soil bacterial community composition. In this study, a two-factor randomized block design was adopted with two planting density levels (high density, HD and low density, LD), and three nitrogen application rate levels (no nitrogen application, N0, low nitrogen application, LN and high nitrogen application, HN). The results showed that the highest yield was produced by LDHN and HDLN, while HDLN had the highest nitrogen use efficiency. Root dry weight was highest in HDHN, followed by HDLN, LDHN and LDLN, while the root nitrogen content was highest in LDHN and HDLN. In the 0-20 cm soil, LDLN had the highest pH and lowest nitrate nitrogen content, HDHN had the lowest pH, and HDLN had the highest content of soluble organic nitrogen and free amino acids. In addition, compared to LDHN, the bacterial community in HDLN and LDLN had higher alpha diversity and a higher relative abundance of functional genes involved in nitrate reduction. However, HDHN was the opposite. Additionally, correlation analysis also found that the abundance of some bacterial modules was significantly correlated with wheat nitrogen partial factor productivity. Overall, nitrogen application rates and planting density, through changing the physicochemical properties of rhizosphere soil, bacterial composition and function, and wheat root physiological properties, changed the nitrogen utilization and yield of wheat.

TI  - Thinning Intensity Enhances Soil Multifunctionality and Microbial Residue Contributions to Organic Carbon Sequestration in Chinese Fir Plantations
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Soil multifunctionality is essential for the enhancement of soil carbon sequestration, but disturbances such as thinning practices can influence soil microbial activity and carbon cycling. Microbial residues, particularly microbial residue carbon (MRC), are important contributors to soil organic carbon (SOC), but the effects of thinning intensity on MRC accumulation remain poorly understood. This study evaluated the impact of four thinning treatments-control (CK, 0%), light-intensity thinning (LIT, 20%), medium-intensity thinning (MIT, 30%), and high-intensity thinning (HIT, 45%)-on soil multifunctionality in Chinese fir plantations five years after thinning. Soil nutrient provision, microbial biomass, enzyme activity, and microbial residue carbon were assessed. The results showed that thinning intensity significantly affected soil nutrient provision and microbial biomass, with MIT and HIT showing higher nutrient levels than CK and LIT. Specifically, MIT's and HIT's total nutrient provision increased by 0.04 and 0.15 compared to that of CK. Enzyme activity was highest in LIT (+0.89), followed by MIT (+0.07), with HIT showing a decline (-0.84). Microbial biomass, including bacterial PLFAs (B-PLFAs), fungal PLFAs (F-PLFAs), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and nitrogen (MBN), was highest in CK and MIT, and lowest in HIT, with MIT showing a 0.13 increase compared to CK. Microbial residue carbon (MRC) accumulation was positively correlated with soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), available nitrogen (AN), and easily oxidized organic carbon (EOC). The highest MRC content in the 0-20 cm soil layer was observed in MIT and CK (10.46 and 11.66 g/kg, respectively), while the MRC in LIT and HIT was significantly lower, reduced by 24% and 12%, respectively. These findings highlight the significant role of thinning intensity in microbial activity and carbon cycling. Medium-intensity thinning (MIT, 30%) was identified as the most effective approach for promoting microbial biomass and enhancing carbon cycling in Chinese fir forest soils, making it an optimal approach for forest management aimed at increasing soil carbon sequestration.

TI  - Warming leads to more closed nitrogen cycling in nitrogen-rich tropical forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Warming may have profound effects on nitrogen (N) cycling by changing plant N demand and underground N supply. However, large uncertainty exists regarding how warming affects the integrated N dynamic in tropical forests. We translocated model plant-soil ecosystems from a high-altitude site (600 m) to low-altitude sites at 300 and 30 m to simulate warming by 1.0 degrees C and 2.1 degrees C, respectively, in tropical China. The effects of experimental warming on N components in plant, soil, leaching, and gas were studied over 6 years. Our results showed that foliar delta N-15 values and inorganic N (NH4-N and NO3-N) leaching were decreased under warming, with greater decreases under 2.1 degrees C of warming than under 1.0 degrees C of warming. The 2.1 degrees C of warming enhanced plant growth, plant N uptake, N resorption, and fine root biomass, suggesting higher plant N demand. Soil total N concentrations, NO3-N concentrations, microbial biomass N and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance were decreased under 2.1 degrees C of warming, which probably restricted bioavailable N supply and arbuscular mycorrhizal contribution of N supply to plants. These changes in plants, soils and leaching indicated more closed N cycling under warming, the magnitude of which varied over time. The closed N cycling became pronounced during the first 3 years of warming where the sustained reductions in soil inorganic N could not meet plant N demand. Subsequently, the closed N cycling gradually mitigated, as observed by attenuated positive responses of plant growth and less negative responses of microbial biomass N to warming during the last 3 years. Overall, the more closed N cycling under warming could facilitate ecosystem N retention and affect production in these tropical forests, but these effects would be eventually mitigated with long-term warming probably due to the restricted plant growth and microbial acclimation.

TI  - Assimilation of repeated woody biomass observations constrains decadal ecosystem carbon cycle uncertainty in aggrading forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Forest carbon sink strengths are governed by plant growth, mineralization of dead organic matter, and disturbance. Across landscapes, remote sensing can provide information about aboveground states of forests and this information can be linked to models to estimate carbon cycling in forests close to steady state. For aggrading forests this approach is more challenging and has not been demonstrated. Here we apply a Bayesian approach, linking a simple model to a range of data, to evaluate their information content, for two aggrading forests. We compare high information content analyses using local observations with retrievals using progressively sparser remotely sensed information (repeated, single, and no woody biomass observations). The net biome productivity of both forests is constrained to be a net sink with <2 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) variation across the range of inputs. However, the sequestration of particular carbon pool(s) varies with assimilated biomass information. Assimilation of repeated biomass observations reduces uncertainty and/or bias in all ecosystem C pools not just wood, compared to analyses using single or no stock information. As verification, our repeated biomass analysis explains 78-86% of variation in litter dynamics at one forest, while at the second forest total dead organic matter estimates are within observational uncertainty. The uncertainty of retrieved ecosystem traits in the repeated biomass analysis is reduced by up to 50% compared to analyses with less biomass information. This study quantifies the importance of repeated woody observations in constraining the dynamics of both wood and dead organic matter, highlighting the benefit of proposed remote sensing missions.

TI  - Mariculture Sludge Enhances Paddy Soil Quality by Regulating Bacterial Community and Enzyme Activity Through pH and Total Organic Carbon Adjustments
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Purpose Applying mariculture sludge (MS) to paddy fields has substantial implications for environmental sustainability and food security. A comprehensive analysis of the chemical properties, enzyme activity, and bacterial community structure in paddy soils under MS combination offer valuable insights for optimizing paddy field management practices. Methods MS, Acidic and alkaline rice-field soil samples were collected. Three combinations were prepared: MS with acidic paddy soil (SA), MS with alkaline paddy soil (SL), and acidic and alkaline paddy soil (AL). To investigate adaptive changes in soil properties and bacterial communities on days 32 and 64. Results Our findings revealed MS exhibited higher nutrient content and enzyme activities than paddy soil, leading to an increased concentration of available nutrients in the pore water of paddy soil and enhanced activity of carbon-acquiring enzymes. After 64 days, the MS combination improved the soil quality index by 147.54% in acidic paddy soils and by 15.28% in alkaline paddy soils. This improvement was directly influenced by the soil bacterial community and enzyme activity, with pH and total organic carbon playing indirect roles. Furthermore, MS induced a stochastic shift in bacterial dynamics within paddy soil, increasing the stability of the co-occurrence networks. Notably, MS facilitated the emergence of keystone species and biomarkers involved in carbon cycling. The FAPROTAX analysis revealed that MS promotes the breakdown of organic matter in paddy soils, supporting vital ecological and environmental functions. Conclusions These insights highlight MS effectiveness in regulating paddy soil bacterial community compositions, enhance the quality of soils, increase the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria, and optimizing carbon cycling mechanisms within paddy environments.

TI  - Large scale spatial assessment, modelling and identification of drivers of soil respiration in the Western Himalayan temperate forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Soil respiration (Rs) is a natural phenomenon of CO2 emission and has a significant contribution in regulating the carbon cycle. Identifying the drivers that influence soil CO2 emissions are essential for assessing the potential impacts of change on the Carbon (C) cycle in the forest ecosystem. The present study estimated soil respiration and evaluated different drivers i.e., soil, vegetation, climate, and topography by collecting data from twelve sites (forest sub-types) of temperate forests widely distributed in the Indian Western Himalayan Region. Total 432 observations were recorded from six individuals of two major tree species of twelve sites at three locations below the crown across the selected sites. ANOVA, Regression and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) were used to analyze the data. No significant variance in Rs between the individual trees of the selected major species and between the major species of a site were observed, however, there was a significant difference between the sites for Rs. SEM of the temperate forest explains that various climatic (maximum and minimum temperature), vegetation (density and abundance) and topographical factors (altitude, longitude and latitude) were intricately related to the functioning of the temperate forests, however Rs was positively influenced by soil temperature, maximum air temperature, and altitude, and negatively by abundance. The study concludes that Rs varied differentially across the various forest sub-types of temperate forests and increases with increase in temperature and altitude. The results would provide information for estimating the feedback of the soil carbon fluxes to future climate change and also the development of carbon management policies for forest ecosystems.

TI  - Unexpected nondenitrifier nitrous oxide reductase gene diversity and abundance in soils
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Agricultural and industrial practices more than doubled the intrinsic rate of terrestrial N fixation over the past century with drastic consequences, including increased atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas and contributor to ozone layer destruction, and its release from fixed N is almost entirely controlled by microbial activities. Mitigation of N2O emissions to the atmosphere has been attributed exclusively to denitrifiers possessing NosZ, the enzyme system catalyzing N2O to N-2 reduction. We demonstrate that diverse microbial taxa possess divergent nos clusters with genes that are related yet evolutionarily distinct from the typical nos genes of denitirifers. nos clusters with atypical nosZ occur in Bacteria and Archaea that denitrify (44% of genomes), do not possess other denitrification genes (56%), or perform dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium(DNRA; (31%). Experiments with the DNRA soil bacterium Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans demonstrated that the atypical NosZ is an effective N2O reductase, and PCR-based surveys suggested that atypical nosZ are abundant in terrestrial environments. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that atypical nos clusters possess distinctive regulatory and functional components (e. g., Sec vs. Tat secretion pathway in typical nos), and that previous nosZ-targeted PCR primers do not capture the atypical nosZ diversity. Collectively, our results suggest that nondenitrifying populations with a broad range of metabolisms and habitats are potentially significant contributors to N2O consumption. Apparently, a large, previously unrecognized group of environmental nosZ has not been accounted for, and characterizing their contributions to N2O consumption will advance understanding of the ecological controls on N2O emissions and lead to refined greenhouse gas flux models.

TI  - Forest soil carbon oxidation state and oxidative ratio responses to elevated CO2
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - The oxidative ratio (OR) of the biosphere is the stoichiometric ratio (O-2/CO2) of gas exchange by photosynthesis and respirationa key parameter in budgeting calculations of the land and ocean carbon sinks. Carbon cycle-climate feedbacks could alter the OR of the biosphere by affecting the quantity and quality of organic matter in plant biomass and soil carbon pools. This study considers the effect of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations ([CO2]) on the OR of a hardwood forest after nine growing seasons of Free-Air CO2 Enrichment. We measured changes in the carbon oxidation state (C-ox) of biomass and soil carbon pools as a proxy for the ecosystem OR. The OR of net primary production, 1.039, was not affected by elevated [CO2]. However, the C-ox of the soil carbon pool was 40% higher at elevated [CO2], and the estimated OR values for soil respiration increased from 1.006 at ambient [CO2] to 1.054 at elevated [CO2]. A biochemical inventory of the soil organic matter ascribed the increases in C-ox and OR to faster turnover of reduced substrates, lignin and lipids, at elevated [CO2]. This implicates the heterotrophic soil community response to elevated [CO2] as a driver of disequilibrium in the ecosystem OR. The oxidation of soil carbon pool constitutes an unexpected terrestrial O-2 sink. Carbon budgets constructed under the assumption of OR equilibrium would equate such a terrestrial O-2 sink to CO2 uptake by the ocean. The potential for climate-driven disequilibriua in the cycling of O-2 and CO2 warrants further investigation.

TI  - A climate-driven switch in plant nitrogen acquisition within tropical forest communities
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - The response of tropical forests to climate change will depend on individual plant species' nutritional strategies, which have not been defined in the case of the nitrogen nutrition that is critical to sustaining plant growth and photosynthesis. We used isotope natural abundances to show that a group of tropical plant species with diverse growth strategies (trees and ferns, canopy, and subcanopy) relied on a common pool of inorganic nitrogen, rather than specializing on different nitrogen pools. Moreover, the tropical species we examined changed their dominant nitrogen source abruptly, and in unison, in response to precipitation change. This threshold response indicates a coherent strategy among species to exploit the most available form of nitrogen in soils. The apparent community-wide flexibility in nitrogen uptake suggests that diverse species within tropical forests can physiologically track changes in nitrogen cycling caused by climate change.

TI  - Dynamics of the internal soil nitrogen cycles under moder and mull forest floor types on a slope in a Cryptomeria japonica D.!Don plantation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - To examine the influence of microbial carbon (C) availability on the internal soil nitrogen (N) cycles under moder and mull forest floor types within the same slope sequence, surface mineral soils (0-5 cm depth) taken at upper (moder-type forest floor) and lower (mull-type forest floor) positions on a slope in a Cryptomeria japonica D. Don plantation were incubated for 300 days. During the incubation, changes in net and gross N transformations, the organic C and N pools, and microbial respiration were monitored. Despite relatively small differences in net N mineralization in both soils, very rapid rates of gross N transformations were found in mull soil during the initial 15 days of the experiment. A rapid net nitrification occurred after days 150 and 100 in moder and mull soils, respectively, presumably because of decreased microbial C availability. However, a rapid net nitrification also occurred in the mull soil during the initial 15 days when microbial C availability was high, and gross nitrification was detected in both soils, except at day 0 in the moder soil. Changes in gross N transformations and in organic C and N pools over the experiment suggested that the start of rapid net nitrification might be influenced not only by microbial C availability, but also by the microbial availability of N relative to C.

Therefore, we examined the effects of three-year simulated field warming on the complexity of soil bacterial communities and predicted functions in a temperate steppe of Inner Mongolia. Warming significantly increased the a-diversity of bacteria in 2018 but did not affect it in 2019 and 2020. Warming increased network complexity and stability and keystone taxa, and these bacterial taxa also associated more closely with each other, indicating that the protection of interactions between bacterial taxa is very important for the conservation of biodiversity. Warming significantly increased aerobic chemoheterotrophy, ureolysis, and chemoheterotrophy, suggesting that warming increased the ability of bacteria to decompose organic matter and the emission of greenhouse gases, such as CO2 and CH4. Collectively, warming will alter soil bacterial community structure and its potential functions, further affecting key functions in grassland belowground ecosystems. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Lignicolous freshwater fungi along a north-south latitudinal gradient in the Asian/Australian region; can we predict the impact of global warming on biodiversity and function?
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Fungi play a key role in decomposition of submerged wood in streams, breaking down lignocelluloses and releasing nutrients, and are important in ecosystem functioning. These wood decay fungi are known as freshwater lignicolous fungi and are usually studied by collecting submerged woody litter, followed by incubation in a moist chamber. This review explains what are freshwater lignicolous fungi, their decay mechanisms, roles and physiological attributes. Asian/Australasian lignicolous freshwater fungi have been relatively well-surveyed and enable an account of their distribution along a latitudinal transect. Unlike freshwater leaf-dwelling fungi their diversity in water bodies is greater towards the Equator which suggests they are important for decaying submerged wood in the tropics. Riparian vegetation, disturbances such as pollution, streams drying and study methods, may all affect the diversity of freshwater lignicolous fungi, however, the overall trend is a higher diversity in the tropics and subtropics. Climate changes together with increasing deposition of woody debris from human activities, and alteration of environmental factors (such as water pollution, and dam building) will impact freshwater lignicolous fungi. Changing diversity, structure and activities of freshwater fungal communities can be expected, which will significantly impact on aquatic ecosystems, particularly on nutrient and carbon cycles. There is a great opportunity to monitor changes in freshwater fungi communities along latitudinal (north to south) and habitat gradients (from human disturbed to natural habitats), and study ecological thresholds and consequences of such changes, particularly its feedback on nutrient and carbon cycles in freshwater systems.

TI  - Using proxies of microbial community-weighted means traits to explain the cascading effect of management intensity, soil and plant traits on ecosystem resilience in mountain grasslands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Trait-based approaches provide a framework to understand the role of functional biodiversity on ecosystem functioning under global change. While plant traits have been reported as potential drivers of soil microbial community composition and resilience, studies directly assessing microbial traits are scarce, limiting our mechanistic understanding of ecosystem functioning. We used microbial biomass and enzyme stoichiometry, and mass-specific enzymes activity as proxies of microbial community-weighted mean (CWM) traits, to infer trade-offs in microbial strategies of resource use with cascading effects on ecosystem resilience. We simulated a drought event on intact plant-soil mesocosms extracted from mountain grasslands along a management intensity gradient. Ecosystem processes and properties related to nitrogen cycling were quantified before, during and after drought to characterize ecosystem resilience. Soil microbial CWM traits and ecosystem resilience to drought were strongly influenced by grassland type. Structural equation modelling revealed a cascading effect from management to ecosystem resilience through modifications in soil nutrients, and plant and microbial CWM traits. Overall, our results depict a shift from high investment in extracellular enzymes in nutrient-poor soils (oligotrophic strategy), to a copiotrophic strategy with low microbial biomass N:P and low investment in extracellular enzymes associated with exploitative plant traits in nutrient-rich soils. Microbial CWM traits responses to management intensity were highly related to ecosystem resilience. Microbial communities with a copiotrophic strategy had lower resistance but higher recovery to drought, while microbial communities with an oligotrophic strategy showed the opposite responses. The unexpected trade-off between plant and microbial resistance suggested that the lower resistance of copiotrophic microbial communities enabled plant resistance to drought. Synthesis. Grassland management has cascading effects on ecosystem resilience through its combined effects on soil nutrients and plant traits propagating to microbial traits and resilience. We suggest that intensification of permanent grassland management and associated increases in soil nutrient availability decreased plant-microbe competition for N under drought through the selection of drought-sensitive microbial communities with a copiotrophic strategy that promoted plant resistance. Including proxies of microbial CWM traits into the functional trait framework will strengthen our understanding of soil ecosystem functioning under global change.

TI  - A new environment for aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria: biological soil crusts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - P>Phototrophic microorganisms are critical to the carbon cycling and productivity of biological soil crusts, which enhance water content, nutrient relations and mechanical stability of arid soils. Only oxygen-producing phototrophs, including cyanobacteria and algae, are known from soil crusts, but Earth's second major branch of photosynthetic organisms, the evolutionarily earlier anoxygenic phototrophs, is unreported. We announce the discovery of aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs in three Canadian soil crust communities. We found in a culture-based study that they comprised 0.1-5.9% of the cultivable bacterial community in moss-, lichen- and cyanobacteria-dominated crust from sand dunes and sandy soils. Comparable in density to aerobic phototrophs in other habitats, the bacteriochlorophyll a-possessing pink and orange isolates were related to species of Methylobacterium (99.0-99.5%), Belnapia (97.4-98.8%), Muricoccus (94.4%) and Sphingomonas (96.6-98.5%), based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. Our results demonstrate that proteobacterial anoxygenic phototrophs may be found in dry soil environments, implying desiccation resistance as yet unreported for this group. By utilizing sunlight for part of their energy needs, aerobic phototrophs can accelerate organic carbon cycling in nutrient-poor arid soils. Their effects will be especially important as global climate change enhances soil erosion and consequent nutrient loss.

TI  - Characteristics of denitrification genes and relevant enzyme activities in heavy-metal polluted soils remediated by biochar and compost
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Denitrification is an important process affecting nitrogen dynamics in soils. In this study, abundances of denitrification genes (narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ) and activities of nitrite reductase (S-NiR), nitrate reductase (S-NR) were measured in heavy-metal polluted soils with different amendments of biochar and compost. The relationships between physical-chemical parameters, denitrification gene abundance, and enzyme activity were analyzed by Pearson correlation method. Results showed that compost addition significantly increased the abundances of functional genes (nirS, nosZ, narG), and the abundances of nirK and nirS might be sensitive to compost and biochar addition. Compost addition and its combination with biochar significantly decreased the S-NiR enzyme activity and stimulated the S-NR enzyme activity. Negative relationships were obtained between S-NiR activity and electric conductivity (EC), water soluble carbon (WSC), nitrate, ammonium, nirK, narG gene abundances. While S-NR activity significantly positively correlated with soil EC, WSC and nirK gene abundance. Biochar and compost amendments can alter soil nitrogen cycling by changing denitrifying functional gene and relevant enzyme activities in soils polluted by heavy metals. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Interactions between earthworm burrowing, growth of a leguminous shrub and nitrogen cycling in a former agricultural soil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Attempts to restore native biodiversity into agricultural landscapes in New Zealand appear to be compromised both by soil nitrogen enrichment from farming and N-leakage to the wider environment. We investigated whether interactions between native earthworms and a native rhizobium-inoculated leguminous shrub (Sophora microphylla) have a measurable effect on the mobility of nitrogen in an agricultural soil that has been nitrogen-enriched and colonised by exotic earthworms. Plants grew better in the presence of both native and exotic soil-burrowing earthworms. Rates of root nodulation were considerably enhanced in the presence of the native megascolecid anecic earthworm Maoridrilus transalpinus. This species consumed more organic matter in the presence of inoculated plants whilst marginally lowering soil pH and enhancing critical concentrations of nitrate, but also reducing nitrous oxide emissions. Earthworms raised dehydrogenase enzyme activity and microbial activity in soil, but this was not commensurate with rates of nodulation. Our results show that some combination of earthworm-mediated soil aeration, modification of moisture conditions in the rhizosphere and drilosphere, and comminution of organic matter, modify microbial communities and significantly impact the N cycle.

TI  - Exploring the response of bacterial community functions to microplastic features in lake ecosystems through interpretable machine learning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous and have various characteristics. However, their impacts on bacterial community functions in lakes remain elusive. In this study, we identified 33 different MPs features including their abundance, shape, color, size, and polymer type, from Taihu Lake, China. These features were used to construct 48 machine learning models, utilizing four types of machine learning regression algorithms, to investigate how different MP features influence human health, carbon/nitrogen cycling, and energy source-related functions of bacterial communities. The XGBoost models provided the best performance with an average R2 of 0.85 in explaining the abundance of functions. Yellow-, fragment-, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) MPs were the most important features by Shapley values. Yellow- and PET-MPs mainly had primarily negative impacts on human pathogens pneumonia and chemoheterotrophy, respectively. Fragment-MPs had a primarily positive impact, which shifted from positive to negative at a proportion of 0.5 for methanol oxidation. Moreover, MPs may affect community structure by filtering for functional traits. These findings are important for understanding the effects of MP pollution on bacterial community function and its role in the global carbon and nitrogen cycling and human health and help us to determine the potential impacts of MP pollution on ecosystems.

TI  - Mixed Effects of Soil Compaction on the Nitrogen Cycle Under Pea and Wheat
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil compaction caused by highly mechanized agriculture can constrain soil microbial diversity and functioning. Physical pressure on the soil decreases macropores and thereby limits oxygen diffusion. The associated shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions can reduce nitrification and promote denitrification processes, leading to nitrogen (N) losses and N depletion that affect plant productivity. High soil moisture content during trafficking can exacerbate the negative effects of soil compaction. However, the extent to which soil moisture amplifies the effects of compaction on the soil microbiome and its control over N cycling is not well understood. Using a controlled greenhouse experiment with two different crops (pea and wheat), we compared the effects of compaction at three different soil moisture levels on soil physicochemical properties, microbial diversity, and the abundance of specific N species and quantification of associated microbial functional groups in the N cycle. Soil compaction increased bulk density from 15% (light compaction) to 25% (severe compaction). Compaction delayed germination in both crops and reduced yield by up to 60% for pea and 40% for wheat. Compaction further induced crop-specific shifts in microbial community structures. After compaction, the relative abundance of denitrifiers increased along with increased nitrate (NO3-) consumption and elevated nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations in the soil pores. Conversely, the relative abundance of nitrifiers remained stable under compaction, but potentially decelerated nitrification rates, resulting in ammonium (NH4+) accumulation in the soil. This study showed that soil compaction effects are proportional to the initial soil moisture content, which could serve as a good indicator of compaction severity on agricultural fields. However, the impact of soil compaction on crop performance and on microbial communities and functions associated with the N cycle were not necessarily aligned. These findings demonstrate that not only the soil physical properties but also various biological indicators need to be considered in order to provide more precise recommendations for developing sustainable farming systems.

TI  - Cascading effects of N fertilization activate biologically driven mechanisms promoting P availability in a semi-arid grassland ecosystem
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Nitrogen (N) fertilization due to N deposition, N in manure from grazing livestock and direct input to soil by humans are impacting our terrestrial ecosystems globally. However, to date, our understanding of how artificial gradients of N fertilization indirectly affect phosphorus (P) availability by altering the rates and interrelationships of multiple structural and functional attributes of terrestrial ecosystems is still limited.
   2. Here, we conducted a 3-year field experiment to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of multiple level of N addition on a wide range of ecosystem structural and functional attributes associated with >20 plant, soil and microbial variables in a semi-arid grassland.
   3. We found that N fertilization can have multiple cascading effects on ecosystem structures and functions. These cascading events ultimately result in the activation of multiple biologically driven mechanisms to promote P availability (e.g. increased soil organic P mineralization, plant phosphorus resorption, enzymatic and genetic processes of phosphatase). The increasing phosphatase production and its functional gene expression, and decreasing plant and microbial biomass might imply important shifts in the carbon-use strategies of plants and microbes allocating more resources to high-C consuming enzymatic and genetic processes and less in plant and microbial biomass. Nitrogen addition decreases fungal community biomass which suggests the decoupling of key symbiotic plant-fungal relationships for nutrient acquirement.
   4. Overall, our study advances our understanding of how and why N fertilization simultaneously influences multiple structural and functional attributes, ultimately accelerating phosphorus cycle in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Greenhouse gas fluxes from coastal wetlands at the intersection of urban pollution and saltwater intrusion: A soil core experiment
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Wetlands serve an important role in regulating greenhouse gases globally. Anthropogenic stressors including elevated nutrients and contaminants from urban pollution and elevated salinity from saltwater intrusion have the potential to alter greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in tidal wetlands that experience these stressors simultaneously. We designed a laboratory soil core experiment to disentangle the separate and combined effects of saltwater intrusion (elevated salinity versus elevated sulfate) and urban pollution (elevated nitrogen versus elevated copper) on carbon and nitrogen cycling in wetland soils. We collected 45 intact soil cores from a brackish tidal wetland and applied chemical treatments for seven weeks in the laboratory. We measured greenhouse gas soil-to-atmosphere fluxes (CO2, CH4, N2O) and porewater chemistry weekly. Soils were harvested at the end of the experiment to analyze soil chemistry and microbial carbon and nitrogen processing rates. Compared to the freshwater control, we found that elevated copper and sulfate (without elevated salinity) decreased CH4 fluxes. Treatments with elevated salinity, sulfate, or both also reduced CO2 fluxes. Likewise, carbon mineralization at the end of the experiment was lower for all treatments with elevated copper, sulfate, or salinity. In contrast, elevated salinity enhanced N2O fluxes but did not affect potential denitrification rates at the end of the experiment. Combined urban pollution and sea salt enrichment suppressed carbon gas fluxes but enhanced N2O emissions. Decreased carbon gas fluxes offset increased N2O fluxes such that the saltwater, urban, and combined treatments reduced the total global warming potential by 6.9 x, 2.6 x, and 3.6 x, respectively, relative to the freshwater control. Thus our laboratory experiment suggests in the short-term, saltwater intrusion could reduce global warming potential of coastal wetland soils in Southern New England with typical levels of urban pollution. Future research that addresses the response of coastal wetland ecosystems to combined effects of urban pollution and saltwater intrusion will be critical for predicting long-term coastal wetland function under future land use and climatic conditions.

TI  - Effect of flumetsulam alone and coexistence with polyethylene microplastics on soil microbial carbon and nitrogen cycles: Elucidation of bacterial community structure, functional gene expression, and enzyme activity
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Flumetsulam (FLU) is a new class of broad-spectrum herbicides. With the widespread use of plastic products, polyethylene (PE) microplastics (MPs) may remain in the soil. It is possible for these two novel contaminants to co-exist in the soil environment. In the present study, we used brown soil as the test soil and determined the toxicity of FLU at 0.05, 0.5 and 2.5 mg kg-1 alone and in combination with PE MPs (1%) on soil microorganisms. The obtained results demonstrated that the exposure of FLU and FLU+MPs had an inhibitory effect on the numbers of bacteria and fungi. In addition, FLU and FLU+MPs caused changes in the relevant functional bacterial genera, favored nitrogen fixation and denitrification, and promoted soil carbon fixation, but inhibited nitrification. Compared to FLU exposure alone, exposure to FLU+MPs gave rise to significant differences in soil bacterial community composition, but did not affect carbon and nitrogen cycling. The integrated biomarker response results indicated that the toxicity of FLU and FLU+MPs to soil microorganisms increased with increasing concentrations of FLU. The present experiment clarified the toxicological effects of co-exposure of FLU and MPs on microorganisms and filled the toxicological data gap of FLU.

TI  - Precipitation regime drives warming responses of microbial biomass and activity in temperate steppe soils
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB  - Although numerous warming experiments have examined the impacts of elevated temperature on soil microbial activities, most are based on responses from a single site. To investigate how precipitation regime regulates warming effects on the carbon cycle, we conducted manipulative warming experiments in desert steppe, typical steppe, and meadow steppe along a precipitation gradient in northern China. Soil temperature, moisture, microbial biomass C (MBC), N (MBN), and microbial respiration were measured from 2006 to 2009. Soil moisture was significantly reduced by warming in the typical steppe but not affected in the desert and meadow steppe. Across the 4 years, warming decreased MBC and microbial respiration in the desert and typical steppe but not in the meadow steppe. The magnitude of warming-induced reductions in MBC and microbial respiration declined as site precipitation increased. Across the three sites, the changes in soil MBC, MBN, and microbial respiration were all positively correlated with annual precipitation and changes in belowground net primary productivity. Our results suggest that precipitation regime controls the response of soil microbial activity and biomass to warming, possibly by regulating soil moisture and substrate availability. With increasing precipitation, the stimulatory effects of warming on soil microbial activity and biomass outweigh the inhibitory effects due to declining soil moisture.

TI  - Stream drying drives microbial ammonia oxidation and first-flush nitrate export
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Stream microbial communities and associated processes are influenced by environmental fluctuations that may ultimately dictate nutrient export. Discharge fluctuations caused by intermittent stream flow are increasing worldwide in response to global change. We examined the impact of flow cessation and drying on in-stream nitrogen cycling. We determined archaeal (AOA) and bacterial ammonia oxidizer (AOB) abundance and ammonia oxidation activity in surface and deep sediments from different sites along the Fuirosos stream (Spain) subjected to contrasting hydrological conditions (i.e., running water, isolated pools, and dry streambeds). AOA were more abundant than AOB, with no major changes across hydrological conditions or sediment layers. However, ammonia oxidation activity and sediment nitrate content increased with the degree of stream drying, especially in surface sediments. Upscaling of our results shows that ammonia oxidation in dry streambeds can contribute considerably (similar to 50%) to the high nitrate export typically observed in intermittent streams during first-flush events following flow reconnection. Our study illustrates how the dry channels of intermittent streams can be potential hotspots of ammonia oxidation. Consequently, shifts in the duration, spatial extent and severity of intermittent flow can play a decisive role in shaping nitrogen cycling and export along fluvial networks in response to global change.

TI  - Greenhouse gases emissions from riparian wetlands: an example from the Inner Mongolia grassland region in China
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Gradual riparian wetland drying is increasingly sensitive to global warming and contributes to climate change. Riparian wetlands play a significant role in regulating carbon and nitrogen cycles. In this study, we analyzed the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from riparian wetlands in the Xilin River basin to understand the role of these ecosystems in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Moreover, the impact of the catchment hydrology and soil property variations on GHG emissions over time and space was evaluated. Our results demonstrate that riparian wetlands emit larger amounts of CO2 (335-2790 mgm 2 h(-1) in the wet season and 72387 mgm 2 h(-1) in the dry season) than CH4 and N2O to the atmosphere due to high plant and soil respiration. The results also reveal clear seasonal variations and spatial patterns along the transects in the longitudinal direction. N2O emissions showed a spatiotemporal pattern similar to that of CO2 emissions. Near-stream sites were the only sources of CH4 emissions, while the other sites served as sinks for these emissions. Soil moisture content and soil temperature were the essential factors controlling GHG emissions, and abundant aboveground biomass promoted the CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions. Moreover, compared to different types of grasslands, riparian wetlands were the potential hotspots of GHG emissions in the Inner Mongolian region. Degradation of downstream wetlands has reduced the soil carbon pool by approximately 60 %, decreased CO2 emissions by approx- imately 35 %, and converted the wetland from a CH4 and N2O source to a sink. Our study showed that anthropogenic activities have extensively changed the hydrological characteristics of the riparian wetlands and might accelerate carbon loss, which could further affect GHG emissions.

TI  - Short-Term Response of the Soil Microbial Abundances and Enzyme Activities to Experimental Warming in a Boreal Peatland in Northeast China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Global warming is likely to influence the soil microorganisms and enzyme activity and alter the carbon and nitrogen balance of peatland ecosystems. To investigate the difference in sensitivities of carbon and nitrogen cycling microorganisms and enzyme activity to warming, we conducted three-year warming experiments in a boreal peatland. Our findings demonstrated that both mcrA and nirS gene abundance in shallow soil and deep soil exhibited insensitivity to warming, while shallow soil archaea 16S rRNA gene and amoA gene abundance in both shallow soil and deep soil increased under warming. Soil pmoA gene abundance of both layers, bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance in shallow soil, and nirK gene abundance in deep soil decreased due to warming. The decreases of these gene abundances would be a result of losing labile substrates because of the competitive interactions between aboveground plants and underground soil microorganisms. Experimental warming inhibited -glucosidase activity in two soil layers and invertase activity in deep soil, while it stimulated acid phosphatase activity in shallow soil. Both temperature and labile substrates regulate the responses of soil microbial abundances and enzyme activities to warming and affect the coupling relationships of carbon and nitrogen. This study provides a potential microbial mechanism controlling carbon and nitrogen cycling in peatland under climate warming.

TI  - Responses of soil carbon cycling microbial functional genes to nitrogen and phosphorus addition in saline-sodic soils
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsNitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) have important roles in the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle. Nevertheless, the responses of microbial ecological functions involving C cycling in saline-sodic soils to N and P are barely known, particularly at the functional gene level.MethodsThe influence of N and P addition on C functional genes in saline-sodic soils was explored using a pot experiment. Eight treatments were conducted, namely: a control (CK), three N addition levels (NL, NM, and NH), three P addition levels (PL, PM, and PH), and combined N and P addition (NP).ResultsResults revealed that the total abundance of C functional genes was enhanced by the addition of N and P, promoting C fixation, degradation, and CH4 metabolism. The total gene abundance was the highest in NL among the three N addition treatments; however, the highest abundance was observed in PH among the three P addition treatments. Compared to CK, all treatments exerted greater effects on the abundance of genes related to recalcitrant C decomposition than on labile C decomposition. This was because increment in relative abundance of oligotrophic taxa was greater than that of copiotrophic taxa after the addition of N and P. Partial least squares path modeling analysis revealed that N and P addition regulated gene abundance by altering DOC, microbial diversity, and ESP, thereby directly influencing C mineralization.ConclusionsOur results highlight that N and P stimulate the abundance of C functional genes via plant biomass and soil property traits in saline-sodic soils.

TI  - Evaluation of revised polymerase chain reaction primers for more inclusive quantification of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS
AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) fill key roles in the nitrogen cycle. Thus, well-vetted methods for characterizing their distribution are essential for framing studies of their significance in natural and managed systems. Quantification of the gene coding for one subunit of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) by polymerase chain reaction is frequently employed to enumerate the two groups. However, variable amplification of sequence variants comprising this conserved genetic marker for ammonia oxidizers potentially compromises within- and between-system comparisons. We compared the performance of newly designed non-degenerate quantitative polymerase chain reaction primer sets to existing primer sets commonly used to quantify the amoA of AOA and AOB using a collection of plasmids and soil DNA samples. The new AOA primer set provided improved quantification of model mixtures of different amoA sequence variants and increased detection of amoA in DNA recovered from soils. Although both primer sets for the AOB provided similar results for many comparisons, the new primers demonstrated increased detection in environmental application. Thus, the new primer sets should provide a useful complement to primers now commonly used to characterize the environmental distribution of AOA and AOB.

TI  - Stabilization versus decomposition in alpine ecosystems of the Northwestern Caucasus: The results of a tea bag burial experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB  - Mountainous areas exhibit highly variable decomposition rates as a result of strong local differences in climate and vegetation type. This paper describes the effect of these factors on two major determinants of the local carbon cycle: litter decomposition and carbon stabilization. In order to adequately reflect local heterogeneity, we have sampled 12 typical plant communities of the Russian Caucasus. In order to minimize confounding effects and encourage comparative studies, we have adapted the widely used tea bag index (TBI) that is typically used in areas with low decomposition. By incubating standardized tea litter for a year, we investigated whether (1) initial litter decomposition rate (k) is negatively correlated with litter stabilization (S) and (2) whether k or S exhibit correlations with altitude and other environmental conditions. Our results show that S and k are not correlated. Altitude, pH, and water content significantly influenced the stabilization factor S, while soil-freezing had no influence. In contrast, none of these factors predicted the decomposition rate k. Based on our data, we argue that collection of decomposition rates alone, as is now common practice, is not sufficient to understand carbon input to soils and can potentially lead to misleading results. Our data on community-specific decomposition and stabilization rates further constrain estimates of litter accumulation in subalpine communities and the potential effects of climate change.

TI  - Dual Controls of Shrub Encroachment in Semiarid Grasslands: Ectomycorrhizal Fungi and Soil Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Shrub encroachment significantly impacts biodiversity and ecosystem functions in grassland ecosystems. Soil microbial communities may play a key role in this process. Previous studies have focused on plant competition and soil abiotic factors, but the specific biological mechanisms by which soil microbiota drive shrub encroachment have remained poorly understood. Through integrated vegetation surveys and high-throughput sequencing of soil microbial communities across encroachment gradients in Inner Mongolia, we assessed the impacts of soil microbial composition and functional genes on the shrub importance value. We found that shrub importance value closely correlated with limited resources, including soil water and nitrogen (N), during shrub encroachment. Ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi were recruited by the semishrub Artemisia ordosica, increasing its competitiveness under conditions of resource scarcity. Changes in the microbial community affected soil N cycling by reducing the abundance of genes involved in N fixation, nitrification, and nitrate assimilation. Concurrently, shrubs preferred soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) over herbaceous plants in nutrient-poor environments. The competitiveness of shrubs was facilitated by EcM fungi, enabling them to thrive in N-deficient arid environments and preferentially utilize NO3--N. Our findings establish a novel microbial-mediated pathway driving shrub encroachment, in which EcM fungal symbionts enable host plants to alleviate nitrogen limitations through modified nutrient acquisition strategies. These results suggest that targeted manipulation of EcM associations could inform restoration strategies in shrub-encroached grasslands and highlight the need for a nitrogen management approach that accounts for microbial-mediated nutrient cycling dynamics.

TI  - Vegetation restoration limited microbial carbon sequestration in areas affected by soil erosion
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The impact of vegetation restoration on soil structure, nutrients, and microorganisms in eroded areas has been extensively studied, but the effect of vegetation restoration on carbon-sequestering bacterial communities and their associated carbon fixation capacity remains largely unknown. In this study, we focused on the 0-20 cm soil layer in eroded and vegetation restoration sites in areas of southern China that have been severely affected by soil erosion and utilized 13C stable isotope labeling and high-throughput sequencing technologies to investigate the influence of vegetation restoration on carbon-sequestering bacterial communities and their carbon sequestration potential. Compared with eroded areas, vegetation restoration areas presented greater soil nutrient contents and greater diversity of bacteria with carbon sequestration functions. Vegetation restoration also altered the composition of carbon-sequestering bacterial communities by increasing the soil alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen content, with the dominant carbon-sequestering bacteria shifting from Nocardia to Bradyrhizobium. However, the microbial carbon sequestration rate in soil erosion areas significantly increased by 2.15 times compared with that in vegetation restoration areas. Among the factors considered, pH (68.90 %, P = 0.000) was identified as the primary explanatory factor regulating changes in the microbial carbon sequestration rate. Our results are important for revealing the role of vegetation restoration in the global carbon cycle and elucidating the role of microorganisms in the soil carbon cycle.

TI  - Response of rare and abundant rhizosphere microbial communities to inoculated rhizobium in cadmium-contaminated soil phytoremediation
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
AB  - Soil microorganisms play an important role in maintaining ecosystem balance and exerting ecological functions. The taxonomic and functional changes in rare and abundant communities during in bioremediation of cadmium contaminated soils and their contributions to the remediation of ecosystem functions remain elusive despite the significance of rare and abundant microbial taxa in maintaining soil ecological function. Mesorhizobium loti HZ76-inoculated seedlings of the Robinia pseudoacacia were used to create a symbiotic system. The effects of rhizobium inoculation on rare and abundant rhizosphere microbial populations were investigated in pot experiments. Despite having minimal effects on the & alpha;-diversity of rare and abundant microbial communities, inoculation altered microbial community composition and functional gene abundance. For example, abundant phyla such as Proteobacteria were enriched following inoculation, whereas rare phyla such as Ascomycota were depleted. After inoculation, the abundance of nifH gene increased, while the abundance of amoA, amoB, nirS, nirK and nosZ gene decreased. Rare bacterial populations were more susceptible to the inoculated rhizobium's environmental alterations. In rare communities compared to abundance communities, the & alpha;-diversity was higher. Stochastic processes predominated in the communities of uncommon and abundant microorganisms. Furthermore, keystone taxa, particularly rare bacterial taxa (Gemmatimonadaceae and Saprospiraceae) and rare fungal taxa (Ascomycota), more mediates nitrogen cycle processes and is directly associated to the abundance of nitrogen functional genes. Together, our findings demonstrate the different ways that rare and abundant microbial species react to rhizobia inoculation and their connections to the nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Air injection in paddy soil reduces N2O and NH3 emissions and regulates the nitrogen cycle
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple food and a significant source of pollutant gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3). While aeration irrigation can significantly increase rice yield, its impact on N2O and NH3 emissions, particularly the nitrogen (N) cycling mechanisms, remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the effects of soil air injection (SAI) on N2O and NH3 emissions, soil properties, rice N uptake and microbial N cycling, compared with soil without air injection (the control). SAI increased soil oxygen diffusion rate (SODR) by 31-107 %, raised soil pH by 0.4-0.9 units, enhanced total N uptake by rice by 8.3 %, and reduced N2O emissions by 17 % and NH3 volatilization by 16 %. The increase in SODR enhanced the N content in rice leaves, which subsequently suppressed NH3 volatilization. The reduction in N2O emissions was mainly attributed to the decline in norC gene abundance, while the increased abundances of amoB and GDH1 genes contributed to the suppression of NH3 volatilization. The abundance of norC was negatively correlated with Actinobacteria, whereas amoB and GDH1 abundances were positively correlated with Thaumarchaeota and Proteobacteria, respectively. Actinobacteria abundance initially increased and then decreased with rising SODR, while Thaumarchaeota abundance consistently increased as SODR rose. Additionally, the increase in soil pH promoted the abundance of Proteobacteria. In conclusion, SAI increased N uptake in rice leaves and influenced key N-cycling microorganisms (Actinobacteria, Thaumarchaeota, and Proteobacteria) and genes (norC, amoB and GDH1) by enhancing SODR and soil pH, thereby reducing N2O and NH3 emissions.

TI  - Coupled sulfur and nitrogen cycling at a catchment scale: insights from isotopic and molecular techniques
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - The biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) play important roles in sustaining the Earth's ecosystem. However, their potential coupling process and underlying mechanisms in the nature remain unclear. Through joint applications of river water's isotopic compositions, isotope-pairing experiments, and molecular techniques, this study revealed the coupled N-S cycling processes at a catchment scale from both geochemical and biological perspectives. The river water's natural abundance isotopic compositions indicated that sulfide oxidation was an important source (67.0 +/- 5.5 % in summer and 72.0 +/- 5.5 % in winter) of riverine sulfate (SO42-). In addition, sulfide oxidation and NOx reduction (especially denitrification) were tightly coupled in summer but less significantly so in winter. However, the coupling of sulfide oxidation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) could not be overlooked in winter. The N-15 pairing experiments quantitatively showed that the high sulfide oxidation rates in summer (4.7 +/- 2.3 mol/km(2)/h) were significantly associated with the denitrification. Metagenomics and qPCR analyses of the soils supported the isotopic interpretations, substantiating the metabolic potential and coexistence of bacterial denitrification, DNRA, and sulfide oxidation, which was more prevalent in summer. This study reveals comprehensive evidence that sulfide oxidation and NOx reduction are tightly coupled at the catchment scale, which provides a new perspective towards a better understanding of N-S cycling.

TI  - Clomazone influence soil microbial community and soil nitrogen cycling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - We designed an indoor mesocosm experiment to investigate the long-term effects of exposure to clomazone, a widely used herbicide, on soil microbial communities and their nitrogen (N) cycling functions. Clomazone was applied to two typical soils from China at three concentrations: 0.8 (the recommended dosage), 8 and 80 mg kg(-1) soil dry weight, and the mix was incubated for 90 days. Samples were removed periodically for assay with several techniques. The half-lives of clomazone in this experiment were 11-126 d. Results were significant only for the highest clomazone concentration. Next-generation sequencing of the 16S and 18S rDNA genes revealed that bacterial diversity significantly decreased whereas fungal abundance increased after day 60 but with no detectable effect on the microbial community. Hierarchical cluster and principal coordinates analysis revealed that the bacterial community structure was negatively impacted. Linear discriminant analysis of effect size identified Sphingomonas and Arthrobacter as the predominant bacterial species. Finally, we measured soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations and used real-time PCR to analyze the abundance of the N-cycling genes, nifH and amoA. In the first 30 days, the NO3--N content and the number of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria increased. N-2-fixing bacteria were inhibited after 60 days, but the NH4+-N concentration remained unchanged and was likely provided by ammoniation. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - On-farm study reveals positive relationship between gas transport capacity and organic carbon content in arable soil
T2  - SOIL
AB  - Arable soils may act as a sink in the global carbon cycle, but the prediction of their potential for carbon sequestration remains challenging. Amongst other factors, soil aeration is known to influence root growth and microbial activity and thus inputs and decomposition of soil organic carbon. However, the influence of soil aeration on soil organic carbon content has been explored only little, especially at the farm level. Here, we investigated relationships between gas transport properties and organic carbon content in the topsoil and subsoil of 30 fields of individual farms, covering a wide range of textural composition. The fields were managed either conventionally, organically, or according to no-till practice. Despite considerable overlap between the management systems, we found that tillage increased soil gas transport capability in the topsoil, while organic farming resulted in higher soil organic carbon content. Remarkably, higher gas transport capability was associated with higher soil organic carbon content, both in the topsoil and subsoil (0.53 < R-2 < 0.71). Exogenous organic carbon inputs in the form of crop residues and organic amendments, in contrast, were not related to soil organic carbon content. Based on this, we conjecture that higher gas transport capability resulted in improved conditions for root growth, which eventually led to increased input of soil organic carbon. Our findings show the importance of soil aeration for carbon storage in soil and highlight the need to consider aeration in the evaluation of carbon sequestration strategies in cropping systems.

TI  - Detection of Nitrate-Reducing/Denitrifying Bacteria from Contaminated and Uncontaminated Tallgrass Prairie Soil: Limitations of PCR Primers
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Contamination of soil by spills of crude oil and oilfield brine is known to affect the species composition and functioning of soil microbial communities. However, the effect of such contamination on nitrogen cycling, an important biogeochemical cycle in tallgrass prairie soil, is less well known. Detecting nitrate-reducing (NR) and denitrifying (DN) bacteria via PCR amplification of the genes essential for these processes depends on how well PCR primers match the sequences of these bacteria. In this study, we enriched for NR and DN bacteria from oil/brine tallgrass prairie soil contaminated 5-10 years previously versus those cultured from uncontaminated soil, confirmed the capacity of 75 strains isolated from the enrichments to reduce nitrate and/nitrite, then screened the strains with primers specific to seven nitrogen cycle functional genes. The strains comprised a phylogenetically diverse group of NR and DN bacteria, with proportionately more gamma-Proteobacteria in oil-contaminated sites and more Bacilli in brine-contaminated sites, suggesting some residual effect of the contaminants on the NR and DN species distribution. Around 82% of the strains shown to reduce nitrate/nitrite would not be identified as NR and DN bacteria by the battery of NR and DN primers used. Our results indicate an urgent need to expand the NR/DN functional gene primer database by first identifying novel NR/DN strains through their capacity to reduce nitrate/nitrite.

TI  - Soil organic matter, rather than temperature, determines the structure and functioning of subarctic decomposer communities
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The impacts of climate change on ecosystem structure and functioning are likely to be strongest at high latitudes due to the adaptation of biota to relatively low temperatures and nutrient levels. Soil warming is widely predicted to alter microbial, invertebrate, and plant communities, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning, but this has largely been demonstrated over short-term (<10 year) warming studies. Using a natural soil temperature gradient spanning 10-35 degrees C, we examine responses of soil organisms, decomposition, nitrogen cycling, and plant biomass production to long-term warming. We find that decomposer organisms are surprisingly resistant to chronic warming, with no responses of bacteria, fungi, or their grazers to temperature (fungivorous nematodes being an exception). Soil organic matter content instead drives spatial variation in microorganism abundances and mineral N availability. The few temperature effects that appear are more focused: root biomass and abundance of root-feeding nematodes decrease, and nitrification increases with increasing soil temperature. Our results suggest that transient responses of decomposers and soil functioning to warming may stabilize over time following acclimation and/or adaptation, highlighting the need for long-term, ecosystem-scale studies that incorporate evolutionary responses to soil warming.

TI  - Diversities and potential biogeochemical impacts of mangrove soil viruses
T2  - MICROBIOME
AB  - Background: Mangroves are ecologically and economically important forests of the tropics. As one of the most carbon-rich biomes, mangroves account for 11% of the total input of terrestrial carbon into oceans. Although viruses are considered to significantly influence local and global biogeochemical cycles, little information is available regarding the community structure, genetic diversity and ecological roles of viruses in mangrove ecosystems.
   Methods: Here, we utilised viral metagenomics sequencing and virome-specific bioinformatics tools to study viral communities in six mangrove soil samples collected from different mangrove habitats in Southern China.
   Results: Mangrove soil viruses were found to be largely uncharacterised. Phylogenetic analyses of the major viral groups demonstrated extensive diversity and previously unknown viral clades and suggested that global mangrove viral communities possibly comprise evolutionarily close genotypes. Comparative analysis of viral genotypes revealed that mangrove soil viromes are mainly affected by marine waters, with less influence coming from freshwaters. Notably, we identified abundant auxiliary carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes from mangrove viruses, most of which participate in biolysis of complex polysaccharides, which are abundant in mangrove soils and organism debris. Host prediction results showed that viral CAZyme genes are diverse and probably widespread in mangrove soil phages infecting diverse bacteria of different phyla.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that mangrove viruses are diverse and probably directly manipulate carbon cycling by participating in biomass recycling of complex polysaccharides, providing the knowledge essential in revealing the ecological roles of viruses in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Quantification of Key Genes Steering the Microbial Nitrogen Cycle in the Rhizosphere of Sorghum Cultivars in Tropical Agroecosystems
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The effect of agricultural management practices on geochemical cycles in moderate ecosystems is by far better understood than in semiarid regions, where fertilizer availability and climatic conditions are less favorable. We studied the impact of different fertilizer regimens in an agricultural long-term observatory in Burkina Faso at three different plant development stages ( early leaf development, flowering, and senescence) of sorghum cultivars. Using real-time PCR, we investigated functional microbial communities involved in key processes of the nitrogen cycle ( nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation, and denitrification) in the rhizosphere. The results indicate that fertilizer treatments and plant development stages combined with environmental factors affected the abundance of the targeted functional genes in the rhizosphere. While nitrogen-fixing populations dominated the investigated communities when organic fertilizers ( manure and straw) were applied, their numbers were comparatively reduced in urea-treated plots. In contrast, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) increased not only in absolute numbers but also in relation to the other bacterial groups investigated in the urea-amended plots. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea exhibited higher numbers compared to AOB independent of fertilizer application. Similarly, denitrifiers were also more abundant in the urea-treated plots. Our data imply as well that, more than in moderate regions, water availability might shape microbial communities in the rhizosphere, since low gene abundance data were obtained for all tested genes at the flowering stage, when water availability was very limited.

TI  - Effects of DOM Chemodiversity on Microbial Diversity in Forest Soils on a Continental Scale
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a critical reservoir of carbon and nutrients in forest ecosystems, playing a central role in carbon cycling and microbial community dynamics. However, the influence of DOM molecular-level diversity (chemodiversity) on microbial community diversity and spatial distribution remains poorly understood. In this study, we used Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and high-throughput sequencing to analyze soil DOM and microbial diversity along a similar to 4,000 km forest transect in China. We found that soil DOM chemodiversity varies significantly across sites, initially increasing and then decreasing with latitude. Additionally, we observed that the biogeographic distribution of DOM components has differential effects on bacterial and fungal diversity: lipid-like compounds are strongly associated with bacterial diversity, while aromatic-, carbohydrate-, and lipid-like compounds primarily influence fungal diversity. Linear models and structural equation modeling both reveal that DOM acts as a key intermediary, mediating the effects of temperature and soil properties on microbial spatial distribution. Our findings emphasize the importance of DOM molecular characteristics in shaping microbial community structure and functioning, providing new insights into how environmental factors influence microbial ecosystems and soil carbon cycles in forest ecosystems.

TI  - Unraveling the AM fungal community for understanding its ecosystem resilience to changed climate in agroecosystems
T2  - SYMBIOSIS
AB  - The changing global climate affects the agroecosystem making it challenging to achieve the world's sustainable development goals. Among the facets of belowground microbial communities, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) hold an important place. They represent the most common symbiont phylum colonizing more than 80% of the plant families and are likely to be affected by global climate change. These fungi facilitate plant's mineral acquisition, improving growth and protecting them from biotic and abiotic stresses. The elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) level, temperature, increased nitrogen and phosphorus deposition influences the plant phenology and AMF functioning through changes in diversity and community composition of AMF. The interaction effects of soil management practices due to climate change affect the system productivity and perturb mineral cycling. Understanding the carbon and nitrogen cycling of an agro-ecosystem and its associated AMF communities concerning ecosystem productivity is the need of the hour. Plant-fungal associations require a more environment resilient approach to ameliorate the effect of anthropogenic changes in carbon and nitrogen cycles. Since AMF communities alter due to local environmental conditions and land-use changes, the most adapted community may help in predicting the mycorrhizal responses to chemical fertilizers, eCO(2), temperature and drought. In this review, we aimed at investigating (i) the diversity and community composition of AMF in relation to the change in crop and soil management practices, and (ii) how the adapted AMF communities may perform in maintaining the ecosystem resilience of these agroecosystems under climate change conditions. Hence, AMF-plant symbiosis can be effectively integrated into global climate change models. Eventually, the ecosystem resilience will be better understood to exploit the resident AMF communities to offset some of the detrimental effects of anthropogenic environmental change.

TI  - Impacts of straw biochar additions on agricultural soil quality and greenhouse gas fluxes in karst area, Southwest China
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Understanding and improving environmental quality by reducing soil nutrient leaching losses, sequestering carbon (C), reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and enhancing crop productivity in highly weathered or degraded soils have always been the goals of agroecosystem researchers and producers. Biochar production and soil incorporation strategies have been recently proposed to help attain these goals. However, the effect of such approaches on soil GHG fluxes is highly uncertain and needs to be further assessed before biochar can be used on a large scale. In addition, the duration of these GHG reductions is not known and is of pivotal importance for the inclusion of biochar in climate abatement strategies. In a field trial cultivated with Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris ssp. pekinensis) and radish (Daucus carota L. var. Sativa Hoffm), rapeseed (Brassica campestris L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) straw-derived biochar was added to the soil at rates of 0, 26, 64 and 128 t ha(-1), in the whole growing season (October 2011-March 2012) to monitor the effect of treatments on soil GHG production/consumption and soil quality 16 months after biochar addition. The results showed that biochar amendment increased soil pH, nitrate nitrogen content, available phosphorus content and soil water content, but decreased soil bulk density. In biochar-treated plots, soil carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes were from 20.1 to 87.0% higher than in the control. Soil methane (CH4) uptakes were increased significantly, by 33.2 and 80.1%, between the biochar amendment at the rate of 64 and 128 t ha(-1) and the control. Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes showed no significant difference between biochar amendment and the control. Overall only the CH4 uptake-promoting effect continued into the long term, 16 months after biochar incorporation. This study demonstrates that the beneficial effects of biochar addition might first come through soil quality improvement and carbon sequestration, rather than through effects on the repression of soil C mineralization or the nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Interactions between dissolved organic matter and the microbial community are modified by microplastics and heat waves
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) exists widely in natural waters and plays an important role in river carbon cycles and greenhouse gas emissions through microbial interactions. However, information on DOM-microbe associations in response to environmental stress is limited. River environments are the main carriers of microplastic (MP) pollution, and global heat waves (HWs) are threatening river ecology. Here, through MP exposure and HW simulation experiments, we found that DOM molecular weight and aromaticity were closely related to initial microbial communities. Moreover, MP-derived DOM regulated microbial community abundance and diversity, influenced microorganism succession trajectories as deterministic factors, and competed with riverine DOM for microbial utilization. SimulatedHWs enhanced the MP-derived DOM competitive advantage and drove the microbial community to adopt a K-strategy for effective recalcitrant carbon utilization. Relative to single environmental stressor exposure, combined MP pollution and HWs led to a more unstable microbial network. This study addresses how MPs and HWs drive DOM-microbe interactions in rivers, contributes to an in-depth understanding of the fate of river DOM and microbial community succession processes, and narrows the knowledge gap in understanding carbon sinks in aquatic ecosystems influenced by human activities and climate change.

TI  - Herbicide Applications Reduce Gaseous N Losses: A Field Study of Three Consecutive Wheat-Maize Rotation Cycles in the North China Plain
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Herbicide residues in farmland soils have attracted a great deal of attention in recent decades. Their accumulation potentially decreases the activity of microbes and related enzymes, as well as disturbs the nitrogen cycle in farmland soils. In previous studies, the influence of natural factors or nitrogen fertilization on the soil nitrogen cycle have frequently been examined, but the role of herbicides has been ignored. This study was conducted to examine the effects of herbicides on NH3 volatilization- and denitrification-related nitrogen loss through three rotation cycles from 2013 to 2016. The four treatments included no urea fertilizer (CK), urea (CN), urea+acetochlor-fenoxaprop-ethyl (AC-FE), and urea+2,4D-dicamba (2,4D-DI) approaches. The results showed that the application of nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased the nitrogen losses from ammonia volatilization and denitrification in the soil. Ammonia volatilization was the main reason for the gaseous loss of urea nitrogen in a wheat-maize rotation system in the North China Plain (NCP), which was significantly higher than the denitrification loss. In the CK treatment, the cumulative nitrogen losses from ammonia volatilization and denitrification during the three crop rotation cycles were 66.64 kg N hm-2 and 8.07 kg N hm-2, respectively. Compared with CK, the nitrogen losses from ammonia volatilization and denitrification under the CN treatment increased 52.62% and 152.88%, respectively. The application of AC-FE and 2,4D-DI significantly reduced the nitrogen gas losses from the ammonia volatilization and denitrification in the soil. Ammonia volatilization reduction mainly occurred during the maize season, and the inhibition rates of AC-FE and 2,4D-DI were 7.72% and 11.80%, respectively, when compared with CN. From the perspective of the entire wheat-maize rotation cycle, the inhibition rates were 5.41% and 7.23% over three years, respectively. Denitrification reduction also mainly occurred in the maize season, with the inhibition rates of AC-FE and 2,4D-DI being 34.12% and 30.94%, respectively, when compared with CN. From the perspective of the entire wheat-maize rotation cycle, the inhibition rates were 28.39% and 28.58% over three years, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates that herbicides could impact the nitrogen cycle of farmland soil ecosystems via the suppression of ammonia volatilization and denitrification rates, thus reducing gaseous N losses and mitigating global climate change.

TI  - Straw-Enhanced Soil Bacterial Robustness via Resource-Driven Niche Dynamics in Tea Plantations, South Henan, China
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Straw application (SP) is a promising strategy for the improvement of soil fertility, but the biological effects and the mechanisms of its effects on microorganisms remain unclear. The investigation into the tea plantations (CK/S) in southern Henan, China, without/with straw amendment was carried out to assess the effects of SP on the soil bacterial communities using high-throughput sequencing. SP induced the community restructuring of the dominant phyla, e.g., Acidobacteriota, Pseudomonadota, Chloroflexota, with significantly increasing Nitrospirota, Vicinamibacterales and Anaerolineaceae (p < 0.05), while reducing Terriglobales (p < 0.05). These transitions correlated with significantly enhanced alpha-diversity and beta-diversity divergence (p < 0.05). The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) results confirmed the significant selective enrichment of nitrogen-cycling taxa (Nitrospira), copiotrophs (Chryseotalea), and anaerobic degraders (Anaerolineaceae), along with the suppression of the oligotrophic lineage (Ellin6067) by SP (p < 0.05). The co-occurrence networks of S had lower topological properties and negative cohesion (p < 0.05), which exhibited intensified simplified complexity and competition. The soil water content (WC) and pH were the main drivers of beta-diversity variation and the keystone taxa assembly, as calculated out by distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA). This study demonstrates that SP can enhance bacterial network stability and functional redundancy by resource-driven niche partitioning between copiotrophic taxa and nitrogen-cycling guilds through a competition-cooperation equilibrium.

TI  - Missing nitrogen source during ecosystem succession within retrogressive thaw slumps in Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS)-thermal erosion of soil and vegetation after ground ice thaw-are increasing. Recovery of plant biomass after RTS is important for maintaining Arctic carbon (C) stocks and is regulated by nutrient availability for new plant growth. Many RTS are characterized by verdant shrub growth mid-succession, atypical of the surrounding nutrient-limited tundra. Here, we investigated the potential for internal and external sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to support mid-successional shrub growth at three Alaskan RTS chronosequences. We assessed patterns of soil and microbial CNP, soil NP cycling rates and stocks, N inputs via biological N-2-fixation, and thaw leachate over time after disturbance. We found a clear transfer of P stocks from mineral to organic soils with increasing site age, yet insufficient N from any one source to support observed shrub growth. Instead, multiple mechanisms may have contributed to mid-successional shrub growth, including sustained N-cycling with reduced plant biomass, N leaching from undisturbed tundra, uninvestigated sources of N-2-fixation, and most promising given the large resource, deep mineral soil N stocks. These potential mechanisms of N supply are critical for the regulation of the Arctic C cycle in response to an increasingly common climate-driven disturbance.

TI  - Nitrate promotes the transfer of methane-derived carbon from the methanotroph Methylobacter sp. to the methylotroph Methylotenera sp. in eutrophic lake water
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - Eutrophic lakes are major contributors to global aquatic methane emissions. Methanotrophy, performed by methane oxidizing bacteria, results in the production of biomass, fermentation products and/or CO2, making methane-derived carbon available to non-methanotrophic organisms. Methanotrophs can co-occur with methylotrophs which are expected to consume methane-derived carbon. However, it is unknown if this interaction requires cell-to-cell contact, whether physicochemical factors affect this interaction, and what role this interaction may play in ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling in lakes. Here, we performed incubations of an enrichment culture obtained from a eutrophic lake with C-13-labeled methane, revealing the transfer of methane-derived carbon from the methanotroph Methylobacter sp. to a methylotroph of the genus Methylotenera. These microorganisms occurred both in mixed clusters and as single cells, indicating that their interaction does not require physical cell contact. In addition, the carbon transfer between the partners is dependent on the presence of nitrate, which is potentially used by Methylotenera sp. and in turn may affect the methane oxidation rate of Methylobacter sp. This interaction, and its dependence on nitrate, may have important implications for the carbon cycle in eutrophic lakes worldwide.

TI  - Generation of spatial patterns in boreal forest landscapes
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Boreal forests are composed of a few plant species with contrasting traits with respect to ecosystem functioning and spatial patterning. Early successional deciduous species, such as birch and aspen, disperse seeds widely, do not tolerate low light and nitrogen availabilities, have rapidly decaying litter, and are highly preferred by herbivores. These later succeed to conifers, such as spruce and fir, which disperse seeds locally, tolerate low light levels and low nitrogen availability, have litter that decays slowly, and are unpalatable to most mammalian herbivores. Although there are also early successional conifers, such as jack pine and Scots pine, the aspen-birch-spruce-fir successional sequence is the most common over much of North America, and (without fir) in Fennoscandia and Siberia. The course of succession in these forests is controlled partly by seed dispersal and selective foraging by mammalian herbivores. Both of these processes are spatially dynamic, but little is known about how their spatial dynamics may affect ecosystem processes, such as nitrogen cycling or productivity. We present spatially explicit models that demonstrate the following: (a) Spatially explicit seed dispersal results in more clumped distribution of tree species and persistence of greater paper birch biomass than uniform seed rain across the landscape. Such results are consistent with current spatially explicit population models of dispersal and coexistence. (b) With localized seed dispersal, the concentrations of available soil nitrogen are distributed in larger patches with sharp transitions from low to high nitrogen availability near patch edges, In contrast, with a uniform seed rain, the distribution of soil nitrogen availability was more uniform and "hotspots" were more localized. Thus, the spatial pattern of an ecosystem process (nitrogen cycling) is determined by seed dispersal and competition for light among competing populations. (c) A dispersing herbivore, such as moose, that selectively forages on early successional deciduous species with high quality litter, such as aspen or birch, and discriminates against late successional conifers, such as spruce or fir, imposes higher-order repeated patterns of plant species and biomass distribution on the landscape. Thus, seed dispersal and herbivore foraging correlate properties in adjacent patches but in different ways, and different spatial patterns emerge. Other processes, such as insect outbreaks, fire, and water flow, also may correlate properties between adjacent patches and result in additional patterns.

TI  - Threshold Dynamics in Soil Carbon Storage for Bioenergy Crops
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Because of increasing demands for bioenergy, a considerable amount of land in the midwestern United States could be devoted to the cultivation of second-generation bioenergy crops, such as switchgrass and miscanthus. The foliar carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) in these bioenergy crops at harvest is significantly higher than the ratios in replaced crops, such as corn or soybean. We show that there is a critical soil organic matter C/N ratio, where microbial biomass can be impaired as microorganisms become dependent upon net immobilization. The simulation results show that there is a threshold effect in the amount of aboveground litter input in the soil after harvest that will reach a critical organic matter C/N ratio in the soil, triggering a reduction of the soil microbial population, with significant consequences in other microbe-related processes, such as decomposition and mineralization. These thresholds are approximately 25 and 15% of aboveground biomass for switchgrass and miscanthus, respectively. These results suggest that values above these thresholds could result in a significant reduction of decomposition and mineralization, which, in turn, would enhance the sequestration of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the topsoil and reduce inorganic nitrogen losses when compared to a corn-corn-soybean rotation.

T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Soil biological activity is an integral characteristic reflecting the state of soil fertility, biodiversity, and the activity of soil processes carried out by soil organisms. In Africa, studies of soil biological properties are few compared to the agrochemical research. In this paper, we present an assessment of multiple biochemical and microbiological properties of soil from an agricultural field located in the African tropical savanna. We determined basal respiration, substrate-induced respiration, C of microbial biomass, the potential activity of denitrification, nitrogen fixation activity, and estimated prokaryotic components in the soil microbial complex by quantitative PCR. Basal respiration of soils ranged from 0.77 +/- 0.04 to 1.90 +/- 0.23 mu g C-CO2 center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1), and substrate-induced respiration ranged from 3.31 +/- 0.17 to 7.84 +/- 1.04 mu g C-CO2 center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1). The C reserves of microbial biomass averaged 403.7 +/- 121.6 mu g C center dot g(-1) of soil. The N2O emission from the upper layer on average amounted to 2.79 ng N-N2O center dot g(-1)center dot day(-1), and the potential denitrification activity reached 745 +/- 98 ng N-N2O center dot g(-1)center dot h(-1). The number of copies of bacterial genes varied from (0.19 +/- 0.02) x 10(8) to (3.52 +/- 0.8) x 10(8) copies center dot g(-1), and of archaea-from (0.10 +/- 0.01) x 10(7) to (0.29 +/- 0.01) x 10(7) copies center dot g(-1) of soil. These results were in good agreement with the studies in other seasonally wet tropical regions: the biological activity was relatively low. The difference between biological indicators of the experimental field and the reference profile were insignificant except for nitrogen loss, which was higher in the ploughed field. Biological indicators strongly varied in space; we explained their heterogeneity by non-uniform management practices in the course of agrochemical field experiments in the past. The use of organic fertilisers may cause the release of climatically active gases due to intensive microbial respiration and denitrification, but the intensity of emission would strongly depend on the cultivation and management method.

TI  - Global soil nitrogen cycle pattern and nitrogen enrichment effects: Tropical versus subtropical forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Tropical and subtropical forest biomes are a main hotspot for the global nitrogen (N) cycle. Yet, our understanding of global soil N cycle patterns and drivers and their response to N deposition in these biomes remains elusive. By a meta-analysis of 2426-single and 161-paired observations from 89 published (15) N pool dilution and tracing studies, we found that gross N mineralization (GNM), immobilization of ammonium (INH4$$ {I}_{{\mathrm{NH}}_4} $$) and nitrate (INO3$$ {I}_{{\mathrm{NO}}_3} $$), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) were significantly higher in tropical forests than in subtropical forests. Soil N cycle was conservative in tropical forests with ratios of gross nitrification (GN) to INH4$$ {I}_{{\mathrm{NH}}_4} $$ (GN/INH4$$ {I}_{{\mathrm{NH}}_4} $$) and of soil nitrate to ammonium (NO3-/NH4+) less than one, but was leaky in subtropical forests with GN/INH4$$ {I}_{{\mathrm{NH}}_4} $$ and NO3-/NH4+ higher than one. Soil NH4+ dynamics were mainly controlled by soil substrate (e.g., total N), but climatic factors (e.g., precipitation and/or temperature) were more important in controlling soil NO3- dynamics. Soil texture played a role, as GNM and INH4$$ {I}_{{\mathrm{NH}}_4} $$ were positively correlated with silt and clay contents, while INO3$$ {I}_{{\mathrm{NO}}_3} $$ and DNRA were positively correlated with sand and clay contents, respectively. The soil N cycle was more sensitive to N deposition in tropical forests than in subtropical forests. Nitrogen deposition leads to a leaky N cycle in tropical forests, as evidenced by the increase in GN/INH4$$ {I}_{{\mathrm{NH}}_4} $$, NO3-/NH4+, and nitrous oxide emissions and the decrease in INO3$$ {I}_{{\mathrm{NO}}_3} $$ and DNRA, mainly due to the decrease in soil microbial biomass and pH. Dominant tree species can also influence soil N cycle pattern, which has changed from conservative in deciduous forests to leaky in coniferous forests. We provide global evidence that tropical, but not subtropical, forests are characterized by soil N dynamics sustaining N availability and that N deposition inhibits soil N retention and stimulates N losses in these biomes.

TI  - Carbon and Nitrogen Decoupling Under an 11-Year Drought in the Shortgrass Steppe
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - The frequency and magnitude of drought is expected to increase in the US Great Plains under future climate regimes. Although semiarid systems are considered highly resistant to water limitation, novel drought events could alter linkages among biogeochemical processes, and result in new feedbacks that influence the timescale of ecosystem recovery. We examined changes in carbon and nitrogen cycling in the last 2 years of an 11-year drought manipulation in the shortgrass steppe, and under the first 2 years of recovery from drought. We measured plant production, plant tissue chemistry, soil trace gas flux, and soil inorganic nitrogen dynamics to test the extent that this magnitude of drought altered carbon and nitrogen fluxes and how these changes affected post-drought dynamics. We found that soil inorganic nitrogen was up to five times higher under severe drought than under control conditions, but that this nitrogen may not have been accessible to plants and microbial communities during drought due to diffusion limitations. Drought plots had higher N2O flux when they received equal rainfall pulses, showing that this accumulated N may be vulnerable to loss. In addition, plants in drought plots had higher tissue nitrogen for 2 years following drought. These results show that decadal-length droughts that may occur under future precipitation regimes are likely to alter ecosystem properties through interactions among precipitation, vegetation, and N cycling. Shifts in plant N, vulnerability of nitrogen to loss, and rainfall use efficiency that we observed are likely to affect the recovery time of semiarid systems subject to droughts of this magnitude.

TI  - Sequential extraction protocol for organic matter from soils and sediments using high resolution mass spectrometry
T2  - ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB  - A vast number of organic compounds are present in soil organic matter (SOM) and play an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, facilitate interactions between organisms, and represent a sink for atmospheric CO2. The diversity of different SOM compounds and their molecular characteristics is a function of the organic source material and biogeochemical history. By understanding how SOM composition changes with sources and the processes by which it is biogeochemically altered in different terrestrial ecosystems, it may be possible to predict nutrient and carbon cycling, response to system perturbations, and impact of climate change will have on SOM composition. In this study, a sequential chemical extraction procedure was developed to reveal the diversity of organic matter (OM) in different ecosystems and was compared to the previously published protocol using parallel solvent extraction (PSE). We compared six extraction methods using three sample types, peat soil, spruce forest soil and river sediment, so as to select the best method for extracting a representative fraction of organic matter from soils and sediments from a wide range of ecosystems. We estimated the extraction yield of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by total organic carbon analysis, and measured the composition of extracted OM using high resolution mass spectrometry. This study showed that OM composition depends primarily on soil and sediment characteristics. Two sequential extraction protocols, progressing from polar to non-polar solvents, were found to provide the highest number and diversity of organic compounds extracted from the soil and sediments. Water (H2O) is the first solvent used for both protocols followed by either co-extraction with methanol-chloroform (MeOH-CHCl3) mixture, or acetonitrile (ACN) and CHCl3 sequentially. The sequential extraction protocol developed in this study offers improved sensitivity, and requires less sample compared to the PSE workflow where a new sample is used for each solvent type. Furthermore, a comparison of SOM composition from the different sample types revealed that our sequential protocol allows for ecosystem comparisons based on the diversity of compounds present, which in turn could provide new insights about source and processing of organic compounds in different soil and sediment types.

TI  - Log decomposition and forest gaps synergistically shape the structure and function of wood-inhabiting microbial communities in forest ecosystems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the intricate relationships between microbes, log decomposition, and forest disturbance is vital for conserving microbial diversity and maintaining the health of forest ecosystems. However, the successional dynamics of wood-inhabiting microbial communities across different decay stages and their responses to varying forest gap positions remain poorly understood. Here, we present results from a 6-year in-situ experiment using Minjiang fir (Abies faxoniana) logs across five decay classes (I-V, representing increasing levels of decay) placed in gap centers, gap edges and under a closed canopy on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, China. Using high-throughput sequencing coupled with FUNGuild and Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) analyses, we identified a total of 6193 fungal and 10,530 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Fungal diversity in decaying logs initially increased, peaking in class III (maximum increase: 64 %), before declining in later stages. In contrast, bacterial diversity increased continuously, reaching its highest levels in decay classes IV and V (maximum increase: 27 %). Both fungal and bacterial species richness in decaying logs were greater at the center of forest gaps than under the closed canopy. Highly decayed logs favored specific fungal functional groups, such as ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi. Bacterial functional groups associated with the carbon cycle peaked in highly decayed logs (class V), whereas those linked to the nitrogen cycle were more abundant under the closed canopy. The dominant phyla, genera, and functional groups of fungi and bacteria were primarily driven by changes in log water content mediated by forest gaps, and the resulting pH and nutrient dynamics, rather than by temperature. These results highlight the pivotal roles of decaying logs and forest gaps in shaping the structural and functional succession of microbial communities. Therefore, maintaining coarse woody debris across various decomposition stages, particularly advanced decay classes, along with moderate gap disturbance, promotes the conservation of wood-inhabiting microbial diversity in forest ecosystems. Our study provides indepth insights into the positive effects of forest disturbances, which are essential for informing sustainable forest management practices and preserving ecosystem health.

TI  - Environmental factors determining distribution and activity of anammox bacteria in minerotrophic fen soils
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - In contrast to the pervasive occurrence of denitrification in soils, anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) is a spatially restricted process that depends on specific ecological conditions. To identify the factors that constrain the distribution and activity of anammox bacteria in terrestrial environments, we investigated four different soil types along a catena with opposing ecological gradients of nitrogen and water content, from an amended pasture to an ombrotrophic bog. Anammox was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) only in the nitrophilic wet meadow and the minerotrophic fen, in soil sections remaining water-saturated for most of the year and whose interstitial water contained inorganic nitrogen. Contrastingly, aerobic ammonia oxidizing microorganisms were present in all examined samples and outnumbered anammox bacteria usually by at least one order of magnitude. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a relatively high diversity of anammox bacteria with one Ca. Brocadia cluster. Three additional clusters could not be affiliated to known anammox genera, but have been previously detected in other soil systems. Soil incubations using N-15-labeled substrates revealed that anammox processes contributed about <2% to total N-2 formation, leaving nitrification and denitrification as the dominant N-removal mechanism in these soils that represent important buffer zones between agricultural land and ombrotrophic peat bogs.

TI  - Solar park promoted microbial nitrogen and phosphorus cycle potentials but reduced soil prokaryotic diversity and network stability in alpine desert ecosystem
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Solar park (SP) is rapidly growing throughout the planet due to the increasing demand for low-carbon energy, which represents a remarkable global land-use change with implications for the hosting ecosystems. Despite dozens of studies estimating the environmental impacts of SP based on local microclimate and vegetation, responses of soil microbial interactions and nutrient cycle potentials remain poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we investigated the diversity, community structure, complexity, and stability of co-occurrence network and soil enzyme activities of soil prokaryotes and fungi in habitats of ambient, the first, and sixth year since solar park establishment. Results revealed different response patterns of prokaryotes and fungi. SP led to significant differences in both prokaryotic and fungal community structures but only reduced prokaryotic alpha diversity significantly. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed a unimodal pattern of prokaryotic network features and more resistance of fungal networks to environmental variations. Microbial nitrogen and phosphorus cycle potentials were higher in SP and their variances were more explained by network features than by diversity and environmental characteristics. Our findings revealed for the first time the significant impacts of SP on soil prokaryotic and fungal stability and functional potentials, which provides a microbial insight for impact evaluation and evidence for the optimization of solar park management to maximize the delivery of ecosystem services from this growing land use.

TI  - Determining how oxygen legacy affects trajectories of soil denitrifier community dynamics and N2O emissions
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Denitrification - a key process in the global nitrogen cycle and main source of the greenhouse gas N2O - is intricately controlled by O-2. While the transition from aerobic respiration to denitrification is well-studied, our understanding of denitrifier communities' responses to cyclic oxic/anoxic shifts, prevalent in natural and engineered systems, is limited. Here, agricultural soil is exposed to repeated cycles of long or short anoxic spells (LA; SA) or constant oxic conditions (Ox). Surprisingly, denitrification and N2O reduction rates are three times greater in Ox than in LA and SA during a final anoxic incubation, despite comparable bacterial biomass and denitrification gene abundances. Metatranscriptomics indicate that LA favors canonical denitrifiers carrying nosZ clade I. Ox instead favors nosZ clade II-carrying partial- or non-denitrifiers, suggesting efficient partnering of the reduction steps among organisms. SA has the slowest denitrification progression and highest accumulation of intermediates, indicating less functional coordination. The findings demonstrate how adaptations of denitrifier communities to varying O-2 conditions are tightly linked to the duration of anoxic episodes, emphasizing the importance of knowing an environment's O-2 legacy for accurately predicting N2O emissions originating from denitrification.

TI  - Linking morpho-taxonomy to ecosystem functions: Trait-based estimation of biomass and potential carbon budget in omnivore nematodes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Omnivore nematodes within the order Dorylaimida are among the largest free-living soil-dwelling nematodes, suggesting a significant role in soil biomass and carbon cycling. However, their contribution to these soil processes remains underexplored. Estimating biomass based on nematode morphological traits provides a practical and reliable approach for assessing their contribution in carbon dynamics. This study provides estimated individual biomass and the daily carbon budget of dorylaimids, utilizing a database of taxon-specific body-size measurements sourced from publicly available literature. We calculated biomass and potential carbon budgets for 618 reported populations worldwide, encompassing 464 species, 127 genera, 47 subfamilies, and 19 families. Biomass estimates derived using body diameter as a sole predictor, based on two recently published formulae and two adjusted formulae developed in this study, were compared with Andra<acute accent>ssy's original formula, which incorporates both body length and diameter. The adjusted formulae proposed in this study demonstrated a superior fit compared to the recently published models. Overall, we found an estimated average individual omnivore nematode biomass (fresh weight) of 3.33 mu g for females and 3.55 mu g for males, and the corresponding daily carbon budgets of 0.03903 mu g and 0.04163 mu g for females and males, respectively. The considerable variability in biomass data across the taxonomic ranks, highlight the need for robust taxonomic resolution for ecological studies. This study offers a comprehensive dataset and improved formulae for estimating biomass and potential carbon budget in omnivore nematodes, enhancing our understanding of their functional roles in carbon dynamics and other ecosystem processes.

TI  - Analysis of Microbial Diversity and Greenhouse Gas Production of Decaying Pine Logs
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - In Sustainable Forest Management, decaying wood plays an important role in forest biodiversity, carbon balance and nutrient cycling. The management of this important component of forest ecosystems is limited by the fact that little is known about relationships between substrate quality and community structure of wood-inhabiting microorganisms. During decomposition, carbon stored in deadwood is lost either in the atmosphere or in the soil, but to our knowledge, limited information on the quantities of CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted is available. In the present research we investigated the correlation between the decay of logs, the decomposer microorganisms and their activities, in terms of GHG production and enzymes, in a black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold ssp. nigra) degraded forest. The decomposition of deadwood was visually assessed using a five-class system, and for each decay class four wood samples were collected. CO2, CH4 and N2O potential production from each decay class was measured in closed systems by means of gas chromatography. Enzyme activities related to carbon, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus cycling were measured fluorometrically. The composition of decomposer microbial communities (fungi, bacteria and actinobacteria) was assessed by using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting. CO2 production and enzyme activities were significantly higher in the last decay classes of deadwood. The molecular approach highlighted differences in microbial community structure both at species and abundance levels, depending on the rate of decay.

TI  - Straw biochar improves rice yield by regulating ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms and physicochemical properties of subtropical saline soils by a pot study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB  - The fertility and nitrogen cycling capacities of saline soil are limited, restricting rice yield in subtropical region of South China. The process of nitrification, facilitated by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), plays a pivotal role in nitrogen assimilation by rice and serves as a significant determinant of rice yield. This study investigated the impact of changes in the amount of straw biochar on the yield of salinity-tolerant rice, as well as the AOA and AOB responses in saline soils. The findings indicated that biochar significantly increased rice yield and the best performance (an increase of 90.87 %) was achieved in 3 % biochar amendment (BC3). The incorporation of biochar enhanced the physicochemical characteristics of soil and markedly boosted the populations of AOA and AOB. The highest AOB frequency was found in BC3 (34.4 x 10(5) copies g(-1) soil), and the AOB gene amoA was significantly correlated with rice yield factors. Nitrosospira was enriched by biochar amendment and exhibited a significant correlation (p < 0.05) with nitrogen. PLS-SEM analysis revealed that the application of biochar enhanced rice yield through its impact on soil physicochemical characteristics and by augmenting the abundance of AOA and AOB. Our results show that 3 % biochar amendment is the best condition for improving saline soil and increasing rice yield, which provides a scientific reference for the development and utilization of saline soil.

TI  - Experimental assessment of tree canopy and leaf litter controls on the microbiome and nitrogen fixation rates of two boreal mosses
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Nitrogen (N-2)-fixing moss microbial communities play key roles in nitrogen cycling of boreal forests. Forest type and leaf litter inputs regulate moss abundance, but how they control moss microbiomes and N-2-fixation remains understudied. We examined the impacts of forest type and broadleaf litter on microbial community composition and N-2-fixation rates of Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi.
   We conducted a moss transplant and leaf litter manipulation experiment at three sites with paired paper birch (Betula neoalaskana) and black spruce (Picea mariana) stands in Alaska. We characterized bacterial communities using marker gene sequencing, determined N-2-fixation rates using stable isotopes (N-15(2)) and measured environmental covariates.
   Mosses native to and transplanted into spruce stands supported generally higher N-2-fixation and distinct microbial communities compared to similar treatments in birch stands. High leaf litter inputs shifted microbial community composition for both moss species and reduced N-2-fixation rates for H. splendens, which had the highest rates. N-2-fixation was positively associated with several bacterial taxa, including cyanobacteria.
   The moss microbiome and environmental conditions controlled N-2-fixation at the stand and transplant scales. Predicted shifts from spruce- to deciduous-dominated stands will interact with the relative abundances of mosses supporting different microbiomes and N-2-fixation rates, which could affect stand-level N inputs.

TI  - Sensitive indicator microorganisms and C,N-cycle processes in soil with different petroleum hydrocarbon pollution levels
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB  - Total petroleum hydrocarbon(TPH) is toxic to soil microorganisms and humans and has become a serious public concern. This study employed chemical analysis, high-throughput sequencing, and KEGG database functional gene annotation to investigate microbial responses to TPH contamination and identify potential bioindicators for soil toxicity assessment. Our results demonstrated that TPH stress significantly altered soil microbial community stability and functional structure. In contaminated soils, the relative abundance of Actinomycetes increased by 14.03-25.06 %, while Ascomycetes and Mortieres increased by 0.85-2.2 % and 1.62-2.39 %, respectively, compared to uncontaminated soil. The Mantel test analysis identified that Nocardioides, unclassifiedMicrococcaceae, Streptomyces, and Gibberella as robust bioindicators petroleum contamination(p < 0.05). Network analysis revealed that petroleum hydrocarbons enhanced microbial community complexity, with network edges increasing by 20-90 % in contaminated soils. PICRUSt2 functional prediction showed that TPH pollution altered microbial metabolic pathways, with bacterial metabolic processes and fungal biosynthesis processes dominating (>60 %) the total pathways. The abundance of nitrification genes involved in nitrogen transformation was positively correlated with soil oil content, denitrification, and nitrogen-fixing genes showed a negative correlation with TPH content. Expressions of functional genes involved in carbon photosynthesis fixation are inhibited in oil-contaminated soil with the hydroxypropanoate-hydroxybutylate cycle (M00375) being the main carbon cycle pathway.

TI  - Effect of fires on soil organic carbon pool and mineralization in a Northeastern China wetland
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Fire occurs frequently over wetland, but little is known of its impact on soil carbon variations and carbon mineralization, process that are potentially important in global carbon cycle. To investigate this issue, we have designed and implemented a two-year field campaign to quality the effects of fire seasonality and frequency on soil carbon abundance and carbon mineralization in a wetland of the Sanjiang Plain in Northeastern China. A total of 4 burning experiments were conducted over 12 wetland plots from autumn 2007 to spring 2009. Our results show that after burning soil organic carbon (OC) increased in the burned soils during the first two growing seasons. Fire effects on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC), however, were more subtle. During the first post-burning growing season, the levels of DOC and MBC were higher than in the unburned soil. The increase however was temporary, and there was no significant difference between the burned and unburned soils in the second growing season. Carbon mineralization rate increased after burning, and CO2 emission rates were higher from burned soils than from unburned soils. Our findings suggest that burning increased CO2 emission to the atmosphere not only during the combustion process, but also through biogeochemical processes in an extended post-burning period.

TI  - Enzymology under global change: organic nitrogen turnover in alpine and sub-Arctic soils
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS
AB  - Understanding global change impacts on the globally important carbon storage in alpine, Arctic and sub-Arctic soils requires knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the balance between plant primary productivity and decomposition. Given that nitrogen availability limits both processes, understanding the response of the soil nitrogen cycle to shifts in temperature and other global change factors is crucial for predicting the fate of cold biome carbon stores. Measurements of soil enzyme activities at different positions of the nitrogen cycling network are an important tool for this purpose. We review a selection of studies that provide data on potential enzyme activities across natural, seasonal and experimental gradients in cold biomes. Responses of enzyme activities to increased nitrogen availability and temperature are diverse and seasonal dynamics are often larger than differences due to experimental treatments, suggesting that enzyme expression is regulated by a combination of interacting factors reflecting both nutrient supply and demand. The extrapolation from potential enzyme activities to prediction of elemental nitrogen fluxes under field conditions remains challenging. Progress in molecular '-omics' approaches may eventually facilitate deeper understanding of the links between soil microbial community structure and biogeochemical fluxes. In the meantime, accounting for effects of the soil spatial structure and in situ variations in pH and temperature, better mapping of the network of enzymatic processes and the identification of rate-limiting steps under different conditions should advance our ability to predict nitrogen fluxes.

TI  - Linking microbial biogeochemical cycling genes to the rhizosphere of pioneering plants in a glacier foreland
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Glacier retreat raises global concerns but brings about the moment to study soil and ecosystem development. In nutrient-limited glacier forelands, the adaptability of pioneering plant and microbial species is facilitated by their in-teractions, including rhizosphere effects, but the details of this adaptability are not yet understood. In the rhizosphere of five pioneering plants, we comprehensively deciphered the microbial taxonomic and functional compositions. Two nitrogen -fixing microbial genera, Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, were among the most abundant taxa in the rhizomicrobiome. Moreover, several rhizobial genera, including Rhizobium, Pararhizobium, Allohrizobium, and Sinorhizobium, head the list of major modules in microbial co-occurrence networks, highlighting the vital roles of nitrogen-cycling taxa in the rhizomicrobiome of pioneering plants. Microbial genes involved in nitrogen, sulfur, phos-phorus, and methane cycles were simultaneously correlated with microbial community dissimilarity, and 12 func-tional pathways were detected with distinct relative abundances among soils. Zooming in on the nitrogen-cycling genes, nifW, narC, nasA, nasB, and nirA were mainly responsible for the significant differences between soils. Further-more, soil pH and the carbon/nitrogen ratio were among the topsoil properties interacting with nitrogen and sulfur cycling gene dissimilarity. These results explicitly linked biogeochemical cycling genes to the rhizomicrobiome and soil properties, revealing the roles of these genes as microbial drivers in mediating rhizosphere soil-plant-microbiome interactions.

TI  - Contribution of micro-organisms to the carbon dynamics in black spruce (Picea mariana) forest soil in Canada
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - In order to clarify the role of micro-organisms in the carbon cycle of the boreal forest ecosystem, the vertical distribution of soil carbon, soil microbial biomass and respiratory activity was studied in a black spruce forest near Candle Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada. The total amount of carbon contained in moss and soil layers (to the depth of 50 cm beneath the mineral soil surface) was 7.2 kg m(-2), about 47% of which was in the L and FH horizons of the soil. Soil microbial biomass per dry weight of soil was largest in the L horizon, while the biomass per ground area was largest in the FH horizon. Soil respiration rate, measured using a portable infrared gas analyzer, was highest in the FH horizon, exceeding 50% of the total soil respiration. Low but significant CO2 emission was detected even in deeper soil horizon (E horizon). We also examined the respiration rate of cut roots and the effect of root excision on respiration. The contribution of root respiration to total soil respiration, calculated from root biomass and respiration rate of cut roots, was about 54%. The amount of carbon evolved through microbial respiration during the snow-free season (June-October) was estimated as 221 g C m(-2). Micro-organisms in the L horizon showed high respiratory activity as compared with those in deeper soil horizons.

TI  - Carbon constrains fungal endophyte assemblages along the timberline
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The alpha diversity of foliar fungal endophytes (FEs) in leaves of Betula ermanii in a subalpine timberline ecotone on Changbai Mountain, China increased with elevation. There were also significant differences in beta diversity along the elevation gradient. Among the environmental variables analysed, leaf carbon significantly increased with elevation, and was the most significant environmental factor that constrained the alpha and beta diversity in the FE communities. Tree height and the cellulose, lignin, and carbon/nitrogen ratio of the leaves also affected the FE assemblages. When controlled for the effects of elevation, leaf carbon was still the main driver of changes in evenness, Shannon diversity and FE community composition. The results offered clues of the carbon acquisition strategy of the foliar FEs across this cold terrain. There was strong multicollinearity between both annual precipitation and temperature, with elevation (|Pearson r|>0.986), so the effects of these climatic variables were impossible to separate; however, they may play key roles, and the direct effects of both warrant further investigation. As pioneer decomposers of leaf litter, variations in diversity and community composition of FE measured here may feedback and influence carbon cycling and dynamics in these forest ecosystems.

TI  - Temperature and Cyanobacterial Bloom Biomass Influence Phosphorous Cycling in Eutrophic Lake Sediments
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms frequently occur in freshwater lakes, subsequently, substantial amounts of decaying cyanobacterial bloom biomass (CBB) settles onto the lake sediments where anaerobic mineralization reactions prevail. Coupled Fe/S cycling processes can influence the mobilization of phosphorus (P) in sediments, with high releases often resulting in eutrophication. To better understand eutrophication in Lake Taihu (PRC), we investigated the effects of CBB and temperature on phosphorus cycling in lake sediments. Results indicated that added CBB not only enhanced sedimentary iron reduction, but also resulted in a change from net sulfur oxidation to sulfate reduction, which jointly resulted in a spike of soluble Fe(II) and the formation of FeS/FeS2. Phosphate release was also enhanced with CBB amendment along with increases in reduced sulfur. Further release of phosphate was associated with increases in incubation temperature. In addition, CBB amendment resulted in a shift in P from the Fe-adsorbed P and the relatively unreactive Residual-P pools to the more reactive Al-adsorbed P, Ca-bound P and organic-P pools. Phosphorus cycling rates increased on addition of CBB and were higher at elevated temperatures, resulting in increased phosphorus release from sediments. These findings suggest that settling of CBB into sediments will likely increase the extent of eutrophication in aquatic environments and these processes will be magnified at higher temperatures.

TI  - The distribution of particulate organic matter in the heterogeneous soil matrix - Balancing between aerobic respiration and denitrification
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Denitrification, a key process in soil nitrogen cycling, occurs predominantly within microbial hotspots, such as those around particulate organic matter (POM), where denitrifiers use nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor. For accurate prediction of dinitrogen (N2) 2 ) and nitrous oxide (N2O) 2 O) emissions from denitrification, a precise quantification of these microscale hotspots is required. The distribution of POM is of crucial importance in this context, as the local oxygen (O2) 2 ) balance is governed not only by its high O2 2 demand but also by the local O2 2 availability. Employing a unique combination of X-ray CT imaging, microscale O2 2 measurements, and 15 N labeling, we were able to quantify hotspots of aerobic respiration and denitrification. We analyzed greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, soil oxygen supply, and the distribution of POM in intact soil samples from grassland and cropland under different moisture conditions. Our findings reveal that both proximal and distal POM, identified through X-ray CT imaging, contribute to GHG emissions. The distal POM, i.e. POM at distant locations to air-filled pores, emerged as a primary driver of denitrification within structured soils of both land uses. Thus, the higher denitrification rates in the grassland could be attributed to the higher content of distal POM. Conversely, despite possessing compacted areas that could favor denitrification, the cropland had only small amounts of distal POM to stimulate denitrification in it. This underlines the complex interaction between soil structural heterogeneity, organic carbon supply, and microbial hotspot formation and thus contributes to a better understanding of soil- related GHG emissions. In summary, our study provides a holistic understanding of soil-borne greenhouse gas emissions and emphasizes the need to refine predictive models for soil denitrification and N2O 2 O emissions by incorporating the microscale distribution of POM.

TI  - Terrestrial-aquatic connectivity structures microbial communities during the formation of thermokarst lakes
T2  - ISME COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Rising air temperatures and permafrost degradation drive the erosion of palsas (permafrost mounds mainly composed of frozen peat and ice layers) and lead to the formation of thermokarst ponds and lakes, known for their high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study investigates the impact of permafrost soil erosion during thermokarst lake formation on microbial community structure and its implications for GHG dynamics in a highly degraded permafrost valley (Nunavik, northern Quebec, Canada). Samples were collected from a palsa, an emerging lake connected to the palsa, surrounding peat and soil pore water, and two mature lakes which are older, stratified, and less connected to the palsa. Analysis of total and potentially active microbial communities, based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence variants revealed significant changes in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity during thermokarst lake formation. We found distinct assembly processes depending on the stage of formation. Firstly stochastics, they became more deterministic as lakes mature. Distinct methanogens/trophs communities in emerging lake led to lower CO2:CH4 ratio compared to the surface of mature lakes. Which presented a greater diversity of methanogens and distinct methanotrophic communities, with acetogenic, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens along anaerobic an aerobic methanotrophs. Multivariate analyses revealed that selection processes were primarily driven by concentrations of CH4, CO2, and NO3-. The interplay between the nitrogen and carbon cycles appears to be pivotal in these assemblages, with nitrogen playing key roles on community structure. These findings underscore the significance of terrestrial-aquatic connectivity in shaping microbial communities and GHG emissions in thermokarst lakes.

TI  - Differences in the sensitivity of fungi and bacteria to season and invertebrates affect leaf litter decomposition in a Mediterranean stream
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Microorganisms are key drivers of leaf litter decomposition; however, the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of different microbial groups are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of seasonal variation and invertebrates on fungal and bacterial dynamics, and on leaf litter decomposition. We followed the decomposition of Populus nigra litter in a Mediterranean stream through an annual cycle, using fine and coarse mesh bags. Irrespective of the season, microbial decomposition followed two stages. Initially, bacterial contribution to total microbial biomass was higher compared to later stages, and it was related to disaccharide and lignin degradation; in a later stage, bacteria were less important and were associated with hemicellulose and cellulose degradation, while fungi were related to lignin decomposition. The relevance of microbial groups in decomposition differed among seasons: fungi were more important in spring, whereas in summer, water quality changes seemed to favour bacteria and slowed down lignin and hemicellulose degradation. Invertebrates influenced litter-associated microbial assemblages (especially bacteria), stimulated enzyme efficiencies and reduced fungal biomass. We conclude that bacterial and fungal assemblages play distinctive roles in microbial decomposition and differ in their sensitivity to environmental changes, ultimately affecting litter decomposition, which might be particularly relevant in highly seasonal ecosystems, such as intermittent streams.Structure and activity of microbial decomposers are sensitive to environmental variations, which potentially modify the carbon cycle in aquatic environments.Structure and activity of microbial decomposers are sensitive to environmental variations, which potentially modify the carbon cycle in aquatic environments.

TI  - Population characteristics and influential factors of nitrogen cycling functional genes in heavy metal contaminated soil remediated by biochar and compost
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Sixteen treatments of soil contaminated by Cu, Pb, and Zn by the addition of a different percentage of biochar and compost were incubated for 120 days. The abundance of denitrifying genes such as narG, nirK, nirS and nosZ and the ammonia-oxidizing amoA genes of ammonia-oxidizing archaea/bacteria (AOA/AOB), soil nitrite reductase activity (S-NiR) and their shaping factors were also determined. The relationships between functional genes, S-NiR, and physico-chemical parameters were analyzed using the Pearson correlation method. The study found that the changes in physico-chemical parameters, including water-soluble organic carbon (WSC), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+), were predominant in different treatments. The abundance of nirK and narG genes is most sensitive to the changes in the properties of the soil sample. Bacterial 16S rDNA gene abundance was significantly affected by NO3- and S-NiR (P < 0.05). Nitrifying genes were mainly correlated to WSC and S-NiR, while denitrifying genes were associated with pH, electrical conductivity, NO3- and S-NiR. The systematic study for the relationship between the genes and the environmental parameters will help us to deep understand the biological mechanisms of nitrogen cycle in heavy metal contaminated soils remediated by biochar and compost.

TI  - Bryophyte species differ widely in their growth and N2-fixation responses to temperature
T2  - ARCTIC SCIENCE
AB  - Bryophytes are abundant in tundra ecosystems, where they affect carbon and nitrogen cycling through primary production and associations with N-2-fixing bacteria. Bryophyte responses to climate warming are inconclusive, likely because species-specific responses are poorly understood. Here we investigated how warming affects the growth and nitrogenase activity of 10 tundra bryophyte species in two tundra landscapes. Collected bryophyte samples were grown in temperature-controlled growth chambers for 12 weeks at five temperatures from 3 to 18 degrees C. We measured growth, N concentration, delta N-15, and delta C-13 after 3 months and nitrogenase activity after 5 and 12 weeks. Bryophyte growth and associated nitrogenase activity generally increased with temperature, but species differed in their optima. Bryophyte N concentration and delta N-15 indicated that, for some species, increased N-2-fixation could not compensate for growth-induced N limitation. High landscape coverage and large positive warming effects on feather mosses and Sphagnum species highlight their competitive advantages, confirm earlier field observations, and contribute to the mechanistic understanding of differential bryophyte growth in response to warming. We suggest that indirect effects of climate change, such as surface drying and shrub expansion, are likely main threats to slow-growing bryophytes across the Arctic, with consequences for biodiversity and C balance.

TI  - Experimental warming shifts coupling of carbon and nitrogen cycles in an alpine meadow
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Aims Terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) uptake is remarkably regulated by nitrogen (N) availability in the soil. However, the coupling of C and N cycles, as reflected by C:N ratios in different components, has not been well explored in response to climate change.
   Methods Here, we applied a data assimilation approach to assimilate 14 datasets collected from a warming experiment in an alpine meadow in China into a grassland ecosystem model. We attempted to evaluate how experimental warming affects C and N coupling as indicated by constrained parameters under ambient and warming treatments separately.
   Important Findings The results showed that warming increased soil N availability with decreased C:N ratio in soil labile C pool, leading to an increase in N uptake by plants. Nonetheless, C input to leaf increased more than N, leading to an increase and a decrease in the C:N ratio in leaf and root, respectively. Litter C:N ratio was decreased due to the increased N immobilization under high soil N availability or warming-accelerated decomposition of litter mass. Warming also increased C:N ratio of slow soil organic matter pool, suggesting a greater soil C sequestration potential. As most models usually use a fixed C:N ratio across different environments, the divergent shifts of C:N ratios under climate warming detected in this study could provide a useful benchmark for model parameterization and benefit models to predict C-N coupled responses to future climate change.

TI  - Hydrodynamic and geochemical controls on soil carbon mineralization upon entry into aquatic systems
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - Erosion is the most widespread form of soil degradation and an important pathway of carbon transfer from land into aquatic systems, with significant impact on water quality and carbon cycle. However, it remains debatable whether erosion induces a carbon source or sink, and the fate of eroded soil carbon in aquatic systems remains poorly constrained. Here, we collect 41 representative soils from seven erosion-influenced basins and conduct microcosm simulation experiments to examine the fate of soil carbon under three different scenarios. We showed that soil carbon mineralization was generally promoted (by up to 10 times) in water under turbulence relative to in soils, but suppressed under static conditions upon entering into aquatic systems. Moreover, the enhancement of mineralization in turbulent systems is primarily related to soil aggregate content, while suppression in static systems positively relates to macromolecule abundance, indicating that soil geochemistry affects the magnitude of hydrodynamic effects on carbon mineralization. Random forest model further predicts that erosion may induce significant carbon sources in basins dominated by turbulent waters and aggregate-rich soils. Our findings demonstrate hydrodynamic and geochemical controls on soil carbon mineralization upon delivery into aquatic systems, which is a non-negligible part of the boundless carbon cycle and must be considered when making region-specific conservation strategies to reduce CO2 emissions from inland waters.

TI  - Subsoiling and conversion to conservation tillage enriched nitrogen cycling bacterial communities in sandy soils under long-term maize monoculture
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Desertification degrades soil health and severely reduces crop productivity. Conventional tillage practices can amplify these problems in arid and semi-arid regions. For semi-arid regions in Inner Mongolia, China, the effects of introducing different tillage practices such as subsoiling (SS), straw mulching (SM), and no-tillage (NT) on otherwise long-term conventional tilled maize monoculture systems, were examined in the context of sandy soil bacterial and archaeal community diversity. Results showed that after three to four years of introduction, subsoiling and conversion to conservation tillage practices had no immediate effect on the alpha-diversity of the soil microbial communities. The beta-diversity of the soil microbial communities was less affected by the introduced tillage practices than by the growing season conditions, soil moisture, total nitrogen, soil macro-aggregate, and organic matter. Importantly, the introduced tillage practices had a notable effect on soil microbial communities associated with nitrogen (N) cycling processes, especially N fixation, nitrate reduction, nitrification, and denitrification. In particular, several years of tillage change from long-term conventional tillage enhanced the abundance of KEGG orthologs (KOs) associated with N fixation function involving species in Rhodoplanes, Nitrospira, Skermanella, and Rhizobium according to PICURSt prediction. Rhodoplanes spp. are involved in nitrate reduction and denitrification processes, and Nitrospira spp. associated with nitrite oxidization. We conclude that, for maize monoculture systems in semi-arid sandy soils, the soil bacterial and archaeal communities associated with many beneficial N cycling processes can be significantly impacted by only three to four years of introduced conservation and subsoiling tillage practices.

TI  - Microbial indicators are better predictors of wheat yield and quality than N fertilization
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - In view of their key roles in many soil- and plant-related processes, we hypothesized that soil microorganisms could play a larger role in determining wheat baking quality than nitrogen fertilization. A field experiment was conducted under bread wheat production conditions, where different fertilization treatments, ranging from 0-120 kg/ha NH4NO3, were applied. Soil samples were taken in May, June and July. Functional genes in the nitrogen cycle were quantified and amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS region were sequenced. Wheat yields were measured, and the grain baking quality was analysed for each plot. Fertilisation did not significantly influence the yields and the grain quality. Many bacterial and fungal Amplicon Sequence Variants showed significant positive or negative correlations with yield and grain baking quality parameters. Among the functional gene quantified, the archaeal amoA showed strong negative correlations with the wheat yields and many grain and flour quality parameters. Regression models were able to explain up to 81% of the variability in grain quality based on the microbial data from the May sampling. A better understanding of the microbiology of wheat fields could lead to an optimized management of the N fertilization to maximize yields and grain quality.

TI  - Soil microbial systems respond differentially to tetracycline, sulfamonomethoxine, and ciprofloxacin entering soil under pot experimental conditions alone and in combination
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - This study investigated soil microbial responses to the application of tetracycline (TC), sulfamonomethoxine (SMM), and ciprofloxacin (CIP) alone and in combination in a soil culture pot experiment conducted at Hangzhou, China. Multiple approaches were applied for a better and complete depiction. Among the three antibiotics, SMM has a lowest dissipation and shows a most dramatic inhibition on microbial community and metabolism diversity. The combined application (AM) of SMM, CIP, and TC improved the dissipation of each antibiotic; similarly, SMM- and CIP-resistant bacteria showed larger populations in the AM than all single applications. Soils accumulated a large content of NO3-N at day 20 after multi-antibiotics perturbation. All antibiotics stimulated soil basal respirations and inhibited soil metabolism diversity, whereas the interruption exerted by SMM and AM lasted for a longer time. Six nitrogen-cycling genes including chiA, amoA, nifH, nirK, nirS, and narG were quantified and found to decrease owing to both single- and multi-antibiotics perturbation. Overall, AM was most interruptive for soils, followed by SMM perturbation, while other antibiotics could be less interruptive. These results provide systematic insights into how soil microbial systems would shift under each single- or multi-antibiotics perturbation.

TI  - Straw mulching has an enduring positive effect on soil CO2 emissions in a humid plantation
T2  - FRONTIERS OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - Mulching practices substantially affect soil CO2 emissions from agricultural ecosystems. However, the impacts of mulching practices and their enduring effects on soil CO2 fluxes in humid plantations have not been investigated. To address this research gap, a field experiment was conducted in a Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) plantation in a humid area of China to investigate the effects of various durations of straw mulching and its enduring effects on soil CO2 fluxes and soil organic carbon (SOC). Straw mulching significantly increased the soil CO2 flux by about 18 times relative to control, mainly due to the increase in soil temperature during the mulching stage. During the period of enduing effect, straw mulching still significantly increased the soil CO2 flux by 230%-270% relative to the control, primarily to the enhancement of microbial activity resulting from improved soil nutrient contents, demonstrating that straw mulching had an enduring positive impact on soil CO2 flux. Additionally, straw mulching significantly increased SOC 27%-72% during the mulching and period of enduing effect. These results indicated that straw mulching in plantations in humid regions could be potential carbon storage strategy by increasing soil carbon content.

TI  - Shifts in microbial diversity through land use intensity as drivers of carbon mineralization in soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Land use practices alter the biomass and structure Of soil microbial communities. However, the impact of land management intensity on soil microbial diversity (i.e. richness and evenness) and consequences for functioning is still poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question by coupling molecular characterization of microbial diversity with measurements of carbon (C) mineralization in soils obtained from three locations across Europe, each representing a gradient of land management intensity under different soil and environmental conditions. Bacterial and fungal diversity were characterized by high throughput sequencing of ribosomal genes. Carbon cycling activities (i.e., mineralization of autochthonous soil organic matter, mineralization of allochthonous plant residues) were measured by quantifying C-12- and C-13-CO2 release after soils had been amended, or not, with C-13-labelled wheat residues. Variation partitioning analysis was used to rank biological and physicochemical soil parameters according to their relative contribution to these activities. Across all three locations, microbial diversity was greatest at intermediate levels of land use intensity, indicating that optimal management of soil microbial diversity might not be achieved under the least intensive agriculture. Microbial richness was the best predictor of the C-cycling activities, with bacterial and fungal richness explaining 32.2 and 17% of the intensity of autochthonous soil organic matter mineralization; and fungal richness explaining 77% of the intensity of wheat residues mineralization. Altogether, our results provide evidence that there is scope for improvement in soil management to enhance microbial biodiversity and optimize C transformations mediated by microbial communities in soil.

TI  - Zokor disturbances indicated positive soil microbial responses with carbon cycle and mineral encrustation in alpine grassland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - The alpine grassland is a fragile ecosystem sensitive to human disturbance; the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau alpine grassland is an example with large areas that are currently suffering from degradation. Although subterranean mammals (e.g., the plateau zokor, Eospalax baileyi) are thought to contribute to grassland soil and plant degradation, they are native species and play positive roles in the alpine ecosystem as ecosystem engineers. However, little is known about their effect on soil microbial communities. Using Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) regions, we compared soil prokaryotic and fungal community composition and diversity in areas disturbed by plateau zokors during the grassland recovery process. We found an increase in the number of observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of soil prokaryotic and fungal microbes, while the community structure of the microbes became significantly divergent. Soil properties, plant cover, and aboveground biomass explained the majority of the changes in microbial communities, suggesting that the changes in soil and plant characteristics mainly regulate the response of soil microbes to zokor disturbance in alpine grasslands. Zokor disturbances result in positive soil microbial responses in phyla with carbon cycle and mineral encrustation associations, suggesting a positive role for soil microbial community functions. Our findings provide novel evidence that zokors are important ecosystem engineers essential for alpine ecosystem functions.

TI  - COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT AGRONOMIC ACTIVITIES ON PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES AND N-CYCLING GENE ABUNDANCES IN FARMLAND SOIL NEAR COPPER TAILINGS AREA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - To evaluate the impact of different agronomic activities on soil physicochemical properties and Ncycling gene abundances in farmland soil near copper tailings area. The pot experiments were performed from September 11 to December 5 in 2023, soil physiochemical properties, abundance of nifH, AOA-amoA, AOBamoA, nirS, nirK and nosZ, and variation of N-cycling bacterial population were investigated. Results showed that combined application of Chinese milk vetch and N fertilizer significantly decreased soil pH while increasing the levels of total nitrogen, organic matter, available nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, urease activity, alkaline proteinase activity, and abundances of nifH, AOA-amoA, and AOB-amoA. Results of multiple regression analysis suggested that the abundance of nifH, AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, nirS and nosZ negatively correlated with pH (p < 0.05), and positively correlated with available N, nitrate nitrogen and alkaline proteinase activity (p < 0.01), and the abundance of nosZ correlated positively with available nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. The main driving factors for N fixation, nitrification and denitrification, were Hyphomicrobium, Nitrospira and Nitrosospira, respectively. Combined agronomic practices had a better role in improving the cadmium-containing soil properties than the unitary Chinese milk vetch planting or N fertilizer alone. Therefore, pH, available nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen were crucial environmental factors for the abundances of nitrogen cycle genes.

TI  - Variations in belowground carbon use strategies under different climatic conditions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Belowground carbon is important to the terrestrial carbon cycle, and altitudinal gradients in mountainous areas provide natural experiment sites for analysing the carbon cycle under different climatic conditions. Therefore, to better understand belowground carbon use strategies under different climatic conditions, we quantified soil respiration (R-s) and its components (heterotrophic respiration (R-H) and autotrophic respiration (R-A)) and evaluated the belowground carbon use efficiency (CUE) at 8 sites along an altitudinal gradient (from 2017 to 3665 m asl) during the wet season (May to October) in 2015 and 2016. The results showed that the rates of R-s, R-H, and R-A and the ratios of R-H to R-s were all negatively correlated with elevation. The contribution of R-H to R-s was larger than that of R-A, ranging from to 66% to 86%. Soil temperature had a stronger relationship with R(H )than R-A, although we note that the latter was not measured directly in this study. The microbial CUE tended to decrease from the mid-elevation sites to the lower- and higher-elevation sites. The root CUE exhibited an increasing trend from the mid-elevation site to the higher-elevation sites. These results suggest that (1) when considering changes in R-s values in response to changes in soil temperature, the dominant contributor is R-H, not R-A ; (2) from the areas with moderate temperature and precipitation to the high temperature and low precipitation areas, more belowground carbon (both organic and root carbon) tend to be consumed, whereas more root carbon tend to be retained from the moderate climatic areas to the low temperature and high precipitation areas.

TI  - Magnitude and variability of process rates in fungal diversity-litter decomposition relationships
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - There is compelling evidence that losses in plant diversity can alter ecosystem functioning, particularly by reducing primary production. However, impacts of biodiversity loss on decomposition, the complementary process in the carbon cycle, are highly uncertain. By manipulating fungal decomposer diversity in stream microcosm experiments we found that rates of litter decomposition and associated fungal spore production are unaffected by changes in decomposer diversity under benign and harsher environmental conditions. This result calls for caution when generalizing outcomes of biodiversity experiments across systems. In contrast to their magnitude, the variability of process rates among communities increased when species numbers were reduced. This was most likely caused by a portfolio effect (i.e. statistical averaging), with the uneven species distribution typical of natural communities tending to weaken that effect. Curbing species extinctions to maintain ecosystem functioning thus can be important even in situations where process rates are unaffected.

TI  - Bacterial Targets as Potential Indicators of Diesel Fuel Toxicity in Subantarctic Soils
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Appropriate remediation targets or universal guidelines for polar regions do not currently exist, and a comprehensive understanding of the effects of diesel fuel on the natural microbial populations in polar and subpolar soils is lacking. Our aim was to investigate the response of the bacterial community to diesel fuel and to evaluate if these responses have the potential to be used as indicators of soil toxicity thresholds. We set up short-and long-exposure tests across a soil organic carbon gradient. Utilizing broad and targeted community indices, as well as functional genes involved in the nitrogen cycle, we investigated the bacterial community structure and its potential functioning in response to special Antarctic blend (SAB) diesel fuel. We found the primary effect of diesel fuel toxicity was a reduction in species richness, evenness, and phylogenetic diversity, with the resulting community heavily dominated by a few species, principally Pseudomonas. The decline in richness and phylogenetic diversity was linked to disruption of the nitrogen cycle, with species and functional genes involved in nitrification significantly reduced. Of the 11 targets we evaluated, we found the bacterial amoA gene indicative of potential ammonium oxidation, the most suitable indicator of toxicity. Dose-response modeling for this target generated an average effective concentration responsible for 20% change (EC20) of 155 mg kg(-1), which is consistent with previous Macquarie Island ecotoxicology assays. Unlike traditional single- species tolerance testing, bacterial targets allowed us to simultaneously evaluate more than 1,700 species from 39 phyla, inclusive of rare, sensitive, and functionally relevant portions of the community.

TI  - Contrasting soil microbial community functional structures in two major landscapes of the Tibetan alpine meadow
T2  - MICROBIOLOGYOPEN
AB  - The grassland and shrubland are two major landscapes of the Tibetan alpine meadow, a region very sensitive to the impact of global warming and anthropogenic perturbation. Herein, we report a study showing that a majority of differences in soil microbial community functional structures, measured by a functional gene array named GeoChip 4.0, in two adjacent shrubland and grassland areas, were explainable by environmental properties, suggesting that the harsh environments in the alpine grassland rendered niche adaptation important. Furthermore, genes involved in labile carbon degradation were more abundant in the shrubland than those of the grassland but genes involved in recalcitrant carbon degradation were less abundant, which was conducive to long-term carbon storage and sequestration in the shrubland despite low soil organic carbon content. In addition, genes of anerobic nitrogen cycling processes such as denitrification and dissimilatory nitrogen reduction were more abundant, shifting soil nitrogen cycling toward ammonium biosynthesis and consequently leading to higher soil ammonium contents. We also noted higher abundances of stress genes responsive to nitrogen limitation and oxygen limitation, which might be attributed to low total nitrogen and higher water contents in the shrubland. Together, these results provide mechanistic knowledge about microbial linkages to soil carbon and nitrogen storage and potential consequences of vegetation shifts in the Tibetan alpine meadow.

TI  - Vegetation, salinity, and tides drive nitrogen cycling in Mangrove plastispheres
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are emerging pollutants in mangrove ecosystems, with significant implications for microbial communities and nitrogen (N) cycling. However, the ecological processes shaping MP-associated microbial assemblages across environmental gradients remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted in situ and microcosm experiments to investigate microbial community composition and N-cycling gene abundance on three MP types-polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)-across salinity gradients (0-30 ppt) and under simulated tidal fluctuations over 35 days. High-throughput sequencing revealed distinct microbial communities on MPs compared to surrounding soils, dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Bacterial diversity in PE and PS peaked at moderate salinity (10 ppt), while PVC-associated diversity declined with salinity. Structural equation modeling showed that salinity directly and indirectly influenced MP-associated diversity via soil microbial communities. During tidal cycling, microbial diversity on MPs increased over time, contrasting with declining diversity in soils. PS biofilms exhibited the fastest community turnover (R-2 = 0.79). MPs harbored significantly higher abundances of 15 N-cycling genes (except hao) than soils (P < 0.05), with PS and PE supporting the highest gene levels under salinity gradients and tidal exposure. Denitrification and nitrification gene abundances peaked at intermediate salinity (20 ppt) and day 14 of tidal simulation, respectively. These findings demonstrate that MP type, vegetation, salinity, and hydrological dynamics jointly regulate plastisphere development and microbial N cycling, highlighting the multifaceted ecological impacts of MPs in mangrove ecosystems.

TI  - Seasonal Dynamics of Soil Bacterial Community under Long-Term Abandoned Cropland in Boreal Climate
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - The collapse of collective farming in Russia after 1990 led to the abandonment of 23% of the agricultural area. Microbial biomass is a transit pool between fresh and soil organic matter; therefore, structural changes in soil microbial community determine the carbon cycle processes caused by self-restoration of arable lands after abandonment. Here, we assessed the influence of monthly changes in moisture and temperature on the bacterial community structure and abundance in Retisols under long-term abandoned cropland. Two periods with pronounced differences in bacterial properties were revealed: the growing period from March to September and the dormant period from October to February. The growing period was characterized by higher bacterial abundance and diversity compared to the dormant period. The relative abundances of the bacterial community dominants (Alpha-, Gamma- and Deltaproteobacteria, subgroup 6 of phylum Acidobacteria) did not change significantly over the year, either in total or active communities. The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia increased in the growing period, whereas Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi were more abundant in the dormant period. The microbial gene abundances positively correlated with soil and air temperature, but not with soil moisture. Thus, the seasonal dynamics of soil microbial communities are closely related to soil temperature and should be considered when assessing carbon cycles in abandoned lands.

TI  - Association of ectomycorrhizal trees with high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio soils across temperate forests is driven by smaller nitrogen not larger carbon stocks
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. The distribution of mycorrhizal associations across biomes parallels a distinct gradient of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, raising the question of how mycorrhizal traits relate to ecosystem properties. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) hosts and fungi employ contrasting strategies for N acquisition, which may manifest in differences in soil C and N pools and/or soil C: N. However, cross-biome comparisons are confounded with climatic and edaphic gradients as well as phylogenetic and functional trait distributions of component plant species. Here, we test emerging hypotheses that soil C, N and C: N are related to the dominance of EM trees within a temperate forest region where AM and EM trees largely coexist but vary in local abundance.
   2. To determine the importance of mycorrhizal type on soil C and N, we analysed data from c. 1,000 forest inventory plots in the eastern United States. For each plot, we quantified the dominance of trees with different mycorrhizal associations and accounted for potentially confounding variables including phylogeny (angiosperm or gymnosperm), leaf N, soil clay content and climate. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to determine how these variables explained the patterns of soil C and N in the forest floor and mineral soil layers.
   3. Increasing EM dominance was associated with higher C: N across all soil layers. This relationship remained even after accounting for tree phylogeny, leaf N content, soil clay content, temperature and precipitation, which were all important for explaining soil C: N. However, this mycorrhizal pattern of soil C: N was not related to increases in soil C content; rather, increasing EM dominance was associated with reductions in soil N.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings are consistent with the proposition that mycorrhizal associations are related to terrestrial ecosystem properties. The mycorrhizal effect on soil C: N may result from differences in how arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plants interact with their fungal symbionts, decomposers and organic matter, to sustain differential cycling of C and N. Alternatively, these patterns could arise from differential success of the two mycorrhizal types in contrasting soil conditions; both processes may occur simultaneously, leading to a self-reinforcing positive feedback.

TI  - Impact of Different Farming Practices on Soil Nutrients and Functional Bacterial Guilds in Pigeonpea-Wheat Crop Rotation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Indiscriminate use of chemicals in agriculture impacts soil properties, significantly compromising microbial diversity. Therefore, integrating eco-friendly strategies with minimal adverse impact on soil microflora and increasing crop productivity are essential for sustainable agriculture. The study was designed to understand the impact of different farming practices on the rhizospheric bacterial populations involved in nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, soil nutrient contents, and the uptake of nutrients by plants. A 3-year field experiment was set up in a randomized block pattern with pigeonpea-wheat cropping system (PWCS). Conventional and organic farming management practices were selected with two sets of organic amendments (ORG1: farmyard manure, ORG2: leaf compost + crop residue), three sets of conventional treatment [CON1: farmyard manure + 50% NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), CON2: leaf compost + crop residue + 50% NPK, and CON3: 100% NPK], and control (C). Plants and soil were sampled at the harvest stage of the crops for three consecutive cropping seasons to assess the soil and plant nutrient contents, and N and P cycling bacterial guilds in the rhizospheres. The total NPK uptake by plants was higher in conventional treatments than in organic treatments for both the crops, compared to the control treatment. Bacterial genes involved in the N and P cycles positively correlated with organic farming practice in both crops. Overall, agricultural management strategies had a significant impact on PWCS. The amoA gene was the most sensitive marker contributing to the variation in the abundance of the functional bacterial community in response to agri-management practices. Soil and plant NPK content showed a significant positive correlation in the case of the pigeonpea crop. The study showed the positive effect of different organic amendments on rhizospheric bacterial guilds. The combination of organic amendments with reduced chemical fertilizers intensifies the functioning of the N and P cycles. Organic amendments and reduced chemical fertilizers in PWCS offer a promising avenue for improving nutrient cycling, enhancing soil health, and ultimately bolstering crop productivity.

TI  - Diversity and community structure of ammonia oxidizers in a marsh wetland of the northeast China
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - As an interface of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, wetland is a hotspot of the global nitrogen cycle. Ammonia oxidation is an essential part of the nitrogen cycle and is conducted by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Based on the amoA gene, the distribution and genetic diversity of AOA and AOB in the marsh wetland soil with different soil layers and vegetation had been investigated. The result showed that both soil layer and vegetation significantly influenced the diversity and abundance of AOA and AOB. AOB dominated numerically in all soil samples. The average bacterial amoA gene copies (2.62 x 10(9) copies/g dry soil) was 100-fold higher than the average archaeal amoA gene copies. In the soil sample under the Phragmites australis, the highest archaeal amoA gene was in depth 20-40 cm, whereas the bacterial amoA gene was more abundant in depth 0-20 cm. For the soil under Calamagrostis angustifolia, the highest archaeal and bacterial amoA gene were both detected in depth 0-20 cm. The dominated AOA was cluster AII, which was most related to the amoA gene found in aquatic habitat. Cluster BI accounted for 59.1% of bacterial amoA gene and it was related to the amoA gene found in the terrestrial habitat. CCA analysis revealed that NO3- was the main factor for AOA and AOB community structure in the P. australis soil. However, NO2- and NH4+ were important factors for AOA and AOB in the soil under C. angustifolia.

TI  - Microbial mechanisms of interactive climate-driven changes in soil N2O and CH4 fluxes: A global meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Soils represent both a source of and sink for greenhouse gases (GHG). Elevated temperature (eT) affects both the physical and biological factors that drive GHG emissions from soil and thus understanding the effects of rising global temperatures on terrestrial GHG emission is needed to predict future GHG emissions, and to identify mitigation strategies. However, uncertainty remains about the interactive effects of multiple climate factors across different ecosystems, complicating our ability to develop robust climate change projections. Therefore, a global meta-analysis of 1337 pairwise observations from 150 peer-reviewed publications (1990-2023) was conducted to assess the individual effect of eT and its combined effects with eCO2 (eT + eCO2), drought (eT + drought) and increased precipitation (eT + ePPT) on soil N2O and CH4 fluxes, microbial functional genes, and soil extracellular enzyme activities across grassland, cropland, and forestland ecosystems. Across the dataset, eT significantly increased N2O emissions (21%) and CH4 uptake (36%). Nitrogen cycling was consistently stimulated by eT, with NO3- and NH4+ and the abundance of amoA-AOB gene increasing by 6%, 10%, and 18%, respectively. Soil water content (SWC) was reduced, whereas increases of 9% in soil organic carbon (SOC), 14% in microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and 10% in total plant biomass were found under eT. The stimulation of soil N2O emissions by eT was maintained for all ecosystems when combined with other global change factors (ie., eT + eCO2, eT + ePPT, and eT + drought). By contrast, effects of eT on CH4 uptake and emissions were more variable when combined with other factors; for instance, eT + eCO2 and eT + ePPT suppressed CH4 uptake in grasslands. This study highlights the urgent need to study the microbial mechanisms responsible for combined global change effects on N2O and especially CH4 fluxes.

TI  - Metatranscriptomic reconstruction reveals RNA viruses with the potential to shape carbon cycling in soil
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Viruses impact nearly all organisms on Earth, with ripples of influence in agriculture, health, and biogeochemical processes. However, very little is known about RNA viruses in an environmental context, and even less is known about their diversity and ecology in soil, 1 of the most complex microbial systems. Here, we assembled 48 individual metatranscriptomes from 4 habitats within a planted soil sampled over a 22-d time series: Rhizosphere alone, detritosphere alone, rhizosphere with added root detritus, and unamended soil (4 time points and 3 biological replicates). We resolved the RNA viral community, uncovering a high diversity of viral sequences. We also investigated possible host organisms by analyzing metatranscriptome marker genes. Based on viral phylogeny, much of the diversity was Narnaviridae that may parasitize fungi or Leviviridae, which may infect Proteobacteria. Both host and viral communities appear to be highly dynamic, and rapidly diverged depending on experimental conditions. The viral and host communities were structured based on the presence of root litter. Clear temporal dynamics by Leviviridae and their hosts indicated that viruses were replicating. With this time-resolved analysis, we show that RNA viruses are diverse, abundant, and active in soil. When viral infection causes host cell death, it may mobilize cell carbon in a process that may represent an overlooked component of soil carbon cycling.

TI  - Impact of plant protection product applications on soil microbial nitrogen cycle function not fully captured by gene quantification
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The widespread use of plant protection products (PPPs) in agriculture raises concerns about their long-term impact on soil health and nitrogen (N) cycling. Current regulatory assessments focus mostly on single active ingredients and microbial mineralisation, ignoring the complexities of formulated PPPs and their influence on microbial functions. We investigated the effects of realistic PPP application scenarios on soil N cycling using a controlled incubation experiment with increasing PPP intensities, measuring potential nitrification (PN), denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), and N2O reduction capacity (NRC), alongside molecular analyses of key microbial genes involved in N-cycling. Functional assays were more sensitive to PPP exposure than gene abundances, indicating severe disruptions to N cycling. Among measured processes, PN was the most PPP-sensitive, showing substantial reductions across treatments. DEA and NRC were also strongly inhibited, exhibiting complex temporal patterns. While gene abundances were less responsive, there were significant positive correlations between the gene abundance of archaeal and bacterial ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) and PN, as well as between nitrite reductase (nirK) and DEA. Our findings underscore the importance of updated risk assessments that integrate both molecular and functional indicators. We propose a tiered approach, using gene quantification as an initial screening tool, followed by functional assays to capture biologically relevant changes. Post-registration monitoring of PPP mixtures under field conditions is likewise essential to address cumulative and long-term impacts. Overall, this study highlights the vulnerability of soil N cycling to PPP exposure and provides a framework to enhance environmental risk assessments aimed at safeguarding soil ecosystem functions.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria but not archaea influence soil nitrogen cycling in a semi-arid agricultural soil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Nitrification, a key pathway of nitrogen (N) loss from agricultural soils, is performed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). We examined the seasonal dynamics (2 years) of ammonia oxidizer gene abundances across a gradient of soil carbon (C) and N in a semi-arid soil after 8 years of tillage and crop residue treatments. AOB was more dominant than AOA in the surface soil, as AOA were undetected in 96% of samples. Seasonal variation in AOB abundance was related to substrate availability; AOB gene copy numbers increased at the end of the growing season (during summer fallow) following higher concentrations in dissolved organic matter soil water. This suggests increased co-location between AOB and substrate resources in pores still filled with water as the soils dried. AOB was however not statistically related to soil ammonium concentrations, soil water content, rainfall or temperature. Organic matter inputs enhanced AOB abundance independent of seasonal variation. AOB abundance was greatest in autumn and immediately preceding the start of the growing season, and coincided with elevated soil nitrate concentrations. The growth of the AOB population is likely to contribute to increased risk of N loss through leaching and/or denitrification at the start of the crop growing season following summer fallow.

TI  - Characterization of the responses of soil micro-organisms to azoxystrobin and the residue dynamics of azoxystrobin in wheat-corn rotation fields over two years
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Azoxystrobin, a high-efficiency and broad-spectrum strobilurin fungicide, has been widely used in global agri-cultural production. However, the effects of azoxystrobin on soil micro-organisms have scarcely been studied, and relevant experiments are usually conducted under laboratory conditions using active ingredient. Therefore, the effects of azoxystrobin on soil micro-organisms when applied to actual farmland are unknown. We sought to address this knowledge gap in this study, where we studied the effects of azoxystrobin on soil micro-organisms in a wheat-corn rotation field over two years. The results indicate that after two years of azoxystrobin application the activities of soil enzymes were inhibited, and the abundance of functional genes related to the nitrogen and carbon cycle were inhibited, which change the abundance of soil microbial bacteria of genera. As a consequence, the soil nitrogen and carbon cycles were disturbed. In addition, azoxystrobin inhibited the abundance of func-tional bacteria related to organic pollutant degradation and soil metabolism, where the rate of azoxystrobin degradation diminished over time. Moreover, azoxystrobin significantly inhibited the soil-culturable microbial population. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) indicated that the soil-culturable microbial population can be used as a sensitive indicator of the effect of azoxystrobin on soil micro-organisms. The final levels of azoxystrobin residues measured in grains were less than 0.004 mg/kg, lower than the maximum residue limits in European Union and China. The results of this study provide a basis for suggestions regarding the appropriate use of azoxystrobin in addition to support for elucidating the interaction between biological macromolecules and pollutants.

TI  - Changes in soil prokaryotic communities and nitrogen cycling functions along a groundwater table drawdown gradient in desert wetlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Desert wetlands are evolving into deserts by groundwater table (GWT) drawdown. However, the changes in microbial communities and functions during the GWT drawdown are unclear, which hinders the predictive power of biogeo-chemical processes across the desertification. Here, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, PICRUSt2 and qPCR were used to in-vestigate soil prokaryotic diversity, composition and nitrogen cycling gene abundance at four vegetation types [flooded swamp (FS), drained swamp (DS), desert grassland (DG), and bare sandy land (BS)] along a GWT decline gra-dient in the Mu Us Desert, northern China. Results showed that prokaryotic Shannon and Chao1 indexes were signif-icantly reduced at BS than those at FS (p < 0.05). Whereas no significant difference was observed between FS, DS and DG (p > 0.05). Distinct shifts in community composition were found along the GWT decline gradient. The dominant taxa gradually changed from obligate anaerobes and eutrophic microbes to facultative anaerobes, and finally to aero-bic, oligotrophic and drought-tolerant microbes. Soil moisture was the most important factor in regulating the commu-nities. In addition, GWT drawdown inhibited the relative abundance of genes involved in nitrogen fixation, assimilatory nitrite reduction, and nitrate oxidation, but enhanced the relative abundance of genes related to denitri-fication, assimilated nitrate reduction, ammonia oxidation and ammonification. Thus, GWT drawdown inhibits nitro-gen input potential and exacerbates nitrogen loss potential. These results help in understanding the succession characteristics of desert wetland desertification.

TI  - Response of nitrogen cycling to simulated climate change: differential responses along a subalpine ecotone
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - In situ nitrogen (N) transformations and N availability were examined over a four-year period in two soil microclimates (xeric and mesic) under a climate-warming treatment in a subalpine meadow/sagebrush scrub ecotone. Experimental plots that spanned the two soil microclimates were exposed to an in situ infrared (IR) climate change manipulation at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, near Crested Butte, Colorado. Although the two microclimates did not differ significantly in their rates of N transformations in the absence of heating, they differed significantly in their response to increased IR. Under a simulated warming in the sagebrush-dominated xeric microclimate, gross N mineralization rates doubled and immobilization rates increased by up to 60% over the first 2 years of the study but declined to predisturbance rates by the fourth year. This temporal pattern of gross mineralization rates correlated with a decline in SOM. Concurrently, rates of net mineralization rates in the heated plots were 60% higher than the controls after the first year. There were no differences in gross or net nitrification rates with heating in the xeric soils. In contrast to the xeric microclimate, there were no significant effects of heating on any N transformation rates in the mesic microclimate. The differing responses in N cycling rates of the two microclimate to the increased IR is most certainly the result of differences in initial soil moisture conditions and vegetation type and cover.

TI  - Microbial dormancy improves development and experimental validation of ecosystem model
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Climate feedbacks from soils can result from environmental change followed by response of plant and microbial communities, and/or associated changes in nutrient cycling. Explicit consideration of microbial life-history traits and functions may be necessary to predict climate feedbacks owing to changes in the physiology and community composition of microbes and their associated effect on carbon cycling. Here we developed the microbial enzyme-mediated decomposition (MEND) model by incorporating microbial dormancy and the ability to track multiple isotopes of carbon. We tested two versions of MEND, that is, MEND with dormancy (MEND) and MEND without dormancy (MEND_wod), against long-term (270 days) carbon decomposition data from laboratory incubations of four soils with isotopically labeled substrates. MEND_wod adequately fitted multiple observations (total C-CO2 and C-14-CO2 respiration, and dissolved organic carbon), but at the cost of significantly underestimating the total microbial biomass. MEND improved estimates of microbial biomass by 20-71% over MEND_wod. We also quantified uncertainties in parameters and model simulations using the Critical Objective Function Index method, which is based on a global stochastic optimization algorithm, as well as model complexity and observational data availability. Together our model extrapolations of the incubation study show that long-term soil incubations with experimental data for multiple carbon pools are conducive to estimate both decomposition and microbial parameters. These efforts should provide essential support to future field-and global-scale simulations, and enable more confident predictions of feedbacks between environmental change and carbon cycling.

TI  - Metagenomic Characterization of Soil Microbial Communities in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (Puerto Rico) and Implications for Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The phylogenetic and functional diversities of microbial communities in tropical rainforests and how these differ from those of temperate communities remain poorly described but are directly related to the increased fluxes of greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide (N2O) from the tropics. Toward dosing these knowledge gaps, we analyzed replicated shotgun metagenomes representing distinct life zones and an elevation gradient from four locations in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico. These soils had a distinct microbial community composition and lower species diversity compared to those of temperate grasslands or agricultural soils. In contrast to the overall distinct community composition, the relative abundances and nucleotide sequences of N2O reductases (nosZ) were highly similar between tropical forest and temperate soils. However, respiratory NO reductase (norB) was 2-fold more abundant in the tropical soils, which might be relatable to their greater N2O emissions. Nitrogen fixation (nifH) also showed higher relative abundance in rainforest than in temperate soils, i.e., 20% versus 0.1 to 0.3% of bacterial genomes in each soil type harbored the gene, respectively. Finally, unlike temperate soils, LEF soils showed little stratification with depth in the first 0 to 30 cm, with similar to 45% of community composition differences explained solely by location. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of spatial diversity and metabolic repertoire of tropical rainforest soil communities and should facilitate future ecological studies of these ecosystems.
   IMPORTANCE Tropical rainforests are the largest terrestrial sinks of atmospheric CO2 and the largest natural source of N2O emissions, two greenhouse gases that are critical for the climate. The microbial communities of rainforest soils that directly or indirectly, through affecting plant growth, contribute to these fluxes remain poorly described by cultured-independent methods. To close this knowledge gap, the present study applied shotgun metagenomics to samples selected from three distinct life zones within the Puerto Rico rainforest. The results advance our understanding of microbial community diversity in rainforest soils and should facilitate future studies of natural or manipulated perturbations of these critical ecosystems.

TI  - Earthworms stimulate nitrogen transformation in an acidic soil under different Cd contamination
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - In acidic Cd-contaminated soils, soil nitrogen conversion is inhibited and usually block nitrogen supply for plants. Earthworms are well known for improving soil properties and regulating various soil biogeochemical processes including nitrogen cycling. To figure out the effect and mechanisms of earthworms on soil nitrogen transformation in Cd-contaminated soil, ten treatments with and without A. robustus in five soil Cd concentration gradients were established. The tolerant concentration of A. robustus to Cd in the acidic soil is about 6 mg kg(-1). The potential ammonia oxidation of the acidic soils was very low, ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 sg NO2--N g(-1) Although AOA was more abundant in the acidic soil than AOB, AOA was inhibited by Cd pollution, while AOB showed some increase under Cd-stress. AOA may play a dominant role in ammonia oxidation in acidic soil, but the recovery of nitrification in Cd-contaminated acidic soil was probably due to the effect of AOB. Earthworms significantly increased soil pH, DOC, ammonium and PAO, thus promoted soil ammonification and potential nitrification, but had no significant effect on soil net nitrification. Correlation analysis results demonstrate that earthworms may promote soil PAO by increasing soil pH, NH4+-N content, and AOB abundance. This study could provide a theoretical basis for solving the problem of nitrogen-cycling-functional degradation and nitrogen supply in the process of phytoremediation of heavy metals-contaminated soils.

TI  - Plant invasion alters soil phosphorus cycling on tropical coral islands: Insights from Wollastonia biflora and Chromolaena odorata invasions
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Plants may modify soil biogeochemical properties that facilitate their invasion of new sites which may be mediated by soil microorganisms. We compared microbially-mediated soil phosphorus (P) cycling among sites with different degrees of invasion by Wollastonia biflora and Chromolaena odorata on two coral islands. Wollastonia biflora and C. odorata outcompeted all native species and invested more P in leaves (45-136% more than the native species). We found a decrease in the proportion of HCl-P and organic P, and a corresponding increase in the proportion of labile inorganic P (Pi) of the soil total P concentrations following plant invasion. Leaf P concentrations in invasive species were positively correlated with the proportion of labile Pi, suggesting that HCl-P and organic P were the major P sources for invasive plants, and that plant invasion increased soil P -cycling rates as a result of root carboxylate release (evidenced by greater leaf manganese concentrations) and enhanced soil alkaline phosphatase activity. The latter was confirmed by an increased soil phoD gene abundance after plant invasion. Soil P availability was elevated after plant invasion which was associated with increases in the release of root carboxylates and microbial activities that are involved in mobilization of HCl-P and mineralization of organic P, respectively, especially in the wet season. This, in turn, strongly increased leaf P concentrations of invasive species to sustain rapid plant growth, and presumably depriving competitors of P. These novel insights into soil P cycling through the enrichment of a specific soil microbial community and root carboxylate release in invaded ecosystems enhance our understanding of plant invasion mechanisms on coral islands.

TI  - Soil amendments promoting nitrifying bacteria recovery faster than the denitrifying bacteria at post soil fumigation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Chloropicrin (CP) is a soil fumigant that not only reduces disease-causing pathogenic microbes but regrettably also those that benefit soil quality and crop health.However, we have few knowledge on rapidly restoring populations of beneficial microbes suppressed by CP fumigation. Here we used genetic sequencing technology to monitor changes in the recovery of soil bacteria in response to ammonium sulfate added to the soil following CP fumigation. The results showed that regardless of the N fertilizer addition rate, the accumulated NH4+-N in CP fumigated soil was rapidly consumed within 42 d. The rapid reduction in NH4+-N coincided with the observed recovery nitrogen-cycling microorganisms, especially the nitrification bacteria AOA and AOB that contributed to the formation of NH4+-N. Additionally, we further observed that the resilience index of nitrifying bacteria (AOB and AOA) was greater than the resilience index of denitrifying bacteria that contain the denitrification genes nirS, nirK and nosZ (0.12 to 0.55 vs.-0.27 to 0.073). These results revealed that N fertilizer stimulated the recovery of nitrifying bacteria more than denitrifying bacteria. Our research suggests that ammonium sulfate applied to CP fumigated soil could be used commercially to improve soil health as a result of an increase in beneficial microbes.

TI  - Response of soil respiration and its components to experimental warming and water addition in a temperate Sitka spruce forest ecosystem
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Future climate change is expected to alter the terrestrial carbon cycle through its impact on soil respiration. In this study, we determined the responses of soil respiration and its components to experimental warming with or without water addition. A replicated in situ heating (similar to 2 degrees C above ambient soil temperatures) and water addition (170 mm in total each year) experiment was carried out for the first time in a temperate plantation forest of Sitka spruce over the period 2014-2016. R-h was measured inside deep collars (35 cm deep) that excluded root growth, while R-s was measured using the static chamber approach and near-surface collars (5 cm deep) and R-a calculated by subtracting R-h from total soil respiration (R-s). Experimental warming significantly increased R-s, R-h and R-h/R-s, but had no effect on R-a. In contrast, none of the respiration components were affected by water addition. Warming increased annual R-h by 62% but had no effect on R-a. Overall, warming did not significantly increase annual R-s. Warming showed a stronger impact on R-s in the non-growing season but had a smaller impact in the growing season. Warming increased R-a in the non-growing season but decreased it in the growing season. The effects of warming on R(h )were similar for the two periods. Our results highlight the differential response of R-a and R-h to warming, which was mediated by water addition or season. For this and other similar forest sites that don't experience water limitation, global warming may have a positive feedback on atmospheric CO2 concentrations through enhanced soil respiration.

TI  - Microbial specialists in high-altitude forest soils: environmental sensitivity and ecological significance
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB  - Microorganisms are essential contributors to the forest ecosystems of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, encompassing generalists, intermediates, and specialists. Investigating the characteristics and drivers of these microbial sub-communities across varying elevations is essential for understanding their ecological functions in high-altitude forest soils. This study examines the diversity patterns, assembly processes, environmental adaptations, and potential functions of bacterial and fungal sub-communities along an elevation gradient from 3900 m to the timberline on Shergyla Mountain, China. The findings revealed notable differences between low and high elevations in the diversity and composition of microbial sub-communities. According to neutral and null models, generalists, characterized by the widest niche width and highest migration rates, were primarily influenced by stochastic processes (71.9%). In contrast, deterministic factors, including homogeneous and variable selection, exerted a stronger effect on the assembly of specialists (51.0%). Elevation and nutrient availability emerged as key environmental drivers shaping microbial sub-communities, particularly for specialists, while generalists experienced fewer constraints from environmental factors. Network analysis further demonstrated that habitat specialists occupy central positions within microbial networks, playing a pivotal role in maintaining network stability. Additionally, nitrogen cycling genes-specifically nifH, amoA, nirS and nosZ-exhibited a U-shaped distribution across the elevation gradient and showed a substantial correlation (p < 0.05) with the Chao1 and Shannon indices of bacterial specialists. The results enhance our knowledge of microbial community dynamics and underscore the crucial ecological role of microbial specialists in the ecosystems of high-altitude forests.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen cycling immediately following bark beetle outbreaks in southwestern ponderosa pine forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Bark beetle infestation is a well-known cause of historical low-level disturbance in southwestern ponderosa pine forests, but recent fire exclusion and increased tree densities have enabled large-scale bark beetle outbreaks with unknown consequences for ecosystem function. Uninfested and beetle-infested plots (n=10 pairs of plots on two aspects) of ponderosa pine were compared over one growing season in the Sierra Ancha Experimental Forest, AZ to determine whether infestation was correlated with differences in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools and fluxes in aboveground biomass and soils. Infested plots had at least 80% of the overstory ponderosa pine trees attacked by bark beetles within 2 years of our measurements. Both uninfested and infested plots stored similar to 9 kg C m(-2) in aboveground tree biomass, but infested plots held 60% of this aboveground tree biomass in dead trees, compared to 5% in uninfested plots. We hypothesized that decreased belowground C allocation following beetle-induced tree mortality would alter soil respiration rates, but this hypothesis was not supported; throughout the growing season, soil respiration in infested plots was similar to uninfested plots. In contrast, several results supported the hypothesis that premature needlefall from infested trees provided a pulse of low C:N needlefall that altered soil N cycling. The C:N mass ratio of pine needlefall in infested plots (similar to 45) was lower than uninfested plots (similar to 95) throughout the growing season. Mineral soils from infested plots had greater laboratory net nitrification rates and field resin bag ammonium accumulation than uninfested plots. As bark beetle outbreaks become increasingly prevalent in western landscapes, longer-term biogeochemical studies on interactions with other disturbances (e.g. fire, harvesting, etc.) will be required to predict changes in ecosystem structure and function.

TI  - Soil nitrogen cycling in forests invaded by the shrub Rosa multiflora: importance of soil moisture and invasion density
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Invasive plants often alter ecosystem function and processes, especially soil N cycling. In eastern United States forests, the shrub Rosa multiflora ("rose") is a dominant invader, yet potential effects on N cycling are poorly understood. Moreover, invasive plant management can impact soil N cycling by decreasing plant N uptake and disturbing the soil. The objectives of this study were to evaluate N cycling along a gradient of rose invasion (observational) and investigate potential changes to N cycling (manipulative) under four different management strategies: (1) do nothing (the control), (2) invasive plant removal, (3) removal followed by native seed mix addition, (4) removal, native seed mix, and chipped rose stem addition. We selected three forest sites experiencing a Low, Medium, or High amount of shrub invasion, and measured N cycling in the early (June) and late (September) growing seasons. We found N was immobilized in June and mineralized in September. One year after experimental management, removal alone had no effect on N cycling compared to control plots, but addition of native seed mix and chipped stems reduced early-season nitrification in our Medium invasion site. Our findings suggest that rose invasion may increase N cycling rates when soils are dry, which may occur more frequently with future climate change. In addition, N cycling responds differentially to management in the year following invasive plant removal, but most noticeably under moderate rose invasion.

TI  - Modelling the role of urban forest in the regulation of carbon balance in an industrial area of India
T2  - ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA
AB  - The increase in greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere contributes to climate change. People and policy makers are becoming more interested in the role of urban trees in regulating the global carbon cycle. Carbon dioxide emissions from anthropogenic sources are mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels, which are major contributors to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Therefore, a better understanding of the carbon sequestration process by urban forests and its exchange between air and soil is the first step to offsetting the impacts of climate change in urban areas.Here, a dynamic model was constructed including the carbon stock of forest, litter carbon and soil organic carbon pool. The study emphasized the relationship between the three carbon pools. The monthly dynamics of the pools were studied. A sensitivity analysis was performed followed by calibration and validation. The results showed that the mean growth rate of forest biomass was the most sensitive factor, followed by the decomposition rate and the uptake rate of organic carbon by detritivores.If the biomass of the existing forest is maintained sustainably, more carbon dioxide could be sequestered. In addition, the model showed that afforestation in the Asansol-Durgapur Planning Area would increase the carbon stocks of the forest and to some extent offset the problem of carbon dioxide release from the nearby coal mines and other factories. In the near future, the model will benefit forest managers in carrying out urban management in the Earth's tropical belt.

TI  - Changes in root-exudate-induced respiration reveal a novel mechanism through which drought affects ecosystem carbon cycling
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Root exudates play an important role in ecosystem response to climate change, but the functional consequences of drought-induced changes in the quality of root exudates are unknown. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap in a unique experimental approach. We subjected two common grassland species that differ widely in their growth strategies and root systems, the grass Holcus lanatus and the forb Rumex acetosa, to 2 wk of drought. We collected root exudates and soils at the end of the drought and after 2 wk of recovery and readded all root exudates to all soils in a fully reciprocal set-up to measure root-exudate-induced respiration. We found that soil treatment was unimportant for determining root-exudate-induced respiration. By contrast, root exudates collected from plants that had experienced drought clearly triggered more soil respiration than exudates from undroughted plants. Importantly, this increased respiration compensated for the lower rates of root exudation in droughted plants. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism through which drought can continue to affect ecosystem carbon cycling, and a potential plant strategy to facilitate regrowth through stimulating microbial activity. These findings have important implications for understanding plant and ecosystem response to drought.

TI  - Unveiling unique microbial nitrogen cycling and nitrification driver in coastal Antarctica
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Largely removed from anthropogenic delivery of nitrogen (N), Antarctica has notably low levels of nitrogen. Though our understanding of biological sources of ammonia have been elucidated, the microbial drivers of nitrate (NO3 -) cycling in coastal Antarctica remains poorly understood. Here, we explore microbial N cycling in coastal Antarctica, unraveling the biological origin of NO3 - via oxygen isotopes in soil and lake sediment, and through the reconstruction of 1968 metagenome-assembled genomes from 29 microbial phyla. Our analysis reveals the metabolic potential for microbial N2 fixation, nitrification, and denitrification, but not for anaerobic ammonium oxidation, signifying a unique microbial N-cycling dynamic. We identify the predominance of complete ammonia oxidizing (comammox) Nitrospira, capable of performing the entire nitrification process. Their adaptive strategies to the Antarctic environment likely include synthesis of trehalose for cold stress, high substrate affinity for resource utilization, and alternate metabolic pathways for nutrient-scarce conditions. We confirm the significant role of comammox Nitrospira in the autotrophic, nitrification process via 13C-DNA-based stable isotope probing. This research highlights the crucial contribution of nitrification to the N budget in coastal Antarctica, identifying comammox Nitrospira clade B as a nitrification driver.
   This study reveals a unique microbial nitrogen cycling process in Antarctica's coastal regions, with nitrification playing a significant role. The research notably identifies comammox Nitrospira clade B as a key driver of this process.

TI  - Bacterial community composition and diversity of two different forms of an organic residue of bioenergy crop
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - The use of residue of sugarcane ethanol industry named vinasse in fertirrigation is an established and widespread practice in Brazil. Both non-concentrated vinasse (NCV) and concentrated vinasse (CV) are used in fertirrigation, particularly to replace the potassium fertilizer. Although studies on the chemical and organic composition of vinasse and their impact on nitrous oxide emissions when applied in soil have been carried out, no studies have evaluated the microbial community composition and diversity in different forms of vinasse. We assessed the bacterial community composition of NCV and CV by non-culturable and culturable approaches. The non-culturable bacterial community was assessed by next generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and culturable community by isolation of bacterial strains and molecular and biochemical characterization. Additionally, we assessed in the bacterial strains the presence of genes of nitrogen cycle nitrification and denitrification pathways. The microbial community based on 16S rRNA sequences of NCV was overrepresented by Bacilli and Negativicutes while CV was mainly represented by Bacilli class. The isolated strains from the two types of vinasse belong to class Bacilli, similar to Lysinibacillus, encode for nirK gene related to denitrification pathway. This study highlights the bacterial microbial composition particularly in CV what residue is currently recycled and recommended as a sustainable practice in sugarcane cultivation in the tropics.

TI  - Effects of emergent aquatic plants on nitrogen transformation processes and related microorganisms in a constructed wetland in northern China
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims Wetland plants affect ammonia-oxidation rate (AOR) and nitrogen-fixation rate (NFR), resulting in changes in plant-available nitrogen and wetland nitrogen-cycling. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms and influencing factors associated with ammonium oxidation and nitrogen fixation in response to wetland-emergent aquatic plants. Methods A field experiment was conducted to study the response of activity, abundance, and community structure of ammonia-oxidizers and diazotrophs to three wetland-emergent aquatic plants in summer and autumn. The root exudates and soil physicochemical properties were determined due to their important role in rhizosphere interactions. Results AOR and NFR were significantly higher in rhizosphere than in bulk soils. The increases of AOR and NFR in rhizosphere were significantly positively affected by oxidation-reduction potential, additionally, NFR was also significantly affected by sugar-containing root exudates. Furthermore, NFR strongly correlated with diazotroph abundance, whereas AOR was linearly correlated with ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) activity and mostly determined by a specific AOA taxon. Conclusions Emergent plant rhizosphere exhibited strong positive effects on AOR and NFR by altering community structure and abundance of related microorganisms. Release of available oxygen and carbon in plant rhizospheres is vital for promoting ammonium oxidation and nitrogen fixation and might further mediate wetlands nitrogen-cycling.

TI  - An evaluation of primers for detecting denitrifiers via their functional genes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Microbial populations provide nitrogen cycling ecosystem services at the nexus of agriculture, environmental quality and climate change. Denitrification, in particular, impacts socio-environmental systems in both positive and negative ways, through reduction of aquatic and atmospheric nitrogen pollution, but also reduction of soil fertility and production of greenhouse gases. However, denitrification rates are quite variable in time and space, and therefore difficult to model. Microbial ecology is working to improve the predictive ecology of denitrifiers by quantifying and describing the diversity of microbial functional groups. However, metagenomic sequencing has revealed previously undescribed diversity within these functional groups, and highlighted a need to reevaluate coverage of existing DNA primers for denitrification functional genes. We provide here a comprehensive in silico evaluation of primer sets that target diagnostic genes in the denitrification pathway. This analysis makes use of current DNA sequence data available for each functional gene. It contributes a comparative analysis of the strengths and limitations of each primer set for describing denitrifier functional groups. This analysis identifies genes for which development of new tools is needed, and aids in interpretation of existing datasets, both of which will facilitate application of molecular methods to further develop the predictive ecology of denitrifiers.

TI  - NRT1.1B mediates rice plant growth and soil microbial diversity under different nitrogen conditions
T2  - AMB EXPRESS
AB  - Interactions between microorganisms and plants can stimulate plant growth and promote nitrogen cycling. Nitrogen fertilizers are routinely used in agriculture to improve crop growth and yield; however, poor use efficiency impairs the optimal utilization of such fertilizers. Differences in the microbial diversity and plant growth of rice soil under different nitrogen application conditions and the expression of nitrogen-use efficiency-related genes have not been previously investigated. Therefore, this study investigates how nitrogen application and nitrogen-use efficiency-related gene NRT1.1B expression affect the soil microbial diversity and growth indices of two rice varieties, Huaidao 5 and Xinhuai 5. In total, 103,463 and 98,427 operational taxonomic units were detected in the soils of the Huaidao 5 and Xinhuai 5 rice varieties, respectively. The Shannon and Simpson indices initially increased and then decreased, whereas the Chao and abundance-based coverage estimator indices decreased after the application of nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilization also reduced soil bacterial diversity and richness, as indicated by the reduced abundances of Azotobacter recorded in the soils of both rice varieties. Nitrogen application initially increased and then decreased the grain number per panicle, yield per plant, root, stem, and leaf nitrogen, total nitrogen content, glutamine synthetase, nitrate reductase, urease, and root activities of both varieties. Plant height showed positive linear trends in response to nitrogen application, whereas thousand-grain weights showed a negative trend. Our findings may be used to optimize nitrogen fertilizer use for rice cultivation and develop crop-variety-specific strategies for nitrogen fertilizer application.

TI  - Deforestation impacts network co-occurrence patterns of microbial communities in Amazon soils
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Co-occurrence networks allow for the identification of potential associations among species, which may be important for understanding community assembly and ecosystem functions. We employed this strategy to examine prokaryotic co-occurrence patterns in the Amazon soils and the response of these patterns to land use change to pasture, with the hypothesis that altered microbial composition due to deforestation will mirror the co-occurrence patterns across prokaryotic taxa. In this study, we calculated Spearman correlations between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and only robust correlations were considered for network construction (-0.80 P 0.80, adjusted P< 0.01). The constructed network represents distinct forest and pasture components, with altered compositional and topological features. A comparative analysis between two representative modules of these contrasting ecosystems revealed novel information regarding changes to metabolic pathways related to nitrogen cycling. Our results showed that soil physicochemical properties such as temperature, C/N and H++Al3+ had a significant impact on prokaryotic communities, with alterations to network topologies. Taken together, changes in co-occurrence patterns and physicochemical properties may contribute to ecosystem processes including nitrification and denitrification, two important biogeochemical processes occurring in tropical forest systems.
   Deforestation of Amazon rainforest alters soil microbial community and physicochemical properties, which subsequently alter microbially mediated biogeochemical processes, notably nitrogen cycle. The Amazon Rainforest is the largest terrestrial ecosystem on Earth and deforestation changes co-occurrence patterns of microbial communities with potential consequences to biogeochemical cycles

TI  - Variation in Soil Methane Fluxes and Comparison between Two Forests in China
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Methane (CH4) is a vital greenhouse gas with a 28-fold higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide when considering a molar basis for the time horizon of 100 years. Here, we investigated the variation of soil CH4 fluxes, soil physiochemical properties, and CH4-related bacteria community composition of two forests in China. We measured CH4 fluxes using static chambers and analyzed soil bacterial communities using next-generation high-throughput sequencing in a temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest at Baotianman Nature Reserve (TBDF-BTM) and a tropical rainforest at Jianfengling National Natural Reserve (TRF-JFL). Our results showed that the soils from both sites were CH4 sinks. Significant variation in soil CH4 fluxes was found at TBDF-BTM exclusively, while no seasonal variation in the CH4 uptake was observed at TRF-JFL. The CH4 fluxes at TBDF-BTM were substantially higher than those at TRF-JFL during all seasons. One genus of methanotrophs and three genera of methylotrophs were detected at both sites, though they had no direct relationship with soil CH4 fluxes. Water-filled pore space and soil total carbon content are the main factors controlling the soil CH4 fluxes at TBDF-BTM. At TRF-JFL, the soil CH4 fluxes showed no significant correlations with any of the soil properties. This study improves our understanding of soil CH4 fluxes and their influencing factors in forests in different climatic zones and provides a reference for future investigation of forest soil CH4 fluxes, the forest ecosystem carbon cycle, and the forest CH4 model.

TI  - Large-scale evidence for microbial response and associated carbon release after permafrost thaw
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Permafrost thaw could trigger the release of greenhouse gases through microbial decomposition of the large quantities of carbon (C) stored within frozen soils. However, accurate evaluation of soil C emissions from thawing permafrost is still a big challenge, partly due to our inadequate understanding about the response of microbial communities and their linkage with soil C release upon permafrost thaw. Based on a large-scale permafrost sampling across 24 sites on the Tibetan Plateau, we employed meta-genomic technologies (GeoChip and Illumina MiSeq sequencing) to explore the impacts of permafrost thaw (permafrost samples were incubated for 11 days at 5 degrees C) on microbial taxonomic and functional communities, and then conducted a laboratory incubation to investigate the linkage of microbial taxonomic and functional diversity with soil C release after permafrost thaw. We found that bacterial and fungal alpha diversity decreased, but functional gene diversity and the normalized relative abundance of C degradation genes increased after permafrost thaw, reflecting the rapid microbial response to permafrost thaw. Moreover, both the microbial taxonomic and functional community structures differed between the thawed permafrost and formerly frozen soils. Furthermore, soil C release rate over five month incubation was associated with microbial functional diversity and C degradation gene abundances. By contrast, neither microbial taxonomic diversity nor community structure exhibited any significant effects on soil C release over the incubation period. These findings demonstrate that permafrost thaw could accelerate C emissions by altering the function potentials of microbial communities rather than taxonomic diversity, highlighting the crucial role of microbial functional genes in mediating the responses of permafrost C cycle to climate warming.

TI  - The effects of elevated atmospheric humidity on soil respiration components in a young silver birch forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - The predicted increase in precipitation at northern latitudes is an important factor affecting the functioning of forest ecosystems, yet the influence of increased atmospheric humidity on the forest ecosystem carbon cycle is still largely unknown. Our objectives were to determine the effect of elevated atmospheric humidity on soil respiration in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) plantations in a Free Air Humidity Manipulation experimental facility (FAHM). Soil respiration was monitored monthly from May to October, in 2008 and 2009 in three control and in three misting plots; soil temperature and soil moisture were measured simultaneously. Fine-root and rhizome biomass of the understory was measured by sequential soil cores. Soil microbial biomass and basal respiration were measured using manometric respirometers. After the first two years of manipulation, humidification led to lower soil respiration. Soil temperature was the main factor influencing seasonal dynamics of soil respiration, describing up to 75% of the total variation of soil respiration. Soil moisture had a weak negative effect on soil respiration. Humidification caused a remarkable increase in below-ground biomass and the production of the understory, and a 28% increase in the basal respiration of microbes. However, above-ground biomass and root turnover rate of the understory were almost unchanged. Hence, elevated atmospheric humidity significantly affects carbon cycle of deciduous forest. However, further studies are necessary for a better understanding of soil respiration response to changes in atmospheric humidity, in order to predict carbon balance in changing climate conditions.

TI  - Development of energetic and enzymatic limitations on microbial carbon cycling in soils
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) constitutes an important reservoir in the global carbon cycle that is vulnerable to transformation and loss from land use and climate change. Anoxic conditions protect SOC from microbial degradation through limiting the energetics of respiration and inhibiting extracellular oxidative enzymes. Given growing evidence of prevalent anaerobic microsites in upland soils, we designed an experiment testing the development of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) signatures of energetic and enzymatic limitations on microbial carbon utilization across simulated soil aggregates or peds. Reactors comprised a soil column "aggregate" underlying an advective "macropore" channel. Soils received downward diffusive inputs of aerated porewater media with added nitrate, sulfate, or no amendment-where native ferrihydrite served as dominant anaerobic terminal electron acceptor (TEA). After 40 days, added nitrate resulted in highest bulk respiration and DOC production while sulfate did not differ from the control. Nominal oxidation state of carbon (NOSC) was higher (more favorable) with added TEAs at soil surfaces and decreased with depth, while NOSC in the non-amended soil remained lower and constant with depth. DOC generally increased with depth, which along with decreasing NOSC values indicates joint electron-donor and acceptor control over respiration energetics. Of all organic compound classes, only the relative abundance of phenolics increased between 0 and 0.5 cm depth, which aligns with the oxic-anoxic transition and suggests oxidative enzyme inhibition. Our results suggest that oxygen limitation within upland soil aggregates may preserve SOC via both energetic and enzymatic C protection mechanisms, which are vulnerable upon exposure to oxygen.

TI  - Impact of Agroforestry Practices on Soil Microbial Diversity and Nutrient Cycling in Atlantic Rainforest Cocoa Systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Microorganisms are critical indicators of soil quality due to their essential role in maintaining ecosystem services. However, anthropogenic activities can disrupt the vital metabolic functions of these microorganisms. Considering that soil biology is often underestimated and traditional assessment methods do not capture its complexity, molecular methods can be used to assess soil health more effectively. This study aimed to identify the changes in soil microbial diversity and activity under different cocoa agroforestry systems, specially focusing on taxa and functions associated to carbon and nitrogen cycling. Soils from three different cocoa agroforestry systems, including a newly established agroforestry with green fertilization (GF), rubber (Hevea brasiliensis)-cocoa intercropping (RC), and cocoa plantations under Cabruca (cultivated under the shave of native forest) (CAB) were analyzed and compared using metagenomic and metaproteomic approaches. Samples from surrounding native forest and pasture were used in the comparison, representing natural and anthropomorphic ecosystems. Metagenomic analysis revealed a significant increase in Proteobacteria and Basidiomycota and the genes associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction in the RC and CAB areas. The green fertilization area showed increased nitrogen cycling activity, demonstrating the success of the practice. In addition, metaproteomic analyses detected enzymes such as dehydrogenases in RC and native forest soils, indicating higher metabolic activity in these soils. These findings underscore the importance of soil management strategies to enhance soil productivity, diversity, and overall soil health. Molecular tools are useful to demonstrate how changes in agricultural practices directly influence the microbial community, affecting soil health.

TI  - Influence of Soil and Climate on Carbon Cycling and Microbial Activity of a Heterogeneous Tropical Soil
T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - This study presents differentiated behaviors of two facies of a tropical soil. Soil characteristics and microbiota, field-monitored for two years, showed that different water velocities originated diverse responses to rainfall; altered oxygenation and nutrient conditions resulted in differentiated carbon availability and cycling. The facies with lower carbon and water content supported a 35% less active but 3-4 times more efficient microbiota. Higher soil moisture in the silty facies (67%) led to increased carbon (12-fold) degradation and availability (3-fold), but not higher biomass. Soil and environmental conditions apparently rule microbiota metabolic state, hence the need to evaluate them as microbial growth support.

TI  - Measures to reduce land subsidence and greenhouse gas emissions in peatlands: A Dutch case study
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Worldwide, peatlands suffer from land subsidence and greenhouse gas emissions due to artificial drainage inducing peat decomposition. Under anthropogenic climate change, these issues require measures to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and protect low-lying areas from increasing flood risk. Tighter control of groundwater levels is required, both within existing agricultural systems and through the development of new agricultural systems suitable for farming under high groundwater levels or inundation. The complexity and value-laden nature of the issue warrants the development of a comprehensive overview of potential and side effects of measures. In this paper such an overview is synthesized based on a mixed-method approach for a special case, The Netherlands. The Dutch peatlands comprise extensive land areas in the low-lying west and north of The Netherlands. The case is exceptional as most of these peatlands lie below sea level, sustain worldclass intensive dairy farming and are subject to multiple other environmental, economic and societal challenges. Here, land subsidence increases flood risk, salt-water intrusion and the costs of water management, particularly under global climate change. To mitigate land subsidence, both technical measures and alternative land uses can be envisaged. However, the literature about these is fragmented, complicating a careful identification and selection of measures. To address this knowledge gap, we review 27 technical measures and alternative land use options and synthesize evidence and insights for 15 effects. Technical measures allowing continuation of existing dairy farming provide relatively low-risk interventions for farmers, but will only reduce, not stop land subsidence and greenhouse gas emissions. Alternative land-use options, particularly paludiculture, are in a start-up stage of development and can stop land subsidence. However, more research is required to reduce and control methane and potential nitrous oxide emissions during inundation required for crops such as (narrowleaf) cattail and azolla. Paludiculture can provide ecosystem services related to water management and nutrient status, as well as raw materials for a bio-based economy. Gradual transitions in space and time between farming and nature can be envisaged, providing incentives to diversify land use in the Dutch peatlands. This case study identifies key questions and provides valuable insights for peatland management worldwide. Reducing land subsidence and greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands is feasible, but requires thoughtful interventions that cautiously make and align trade-offs between various interests and uncertainties.

TI  - Effects of Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu on Soil Enzyme Activity and Soil Properties Related to Agricultural Land-Use Practices in Karst Area Contaminated by Pb-Zn Tailings
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB  - In order to study the impact of Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu released by Pb-Zn tailings on soil enzymes and soil properties involving soil carbon and nitrogen cycle processes, 32 soil samples were collected from 2 different types of agricultural fields (one for growing corn and one for growing rice) contaminated by Pb-Zn tailings close to Sidi village in southwestern China. The results revealed that the paddy fields were seriously contaminated by Pb-Zn tailings compared with cornfields. Under the Pb-Zn tailings contamination, the population of fungi and actinomycetes as well as the activities of the soil enzymes (urease, invertase, and cellulase) in cornfields were significantly higher than those in the paddy fields. In addition, the results from path analysis showed that urease, invertase, and acid phosphatase were negatively correlated with DTPA-extractable Cd, Pb, and Zn (the direct path coefficients were -0.336, -0.314, and -0.591, respectively). Soil microorganisms and enzyme activities involving soil organic carbon and nitrogen decomposition and stabilization were decreased due to the toxic Pb-Zn tailings. Therefore, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen accumulate and an "elusive" carbon and nitrogen pool forms in the paddy fields compared with cornfields in the Pb-Zn tailings-contaminated karst area.

TI  - Response of dissolved inorganic carbon dynamics to simulated tidal hydrological processes in coastal wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - To clarify the impacts of tidal hydrological process shifts caused by sea level rise on the blue carbon cycle, a typical coastal wetland in Jiaozhou Bay was selected for this study. The soils of Suaeda salsa (SS) and Phragmites australis (PA) wetlands were collected to simulate the effects of three types of tidal hydrological processes (Neap tide group, NT; Middle tide group, MT; Spring tide group, ST) on the soil-water dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dynamic. The results showed that the concentration of water dissolved inorganic carbon (WDIC) increased rapidly (115% higher) at early stage (days 0-4) under the influence of the tidal hydrological processes. Significant differences were found in WDIC concentration during different tidal hydrological processes (P < 0.05), which were expressed as MT (52.7 +/- 13.3 mg L-1) > ST (52.5 +/- 12.9 mg L-1) > NT (48.4 +/- 10.1 mg L-1). After experiencing the tidal hydrological processes, the soil DIC content showed a net accumulation (55.1 +/- 1.29 mg L-1 vs. 46.7 +/- 1.76 mg L-1, P < 0.001), whereas the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) decreased (2.73 +/- 1.64 mg L-1 vs. 4.61 +/- 1.71 mg L-1), which may be attributed to the dissolution of SIC caused by the uptake of CO2 to form DIC. The accumulation of soil DIC was directly related to the SIC (lambda = 1.03, P < 0.01), and indirectly related to soil nutrients (SOC substrate, lambda = -0.003) and microbes (microbial biomass, lambda = -0.10), and was mainly dominated by abiotic processes (abiotic: 58.1 +/- 1.8% to 82.7 +/- 2.46% vs. biotic: 17.4 +/- 2.46% to 41.9 +/- 1.76%). The increase of tidal frequency generally inhibited the accumulation of soil DIC content and promoted the output of WDIC. However, the response of soil DIC in different wetland types to tidal frequency was divergent, which was mainly regulated by the trade-off between soil nutrients and SIC content. Taken together, tidal hydrological processes and their frequency changes reshaped DIC dynamics, promoted the dissolution of SIC and the potential uptake of CO2. These findings enhance the comprehension of the inorganic carbon cycle within coastal wetlands, particularly amidst the backdrop of climate change and the rising sea levels.

TI  - Effects of Elevation Gradient on Soil Carbon and Nitrogen in a Typical Karst Region of Chongqing, Southwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Elevation changes create gradients in abiotic factors, which in turn affect soil erosion and carbon cycling. However, how elevation changes control soil ecological processes through temperature and the mechanism that affects the carbon cycle remain unclear. Therefore, we have studied the distribution of temperature, bulk density (BD), soil pH, mean weight diameter (MWD), clay, and diversity of soil fungal community diversity, and discussed the critical factors affecting soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) in a typical karst mountainous area. The results showed that the dominant phyla were Ascomycota (42.28%), Mortierellomycota (20.6%), Basidiomycota (17.83%), and Rozellomycota (11.82%). The elevation distributions of MWD, fungal diversity, the rate of SOC and N stocks change per temperature index, and SOC and N stocks all exhibited unimodal patterns. Additionally, temperature, fungal diversity, MWD, BD, and clay were the dominant factors explaining the variability of SOC and N, and SOC and N had a positive relationship with pH, BD, MWD, clay-silt content, warmth index, and Sobs and Shannon diversity. Analyses showed that the warmth index regulated soil aggregates through fungal diversity and combined with BD to affect carbon sequestration, which was controlled by clay, the C:N ratio, and pH during the process. These conclusions have important implications for improving the SOC sequestration capacity in karst mountainous areas.

TI  - Biochar-mediated remediation of low-density polyethylene microplastic-polluted soil-plant systems: Role of phosphorus and protist community responses
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - While the prevalent utilization of plastic products has enabled social advancement, the concomitant microplastics (MPs) pollution presents a serious threat to environmental security and public health. Protists, as regulators of soil microorganisms, are also capable of responding most rapidly to changes in the soil environment. The amelioration mechanisms of biochar in the soil-plant systems polluted by low-density polyethylene microplastics (LDPE-MPs) and the response of protist communities in the soil-plant systems polluted by MPs remain unclear. In this field experiment, the same concentration of biochar (2 %) was applied to remediate different concentrations (1 % and 10 %) of LDPE-MPs pollution in cherry radish soil. The main results indicate that, when compared with the treatment of applying biochar to address high-level LDPE-MPs polluted soil (BP2), the remediation of low-level LDPE-MPs polluted soil by biochar (BP1) led to a 62.02 % reduction in soil available phosphorus. Meanwhile, the abundance of phoD and the activity of alkaline phosphatase increased by 127.75 % and 22.57 % respectively. Moreover, in contrast to BP2, the root biomass and phosphorus content of cherry radish in BP1 increased by 52.80 % and 42.86 % respectively. For protist communities, their structure, niche width, and assembly were altered. The interaction between biochar and LDPE-MPs influenced phosphorus cycling, and protists were closely associated with these processes. Therefore, soil phosphorus cycling indicators and protist community may be important indicators for biochar amelioration on soil MPs pollution. The study highlights the importance of considering these factors for better farmland management in the context of MPs pollution, which is significant for sustainable agriculture and environmental protection.

TI  - Specific Features of the Pool of Hydrolytic Enzymes in Soils of Agricultural Terraces in the Eastern Caucasus
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - A study of the influence of farming practices in the Middle Ages (X-XV AD) on the activities of 11 hydrolytic enzymes involved in the biogeochemical cycles of major elements in soils has been carried out. Agrostratozems of Medieval agricultural terraces in Dagestan mountains (Plaggic and Hortic Anthrosols) were chosen as objects of study. In all cases, the enzymatic activity of the studied soils decreased in all soil layers in the following sequence: alkaline phosphatase > phosphodiesterase > acid phosphatase > pyrophosphatase >= leucine aminopeptidase > arylsulfatase > chitinase > beta-glucosidase > xylanase > alpha-glucosidase > cellobiohydrolase. The enzymatic activity of the studied soils was primarily determined by the amount of microbial biomass (C-mic). Thus, the activity of enzymes of various groups depended on C-mic by 61-94%. Agricultural practices associated with ploughing, manuring, and irrigation induce the convergence in the activity of nitrogen cycle enzymes in soils of the mountain zone, which is associated with similar features of the nitrogen cycle in agrogenic soils, regardless of bioclimatic conditions. The addition of organic materials has led to an increase in the physiological efficiency of microbial communities and the rate of enzyme production, and high levels of biological activity can persist in soil for about 1000 years. Ploughing with the application of organic fertilizers in the past led to an increase in enzymatic activity expressed per unit of microbial biomass (specific activity), therefore, this indicator can be used as an indicator of agrogenic transformation of soils in the past.

TI  - Soil biocrusts affect metabolic response to hydration on dunes in west Queensland, Australia
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Soil biocrusts, formed from communities of microbes and their extracellular products are a common feature of dryland soil surfaces. Biocrust organisms are only intermittently metabolically active, but due to their ubiquity they make a significant contribution to the carbon cycle. Quantification of the controls and insights into the interlinked process of photosynthesis and respiration are essential to enhancing our understanding of the carbon cycle in the world's drylands. Yet, there have been relatively few field studies investigating controls on both biocrust photosynthesis and respiration. We undertook field-based experiments at two dune sites during the dry season in Diamantina National Park in Queensland, Australia to determine how biocrust hydration and illumination affect soil CO2 flux and photosynthesis. Static chambers and an infra-red gas analyser were used to quantify soil CO2 flux, and a fluorometer and a CFlmager were used to determine a range of photosynthetic parameters in the field and laboratory respectively. When dry, biocrust photosynthetic activity was not detected and soil CO2 flux was very low irrespective of biocrust cover. Hydration led to a large and immediate increase in CO2 flux, which was more pronounced in the presence of biocrusts and on the dune with thinner biocrusts. Hydration also initiated the onset of photosynthesis in some biocrusts, which was greatest under low light conditions and sustained with further hydration. There were only infrequent periods of net CO2 uptake to the soil, occurring when CO2 uptake due to photosynthetic activity was less than background soil CO2 flux. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging indicated biocrust spatial heterogeneity was evident at the cm scale where microtopography creates a myriad of environments for different crust organisms. Our findings demonstrate that biocrusts are highly spatially heterogenetic at both landscape and small scale, which suggests the maintenance of biocrust spatial diversity is likely to be key to imparting resilience to changing climate and disturbance. As well as reaffirming the importance of biocrusts for the carbon cycle in dryland dune soils the study demonstrates that biocrust respiration and photosynthesis respond differently to hydration and shading. This adds an unpredictability to the distribution of soil carbon stocks and the gaseous exchanges of CO2 between the surface and atmosphere. Future changes to precipitation and increased temperatures are likely to reduce soil moisture across much of the Australian interior and consequently biocrusts may experience a decline in biomass, structure, and function which could have significant repercussions beyond carbon stocks.

TI  - Cultivation of an obligate acidophilic ammonia oxidizer from a nitrifying acid soil
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Nitrification is a fundamental component of the global nitrogen cycle and leads to significant fertilizer loss and atmospheric and groundwater pollution. Nitrification rates in acidic soils (pH < 5.5), which comprise 30% of the world's soils, equal or exceed those of neutral soils. Paradoxically, autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria and archaea, which perform the first stage in nitrification, demonstrate little or no growth in suspended liquid culture below pH 6.5, at which ammonia availability is reduced by ionization. Here we report the discovery and cultivation of a chemolithotrophic, obligately acidophilic thaumarchaeal ammonia oxidizer, "Candidatus Nitrosotalea devanaterra," from an acidic agricultural soil. Phylogenetic analysis places the organism within a previously uncultivated thaumarchaeal lineage that has been observed in acidic soils. Growth of the organism is optimal in the pH range 4 to 5 and is restricted to the pH range 4 to 5.5, unlike all previously cultivated ammonia oxidizers. Growth of this organism and associated ammonia oxidation and autotrophy also occur during nitrification in soil at pH 4.5. The discovery of Nitrosotalea devanaterra provides a previously unsuspected explanation for high rates of nitrification in acidic soils, and confirms the vital role that thaumarchaea play in terrestrial nitrogen cycling. Growth at extremely low ammonia concentration (0.18 nM) also challenges accepted views on ammonia uptake and metabolism and indicates novel mechanisms for ammonia oxidation at low pH.

TI  - New insights in correlating greenhouse gas emissions and microbial carbon and nitrogen transformations in wetland sediments based on genomic and functional analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from constructed wetlands (CWs) lower the environmental and ecological benefits of CWs and thus have raised increasing environmental concern. To prevent GHGs emissions, it is important to assess and quantify the correlation of GHGs emission and microbial carbon and nitrogen transformations. In this study, two typical wetland substrate samples (mud sampled from Xiaomei River CW and sand sampled from Dongwen River CW) were used to build lab-scale vertical subsurface flow CW microcosms, labeled as XRCW and DRCW, respectively. The mean COD removal rate of the DRCW group (76.1%) was higher than that of XRCW group (60.6%). Both groups achieved a high extent of nitrogen nutrient removal, indicating a higher metabolic activity of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms in the system, especially in XRCW. The mean emission fluxes of N2O, CH4 and CO2 in the XRCW group were 52.7 mu g/m(2)-h, 1.6 mg/m(2)-h and 100.4 mg/m(2)-h, which were higher than that in the DRCW group (30.0 mu g/m(2)-h, 1.0 mg/m(2)-h and 28.0 mg/m(2)-h, respectively). The relation of GHG emissions to microbial carbon and nitrogen transformation was assessed by genomics and functional analysis. The release of GHGs by the XRCW group had a positive correlation with the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, while for the DRCW group a positive correlation was found with the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria. Nitrogen fixation by Cyanobacteria could be an approach to reduce GHG emissions. The release of CH4 and CO2 was positively correlated with glucose metabolism. N2O gas emission was affected by the species of denitrifiers. This study is of great importance to clarify the emissions of GHGs in vertical subsurface flow CWs, as it is relating to microbial carbon and nitrogen transformation. The connection is of great significance to control the emission of GHGs in wetlands.

TI  - Bacterial Communities and the Nitrogen Cycle in the Gypsum Soils of Cuatro Cienegas Basin, Coahuila: A Mars Analogue
T2  - ASTROBIOLOGY
AB  - The OMEGA/Mars Express hyperspectral imager identified gypsum at several sites on Mars in 2005. These minerals constitute a direct record of past aqueous activity and are important with regard to the search of extraterrestrial life. Gale Crater was chosen as Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity's landing site because it is rich in gypsum, as are some desert soils of the Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB) (Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico). The gypsum of the CCB, which is overlain by minimal carbonate deposits, was the product of magmatic activity that occurred under the Tethys Sea. To examine this Mars analogue, we retrieved gypsum-rich soil samples from two contrasting sites with different humidity in the CCB. To characterize the site, we obtained nutrient data and analyzed the genes related to the N cycle (nifH, nirS, and nirK) and the bacterial community composition by using 16S rRNA clone libraries. As expected, the soil content for almost all measured forms of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were higher at the more humid site than at the drier site. What was unexpected is the presence of a rich and divergent community at both sites, with higher taxonomic diversity at the humid site and almost no taxonomic overlap. Our results suggest that the gypsum-rich soils of the CCB host a unique microbial ecosystem that includes novel microbial assemblies.

TI  - Synergistic effects of antimony and arsenic contaminations on bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of Miscanthus sinensis: Insights for nitrification and carbon mineralization
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The impacts of metal(loids) on soil microbial communities are research focuses to understand nutrient cycling in heavy metal-contaminated environments. However, how antimony (Sb) and arsenic (As) contaminations synergistically affect microbially-driven ecological processes in the rhizosphere of plants is poorly understood. Here we examined the synergistic effects of Sb and As contaminations on bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of a pioneer plant (Miscanthus sinensis) by focusing on soil carbon and nitrogen cycle. High contamination (HC) soils showed significantly lower levels of soil enzymatic activities, carbon mineralization and nitrification potential than low contamination (LC) environments. Multivariate analysis indicated that Sb and As fractions, pH and available phosphorus (AP) were the main factors affecting the structure and assembly of microbial communities, while Sb and As contaminations reduced the microbial alpha-diversity and interspecific interactions. Random forest analysis showed that microbial keystone taxa provided better predictions for soil carbon mineralization and nitrification under Sb and As contaminations. Partial least squares path modeling indicated that Sb and As contaminations could reduce the carbon mineralization and nitrification by influencing the microbial biomass, alpha-diversity and soil enzyme activities. This study enhances our understanding of microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling affected by Sb and As contaminations.

TI  - Diversity distribution and characteristics of comammox in different ecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - The discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox), which can oxidize ammonia into nitrate, has recently changed the concept of traditional nitrification. However, comparative studies on the analysis of comammox microbial community in different ecosystems are still scarce. In this study, the distribution and diversity of the comammox microbial community in farmlands, riparian zones, and river sediments in summer and winter were investigated by high-throughput sequencing. And the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms was measured via their amoA genes of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The relationships between ammonia oxidation microorganisms and the environmental factors were further analyzed. The abundance of comammox clade A was one order of magnitude lower than that of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) but higher than that of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The abundance of comammox was higher in summer than in winter and higher in farmland soils (1.81 +/- 0.95 x 10(7) copies g(-1)) than in riparian zones and river sediments. Meanwhile, Candidatus Nitrospira nitrosa were the most widespread comammox in most samples (up to 86.31%), followed by Candidatus Nitrospira nitrificans, with a low abundance of Candidatus Nitrospira inopinata (lower than 0.61%). Furthermore, the abundance of comammox clade A had a significantly negative correlation with pH and NH4+ concentration (P < 0.05). The study revealed the potential advantages of comammox in farmlands and may be conducive to further research on comammox in microbial nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Biotic community shifts explain the contrasting responses of microbial and root respiration to experimental soil acidification
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil respiration is comprised primarily of root and microbial respiration, and accounts for nearly half of the total CO2 efflux from terrestrial ecosystems. Soil acidification resulting from acid deposition significantly affects soil respiration. Yet, the mechanisms that underlie the effects of acidification on soil respiration and its two components remain unclear. We collected data on sources of soil CO2 efflux (microbial and root respiration), above- and belowground biotic communities, and soil properties in a 4-year field experiment with seven levels of acid in a semi-arid Inner Mongolian grassland. Here, we show that soil acidification has contrasting effects on root and microbial respiration in a typical steppe grassland. Soil acidification increases root respiration mainly by an increase in root biomass and a shift to plant species with greater specific root respiration rates. The shift of plant community from perennial bunchgrasses to perennial rhizome grasses was in turn regulated by the decreases in soil base cations and N status. In contrast, soil acidification suppresses microbial respiration by reducing total microbial biomass and enzymatic activities, which appear to result from increases in soil H+ ions and decreases in soil base cations. Our results suggest that shifts in both plant and microbial communities dominate the responses of soil respiration and its components to soil acidification. These results also indicate that carbon cycling models concerned with future climate change should consider soil acidification as well as shifts in biotic communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Distribution of Genes and Microbial Taxa Related to Soil Phosphorus Cycling across Soil Depths in Subtropical Forests
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Although many studies have focused on the roles of soil microbes in phosphorus (P) cycling, little is known about the distribution of microbial P cycling genes across soil depths. In this study, metagenomic sequencing was adopted to examine the differences in the abundance of genes and microbial taxa associated with soil P cycling between organic and mineral soil in subtropical forests. The total relative abundance of inorganic P solubilizing genes was the highest, that of P starvation response regulating genes was second, and organic P mineralizing genes was the lowest. The soil organic carbon concentration, N:P ratio, and available P concentration were higher in the organic soil than the mineral soil, resulting in abundances of organic P mineralizing genes (appA and 3-phytase), and inorganic P cycling genes (ppa), whereas those of the inorganic P cycling genes (gcd and pqqC) and the P starvation response regulating gene (phoR) were higher in mineral soil. The four bacteria phyla that related to P cycling, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Candidatus_Eremiobacteraeota were higher in organic soil; conversely, the three bacteria phyla (Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi) and archaea taxa were more abundant in mineral soil. Therefore, we concluded that the distribution of genes and microbial taxa involved in soil P cycling differed among soil depths, providing a depth-resolved scale insight into the underlying mechanisms of P cycling by soil microorganisms in subtropical forests.

TI  - Effect of pesticides on nitrification activity and its interaction with chemical fertilizer and manure in long-term paddy soils
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Effect of pesticides on nitrification activity and its interaction among heavy metal concentrations (HMCs), antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes of long-term paddy soils is little known. The aim was to study the effect of pesticides on net nitrification rate (NR), potential nitrification rate (NP), HMCs, ARGs (sulI, sulII, tetO, and tetQ), and amoA (amoA-AOA, amoA-AOB, and amoA-NOB) genes in longterm treated paddy soils. NR and NP were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), whereas HMCs (Pb2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+) were a significantly increased (p < 0.05) in chemical fertilizer with pesticide treated paddy soils as compared with chemical fertilizer treated paddy soils. The scatter plot matrix indicated that total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and Fe were linearly correlated with NR and NP in long-term treated paddy soils. ARGs and amoA genes were significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in chemical fertilizer and manure with pesticide treated paddy soils. Overall, the result indicated the response of pesticide and their combination of manure with pesticide interaction present in long-term paddy soils, which will play a great role in the control uses of pesticides, manure, and chemical fertilizers in paddy soils and protect the nitrogen cycle as well as environment.

TI  - Habitat Specialization Along a Wetland Moisture Gradient Differs Between Ammonia-oxidizing and Denitrifying Microorganisms
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Gradients in abiotic parameters, such as soil moisture, can strongly influence microbial community structure and function. Denitrifying and ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms, in particular, have contrasting physiological responses to abiotic factors such as oxygen concentration and soil moisture. Identifying abiotic factors that govern the composition and activity of denitrifying and ammonia-oxidizing communities is critical for understanding the nitrogen cycle. The objectives of this study were to (i) examine denitrifier and archaeal ammonia oxidizer community composition and (ii) assess the taxa occurring within each functional group related to soil conditions along an environmental gradient. Soil was sampled across four transects at four locations along a dry to saturated environmental gradient at a restored wetland. Soil pH and soil organic matter content increased from dry to saturated plots. Composition of soil denitrifier and ammonia oxidizer functional groups was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) community analysis, and local soil factors were also characterized. Microbial community composition of denitrifiers and ammonia oxidizers differed along the moisture gradient (denitrifier: ANOSIM R = 0.739, P < 0.001; ammonia oxidizers: ANOSIM R = 0.760, P < 0.001). Individual denitrifier taxa were observed over a larger range of moisture levels than individual archaeal ammonia oxidizer taxa (Wilcoxon rank sum, W = 2413, P value = 0.0002). Together, our data suggest that variation in environmental tolerance of microbial taxa have potential to influence nitrogen cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Rhizosphere Soil Microbial Properties onTetraena mongolicain the Arid and Semi-Arid Regions, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Tetraena mongolicais a rare and endangered species unique to China. The total number and density ofTetraena mongolicashrubs in desertification areas have experienced a sharp decrease with increases in coal mining activities. However, available information on theT. mongolicarhizosphere soil quality and microbial properties is scarce. Here, we investigated the effect of coal mining on the soil bacterial community and its response to the soil environment in theT. mongolicaregion. The results showed that the closer to the coal mining area, the lower the vegetation coverage and species diversity. The electrical conductivity (EC) in the contaminated area increased, while the total nitrogen (TN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), and soil organic carbon (SOC) decreased. The activity of NAG, sucrose, beta-glucosidase, and alkaline phosphatase further decreased. In addition, the mining area could alter the soil's bacterial abundance and diversity. The organic pollutant degradation bacteria such asSphingomonas,Gemmatimonas,Nocardioides,andGaiellawere enriched in the soil, and the carbon-nitrogen cycle was changed. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Pearson's correlation coefficients showed that the change in the bacterial community structure was mainly caused by environmental factors such as water content (SWC) and EC. Taken together, these results suggested that open pit mining led to the salinization of the soil, reduction the soil nutrient content and enzyme activity, shifting the rhizosphere soil microbial community structure, and altering the carbon-nitrogen cycle, and the soil quality declined and the growth ofT. mongolicawas affected in the end. Therefore, the development of green coal mining technology is of great significance to protect the growth ofT. mongolica.

TI  - Determinants of the distribution of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities at the landscape scale
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Little information is available regarding the landscape-scale distribution of microbial communities and its environmental determinants. However, a landscape perspective is needed to understand the relative importance of local and regional factors and land management for the microbial communities and the ecosystem services they provide. In the most comprehensive analysis of spatial patterns of microbial communities to date, we investigated the distribution of functional microbial communities involved in N-cycling and of the total bacterial and crenarchaeal communities over 107 sites in Burgundy, a 31 500km(2) region of France, using a 16 x 16 km(2) sampling grid. At each sampling site, the abundance of total bacteria, crenarchaea, nitrate reducers, denitrifiers- and ammonia oxidizers were estimated by quantitative PCR and 42 soil physico-chemical properties were measured. The relative contributions of land use, spatial distance, climatic conditions, time, and soil physico-chemical properties to the spatial distribution of the different communities were analyzed by canonical variation partitioning. Our results indicate that 43-85% of the spatial variation in community abundances could be explained by the measured environmental parameters, with soil chemical properties (mostly pH) being the main driver. We found spatial autocorrelation up to 739km and used geostatistical modelling to generate predictive maps of the distribution of microbial communities at the landscape scale. The present study highlights the potential of a spatially explicit approach for microbial ecology to identify the overarching factors driving the spatial heterogeneity of microbial communities even at the landscape scale.

TI  - Urbanization-driven forest soil greenhouse gas emissions: Insights from the role of soil bacteria in carbon and nitrogen cycling using a metagenomic approach
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Increasing population densities and urban sprawl have induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the soil, and the soil microbiota of urban forests play a critical role in the production and consumption of GHGs, supporting green development. However, the function and potential mechanism of soil bacteria in GHG emissions from forests during urbanization processes need to be better understood. Here, we measured the fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in Cinnamomum camphora forest soils along an urbanization gradient. 16S amplicon and metagenomic sequencing approaches were employed to examine the structure and potential functions of the soil bacterial community involved in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. In this study, the CH 4 and CO 2 emissions from urban forest soils (sites U and G) were significantly greater than those from suburban soils (sites S and M). The N 2 O emissions in the urban center (site U) were 24.0 % (G), 13.8 % (S), and 13.5 % (M) greater than those at the other three sites. These results were related to the increasing bacterial alpha diversity, interactions, and C and N cycling gene abundances (especially those involved in denitrification) in urban forest soils. Additionally, the soil pH and metal contents (K, Ca, Mg) affected key bacterial populations (such as Methylomirabilota, Acidobacteriota, and Proteobacteria) and indicators ( napA , nosZ , nrfA , nifH ) involved in reducing N 2 O emissions. The soil heavy metal contents (Fe, Cr, Pb) were the main contributors to CH 4 emissions, possibly by affecting methanogens (Desulfobacterota) and methanotrophic bacteria (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Patescibacteria). Our study provides new insights into the benefits of conservation -minded urban planning and close -to -nature urban forest management and construction, which are conducive to mitigating GHG emissions and supporting urban sustainable development by mediating the core bacterial population.

TI  - Underground divergence and aboveground convergence of bacterial community compositions and nitrogen cycle-related functional groups in cultivated and wild Rheum tanguticum
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - Rhubarb is a plant extensively utilized globally for both dietary and medicinal purposes. As wild resources become increasingly scarce, there is a growing interest in artificially cultivated rhubarb. The plant bacteriome is crucial for enhancing plant growth and metabolism. However, the composition and functions of plant bacteriome communities, under the influence of natural and anthropogenic factors, remain largely unexplored in wild and cultivated rhubarb. Here, we conducted 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to focus on bacterial samples from bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, root, petiole, and leaf of wild and cultivated Rheum tanguticum at two sites with significant differences in altitude. Our findings indicated that, while host selection was the primary influencing factor, significant differences existed in the composition, function, community structure, and network complexity of the bacterial communities between cultivated and wild R. tanguticum. Cultivation activities altered the relative abundance of bacterial functional groups associated with the nitrogen cycle and significantly increased network complexity. However, these differences were mainly for root-associated bacteria but not for aboveground tissues. Differences in soil chemical properties resulting from fertilization may be the primary factor influencing the variation in bacterial communities between cultivated and wild soils. Structural equation model results also showed that changes in soil total nitrogen induced by fertilizer application directly affect the composition of rootassociated bacteria. In addition, we also observed differences in the main active components of wild and cultivated R. tanguticum roots at different altitudes, which were significantly affected by the taxonomic composition and functional characteristics of the root-associated bacteria. This initial insight not only establishes a foundation for further exploration of the intricate interactions among bacteria, host plants, and environmental factors but also fosters the advancement of the R. tanguticum industry, thereby promoting its high-quality and sustainable development.

TI  - Graphene oxide decreases the abundance of nitrogen cycling microbes and slows nitrogen transformation in soils
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Graphene oxide (GO) has been widely used in many applications due to its excellent properties. Given the extensive production and use of this nanomaterial, its release into the environment is inevitable. However, little is known about the effects of GO on microbial nitrogen transformation and the related processes after GO enters the soil environment. The present study showed that GO significantly reduced soil microbial biomass and caused a decline in microbial diversity after the soils were subjected to various GO concentrations (10, 100, and 1000 mg kg 1) for 4 months. Among them, the abundances of nitrogen transformation related bacteria such as Firmicutes, Nitrospirota, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetota, and Cyanobacteria were significantly decreased with GO incubation. Among the enzymes that are related to nitrogen transformation, nitrate reductase was the most sensitive even at low concentrations of GO, followed by ammonia monooxygenase and urease, which were reduced by 13-31%, 5-26%, and 9-19% respectively, than those of the control. We found that high concentrations of GO significantly increased the retention of soil urea by 32-59%, and the contents of ammonium and nitrate were 22-28% and 55-69% lower compared to those of the control, respectively. Moreover, the response of most of the indicators in the above process to multilayer GO was more significant than that to single layer GO. Overall, this study provides new insights into the comprehensive understanding of GO's impacts on the soil nitrogen cycle.

TI  - A Study on the Characteristics of Nitrification and Denitrification of Three Small Watersheds During the Wet and Dry Seasons with Various Sources of Pollution: A Case Study of the Jinjing Basin
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Nitrogen cycling in freshwater ecosystems is critical for maintaining water quality, and understanding the processes of nitrification and denitrification is essential for effective nitrogen management, particularly in areas with diverse pollution sources. This study investigated the nitrification and denitrification processes in three tributaries of the Jinjing River-Tuojia (agricultural), Jinjing (residential), and Guanjia (woodland)-during both the wet and dry seasons. The potential nitrification rates (PNRs) and potential denitrification rates (PDNRs) were measured across these sites. The highest rates were observed in Tuojia during the wet season, with the PNR reaching 39.7 mu g center dot kg(-1) h(-1) and the PDNR reaching 3.25 mg center dot kg(-1)center dot h(-1), while the rates were considerably lower in Jinjing and Guanjia. The ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) abundance was higher than the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) abundance at all sites, with Tuojia exhibiting the highest AOA abundance (5.9 x 10(7) copies center dot g(-1)) during the wet season. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) content was a key factor influencing denitrification, and the AOA abundance was significantly correlated with nitrification rates (r = 0.69; p < 0.05). These findings highlight the spatial and seasonal variability in nitrogen cycling and emphasize the importance of developing targeted nitrogen management strategies in regions with mixed land uses and pollution sources.

TI  - Community profiling and gene expression of fungal assimilatory nitrate reductases in agricultural soil
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Although fungi contribute significantly to the microbial biomass in terrestrial ecosystems, little is known about their contribution to biogeochemical nitrogen cycles. Agricultural soils usually contain comparably high amounts of inorganic nitrogen, mainly in the form of nitrate. Many studies focused on bacterial and archaeal turnover of nitrate by nitrification, denitrification and assimilation, whereas the fungal role remained largely neglected. To enable research on the fungal contribution to the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle tools for monitoring the presence and expression of fungal assimilatory nitrate reductase genes were developed. To the similar to 100 currently available fungal full-length gene sequences, another 109 partial sequences were added by amplification from individual culture isolates, representing all major orders occurring in agricultural soils. The extended database led to the discovery of new horizontal gene transfer events within the fungal kingdom. The newly developed PCR primers were used to study gene pools and gene expression of fungal nitrate reductases in agricultural soils. The availability of the extended database allowed affiliation of many sequences to known species, genera or families. Energy supply by a carbon source seems to be the major regulator of nitrate reductase gene expression for fungi in agricultural soils, which is in good agreement with the high energy demand of complete reduction of nitrate to ammonium.

TI  - Microbe-mediated attenuation of soil respiration in response to soil warming in a temperate oak forest
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Soil respiration (Rs) in response to climate warming received a wide concern due to its important role in terrestrial ecosystem carbon (C) cycling, but the warming-induced effects of soil microbes on soil respiration are still less understood, especially over time. Our study aims to understand the long-term warming induced effects of soil microbes on Rs. A field soil warming experiment using a completely randomized design was conducted in a naturally regenerated oak forest (Quercus aliena) in central China. Soil warming was executed by infrared heater throughout the period from 2011 to 2015. Our results showed that soil temperature was a main factor in regulating Rs in a temperate oak forest throughout the experiment, while soil water content determined Rs only when a naturally dry year occurred. The positive effect of soil warming on Rs that was observed (i.e., 37.5 to 42.0% in the first two years) gradually diminished in the following three years (i.e., 0.9 to 15.4%). Significant positive warming effects on the temperature sensitivity of Rs (Q(10)) only occurred in the second year. Continuous soil warming caused the decline in nitrogen (N) availability, with a significant increase in microbial biomass-specific enzyme activities for N-acquisition. The attenuation of microbial biomass increment and the decreased ratio of enzymatic C:N acquisition contributed to the diminished warming effect on Rs over time. Our study suggests that microbe-mediated attenuation of Rs, accompanied by the concomitant decline in soil N availability in response to warming, should be taken into consideration in global C cycle modeling.

TI  - Long-term farmyard manure application affects soil organic phosphorus cycling: A combined metagenomic and 33P/14C labelling study
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Maintaining an adequate phosphorus (P) supply for plants and microorganisms is central to agricultural production; however, the long-term effects of organic manure and inorganic fertilizer application on soil P cycling remain unclear. Organic P cycling in a sandy loam soil receiving medium and high rates of farmyard manure (FYM) with and without mineral fertilisers was studied in a long-term field experiment with C-14/P-33 isotope labelling and metagenomic shotgun sequencing. FYM application alone negatively affected soil total P and organic P (P-o) accumulation by enhancing crop offtake, enhancing P-o mineralisation and stimulating P loss from the topsoil by reducing its P sorption potential. The P mineralisation/immobilisation rates detected by the P-33 pool dilution method were significantly correlated with the abundance of microbial P cycling genes. Soil available C and N concentrations were related to gross P mineralisation/immobilisation rates and the abundance of P uptake/scavenging genes. Microbial genes related to P uptake and metabolism were more abundant than P scavenging genes, while P scavenging genes may work efficiently as both of them can sustain similar P mineralisation and immobilisation rates. The addition of FYM also promoted phosphatase activity reflecting the increased supply of P-o in these soils. Our study demonstrates that long-term FYM application alters soil P-o stocks and cycling, and that microbial functional gene abundance was coupled with P cycling rates.

TI  - Synergistic plant-fungal interactions under Phragmites australis- mangrove mixed growth regimes boost particulate organic carbon sequestration in estuarine wetlands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Estuarine wetlands, as globally critical carbon sink systems, rely heavily on the dynamics of soil particulate organic carbon (POC) to regulate carbon cycling. However, the mechanisms underlying how plant-fungal synergies under mixed plant communities drive POC accumulation remain unclear. This study focuses on the Min River Estuary wetlands, comparing the effects of mangrove wetland, Phragmites australis wetland, and mixed P. australis-mangrove wetland on soil POC and carbon components in particulate organic matter (POM). Mixed communities exhibit higher total biomass than monocultures. Fungal community analysis demonstrated that the relative abundances of Roussoella, Geosmithia, and Entorrhiza in mixed wetlands were significantly higher than in monoculture habitats (p < 0.05), with Geosmithia showing a significant positive correlation with POC (p < 0.05). Annual mean POC content in mixed wetlands surpassed mangrove and P. australis monocultures by 29.31 % and 28.69 %, respectively. RDA analysis revealed that aboveground biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), Papiliotrema, and Phaeomyces were the primary factors driving variations in POC. Collectively, mixed plant communities enhance POC accumulation by promoting diverse litter inputs and fungal-driven lignin decomposition-stabilization pathways. These findings elucidates the synergistic plant-fungal interactions driving POC accumulation in estuarine wetlands under mixed plant communities, providing a theoretical foundation for enhancing coastal wetland carbon sequestration and refining predictions of carbon cycling under global change.

TI  - A potential central role of Thaumarchaeota in N-Cycling in a semi-arid environment, Fort Stanton Cave, Snowy River passage, New Mexico, USA
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Low biomass and productivity of arid-land caves with limited availability of nitrogen (N) raises the question of how microbes acquire and cycle this essential element. Caves are ideal environments for investigating microbial functional capabilities, as they lack phototrophic activity and have near constant temperatures and high relative humidity. From the walls of Fort Stanton Cave (FSC), multicolored secondary mineral deposits of soil-like material low in fixed N, known as ferromanganese deposits (FMD), were collected. We hypothesized that within FMD samples we would find the presence of microbial N cycling genes and taxonomy related to N cycling microorganisms. Community DNA were sequenced using Illumina shotgun metagenomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results suggest a diverse N cycle encompassing several energetic pathways including nitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction and denitrification. N cycling genes associated with assimilatory nitrate reduction were also identified. Functional gene sequences and taxonomic findings suggest several bacterial and archaeal phyla potentially play a role in nitrification pathways in FSC and FMD. Thaumarchaeota, a deep-branching archaeal division, likely play an essential and possibly dominant role in the oxidation of ammonia. Our results provide genomic evidence for understanding how microbes are potentially able to acquire and cycle N in a low-nutrient subterranean environment.

TI  - 12-year N addition enhances soil organic carbon decomposition by mediating microbial community composition in temperate plantations
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil respiration is a crucial contributor to atmospheric CO2 flux and microbial communities play a vital role in carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the response of microbial community characteristics (such as diversity and composition) and their roles in regulating soil respiration under nitrogen (N) deposition remain unclear. Here, we conducted a 12-year N addition experiment (0, 2, 5, 10 g N m- 2 year- 1 ) in a temperate plantation to elucidate the mechanisms of autotrophic respiration and heterotrophic respiration in response to environmental and microbial factors. The results showed heterotrophic respiration increased significantly only under high-N addition (10 g N m- 2 year- 1 ), and autotrophic respiration decreased significantly under moderate- N (5 g N m- 2 year- 1 ) and high-N addition (10 g N m- 2 year- 1 ). The decrease in autotrophic respiration was primarily driven by environmental factors, such as soil pH and N availability, whereas the increase in heterotrophic respiration resulted from changes in the microbial community. Fungi Leotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Rhizophydiomycetes were identified as the key microbial predictors influencing heterotrophic respiration under N addition. Our work identified the role of soil microbial community composition in promoting soil organic matter decomposition under long-term N deposition. And we emphasized the importance of incorporating microbial community information into ecosystem models to improve predictions of climate-carbon cycle feedbacks.

TI  - Non-target effects of repeated chlorothalonil application on soil nitrogen cycling: The key functional gene study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The widespread and increasing application of chlorothalonil (CTN) raises concerns about its non-target impacts, but little information is available on the effect of CTN on the key functional genes related to soil nitrogen (N) cycling, especially in the case of repeated applications. In the present study, a microcosm incubation was conducted to determine CTN residues and the impacts on the abundances of key functional genes related to N cycling after repeated CTN applications. The results demonstrated that repeated CTN applications at the recommended application rate and five times the recommended rate led to the accumulation of UN residue in soil at concentrations of 5.59 and 78.79 mg kg(-1), respectively, by the end of incubation. Real time PCR (RT-PCR) revealed that repeated CTN applications had negative effects on the chiA and aprA gene abundances. There were significantly negative correlations between CTN residues and abundances of AOA and AOB genes. In addition, the abundances of key functional genes involved in soil denitrification were declined by repeated CTN applications with the sole exception of the nosZ gene. This study suggests that repeated CTN applications could lead to the accumulation of CTN residue and generate somewhat inconsistent and erratic effects on the abundances of key functional genes related to soil N cycling.

TI  - Plant growth drives soil nitrogen cycling and N-related microbial activity through changing root traits
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Relationships between plants and nitrogen-related microbes may vary with plant growth. We investigated these dynamic relationships over three months by analyzing plant functional traits (PFT), arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization, potential N mineralization (PNM), potential nitrification (PNA) and denitrification activities (PDA) in Dactylis glomerata cultures. D. glomerata recruited AMF during early growth, and thereafter maintained a constant root colonization intensity. This may have permitted high enough plant nutrient acquisition over the three months as to offset reduced soil inorganic N. PFT changed with plant age and declining soil fertility, resulting in higher allocation to root biomass and higher root C:N ratio. Additional to root AMF presence, PR' changes may have favored denitrification over mineralization through changes in soil properties, particularly increasing the quality of the labile carbon soil fraction. Other PFT changes, such as N uptake, modified the plants' ability to compete with bacterial groups involved in N cycling. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Responses of Bacterial Communities to Simulated Climate Changes in Alpine Meadow Soil of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The soil microbial community plays an important role in terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycling. However, microbial responses to climate warming or cooling remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to predict the consequences of future climate changes. To address this issue, it is critical to identify microbes sensitive to climate change and key driving factors shifting microbial communities. In this study, alpine soil transplant experiments were conducted downward or upward along an elevation gradient between 3,200 and 3,800 min the Qinghai-Tibet plateau to simulate climate warming or cooling. After a 2-year soil transplant experiment, soil bacterial communities were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The results showed that the transplanted soil bacterial communities became more similar to those in their destination sites and more different from those in their "home" sites. Warming led to increases in the relative abundances in Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria and decreases in Acidobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Deltaproteobacteria, while cooling had opposite effects on bacterial communities (symmetric response). Soil temperature and plant biomass contributed significantly to shaping the bacterial community structure. Overall, climate warming or cooling shifted the soil bacterial community structure mainly through species sorting, and such a shift might correlate to important biogeochemical processes such as greenhouse gas emissions. This study provides new insights into our understanding of soil bacterial community responses to climate warming and cooling.

TI  - Seasonal climate manipulations result in species-specific changes in leaf nutrient levels and isotopic composition in a sub-arctic bog
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - P>Climate change in cold biomes not only involves higher summer temperatures, but also warmer springs and more winter precipitation. So far, little is known about species responses to these seasonal components of climate change.
   We experimentally manipulated spring and summer temperatures and winter snow accumulation and temperatures independently in a peatland in sub-arctic Sweden. This yielded six climate scenarios and we studied the responses of the peat moss Sphagnum fuscum, the evergreen dwarf shrubs Empetrum hermaphroditum and Andromeda polifolia, the deciduous dwarf shrubs Betula nana and Vaccinium uliginosum, the grass Calamagrostis lapponica and the forb Rubus chamaemorus.
   We found substantial interspecific differences in leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables that reflect the response of tundra plants to climate change. S. fuscum had the lowest N and P concentrations, with increasing N and P concentrations (and decreasing C/N and C/P ratios) going from evergreen dwarf shrubs, to the grass, deciduous dwarf shrubs and the forb. Leaf N/P ratios varied between 10 and 14 which points to N-limited plant growth.
   The natural abundance of N-15 varied very strongly among species and growth forms. These differences corresponded with the presence and type of mycorrhizal association in the plant roots. Leaf carbon isotope discrimination also differed strongly among species and growth forms, but the absolute differences were relatively small (< 5 parts per thousand). The rank order was: forb and graminoid < moss and evergreen shrubs < deciduous shrubs.
   After 4 years, the effects of realistic climate change manipulations on leaf nutrient and carbon exchange variables were idiosyncratic with respect to species and generally small compared to the differences among species and growth forms. At the phenotypic level, spring warming or winter snow addition effects occurred as frequently as summer warming effects.
   This implies that the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have much more impact on plant-mediated nutrient and carbon cycling pathways and rates than climate-change induced phenotypic responses, irrespective of the seasonal timing of these climate changes.

TI  - Peaks of in situ N2O emissions are influenced by N2O-producing and reducing microbial communities across arable soils
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Agriculture is the main source of terrestrial N2O emissions, a potent greenhouse gas and the main cause of ozone depletion. The reduction of N2O into N-2 by microorganisms carrying the nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ) is the only known biological process eliminating this greenhouse gas. Recent studies showed that a previously unknown clade of N2O-reducers (nosZII) was related to the potential capacity of the soil to act as a N2O sink. However, little is known about how this group responds to different agricultural practices. Here, we investigated how N2O-producers and N2O-reducers were affected by agricultural practices across a range of cropping systems in order to evaluate the consequences for N2O emissions. The abundance of both ammonia-oxidizers and denitrifiers was quantified by real-time qPCR, and the diversity of nosZ clades was determined by 454 pyrosequencing. Denitrification and nitrification potential activities as well as in situ N2O emissions were also assessed. Overall, greatest differences in microbial activity, diversity, and abundance were observed between sites rather than between agricultural practices at each site. To better understand the contribution of abiotic and biotic factors to the in situ N2O emissions, we subdivided more than 59,000 field measurements into fractions from low to high rates. We found that the low N2O emission rates were mainly explained by variation in soil properties (up to 59%), while the high rates were explained by variation in abundance and diversity of microbial communities (up to 68%). Notably, the diversity of the nosZII clade but not of the nosZI clade was important to explain the variation of in situ N2O emissions. Altogether, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the response of N2O-reducing bacteria to agricultural practices and how it may ultimately affect N2O emissions.

TI  - Nonlinear response of ecosystem respiration to gradient warming in paddy field in Northeast China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Ecosystem respiration (ER) is greatly affected by global warming and responds nonlinearly to different warming levels. However, the mechanisms of the response of ER to gradient warming in paddy field remain obscure. Studying the effects and mechanisms of different warming levels on ER and its components in paddy field ecosystems will provide a theoretical basis for predicting future carbon budgets under climate change scenarios. In this study, 2-year gradient warming experiments with 5 warming treatments (+0 degrees C [control, CK], +0.3 degrees C [500 W warming, T1], +0.6 degrees C [1000 W warming, T2], +1.0.C [1500 W warming, T3], +2.3 degrees C [3000 W warming, T4]) were performed by using a free air temperature increasing (FATI) system in paddy field in Northeast China. ER and its two components, autotrophic respiration (AR) and heterotrophic respiration (HR), were measured to reveal the mechanisms of the response of ER to gradient warming. The results showed that ER, AR and HR increased significantly under warming treatments and exhibited nonlinear responses to different warming levels. The maximum increases in ER, AR and HR appeared in the 1500 W warming treatment. The nonlinear response of AR was primarily related to total plant biomass (TB), while the nonlinear response of HR was closely related to soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC). Furthermore, warming nonlinearly enhanced the AR/ER ratios but reduced the HR/ER ratios. The AR/ER ratios were much greater than the HR/ER ratios. ER was closely correlated with its two components, and its nonlinear response might mainly derive from that of AR. The results highlight that the nonlinear response patterns of ER and its components to warming should be taken into global carbon cycling models to predict future carbon-climate feedbacks.

TI  - Impacts of low-level liming on soil respiration and forage production in a fertilized upland grassland in Central France
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Liming is a common agricultural practice for improving acidic soils, but the addition of liming materials may also promote soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, with adverse effects for climate regulation. In grasslands, current understanding of liming impacts on greenhouse gas emissions is limited by a lack of field data on liming and soil respiration. Here we used a two-year field trial and in situ chamber measurements to evaluate the effects of repeated, low-level liming on soil CO2 emissions from an acidic managed grassland with high soil organic matter content. Soil pH, temperature and moisture were measured during the experiment, as well as microbial and plant biomass, in order to assess possible liming-induced changes to drivers of grassland carbon cycling. Soil CO2 emissions showed significant variation during the two-year study, driven primarily by fluctuations in soil temperature. Soil respiration rates were unaffected by liming treatment, despite significant lime-induced increases in soil pH. Liming was associated with a decrease in biomass produced per gram nitrogen, as well as a decrease in forage C:N in the second year and transient decreases in microbial C:N, but neither plant nor microbial biomass showed significant responses to liming addition. Collectively, our results suggest that positive effects of low-level liming on plants and soil are not offset by increases in soil CO2 emissions in situ, highlighting the potential for sustainable liming practices in fertilized grasslands.

TI  - Active microbial population dynamics and life strategies drive the enhanced carbon use efficiency in high-organic matter soils
T2  - MBIO
AB  - Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is a critical parameter that controls carbon storage in soil, but many uncertainties remain concerning adaptations of microbial communities to long-term fertilization that impact CUE. Based on H218O quantitative stable isotope probing coupled with metagenomic sequencing, we disentangled the roles of active microbial population dynamics and life strategies for CUE in soils after a long-term (35 years) mineral or organic fertilization. We found that the soils rich in organic matter supported high microbial CUE, indicating a more efficient microbial biomass formation and a greater carbon sequestration potential. Organic fertilizers supported active microbial communities characterized by high diversity and a relative increase in net growth rate, as well as an anabolic-biased carbon cycling, which likely explains the observed enhanced CUE. Overall, these results highlight the role of population dynamics and life strategies in understanding and predicting microbial CUE and sequestration in soil.IMPORTANCEMicrobial CUE is a major determinant of global soil organic carbon storage. Understanding the microbial processes underlying CUE can help to maintain soil sustainable productivity and mitigate climate change. Our findings indicated that active microbial communities, adapted to long-term organic fertilization, exhibited a relative increase in net growth rate and a preference for anabolic carbon cycling when compared to those subjected to chemical fertilization. These shifts in population dynamics and life strategies led the active microbes to allocate more carbon to biomass production rather than cellular respiration. Consequently, the more fertile soils may harbor a greater microbially mediated carbon sequestration potential. This finding is of great importance for manipulating microorganisms to increase soil C sequestration.

TI  - Microbial regulation of nitrous oxide emissions from chloropicrin-fumigated soil amended with biochar
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The microbial mechanism underpinning biochar's ability to reduce emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) is little understood. We combined high-throughput gene sequencing with a dual-label 15N-18O isotope to examine microbial mechanisms operative in biochar made from Crofton Weed (BC1) or pine wood pellets (BC2) and the N2O emissions from those biochar materials when present in chloropicrin (CP)fumigated soil. Both BC1 and BC2 reduced N2O total emissions by 62.9-71.9% and 48.8-52.0% in CP-fumigated soil, respectively. During the 7-day fumigation phase, however, both BC1 and BC2 increased N2O production by significantly promoting nirKS and norBC gene abundance, which indicated that the N2O emission pathway had switched from heterotrophic denitrification to nitrifier denitrification. During the post-fumigation phase, BC1 and BC2 significantly decreased N2O production as insufficient nitrogen was available to support rapid population increases of nitrifying or denitrifying bacteria. BC1 and BC2 significantly reduced CP's inhibition of nitrifying archaeal bacteria (AOA, AOB) and the denitrifying bacterial genes (nirS, nirK, nosZ), which promoted those bacterial populations in fumigated soil to similar levels observed in unfumigated soil. Our study provided insight on the impact of biochar and microbes on N2O emissions.

TI  - Warmer temperature accelerates methane emissions from the Zoige wetland on the Tibetan Plateau without changing methanogenic community composition
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Zoige wetland, locating on the Tibet Plateau, accounts for 6.2% of organic carbon storage in China. However, the fate of the organic carbon storage in the Zoige wetland remains poorly understood despite the Tibetan Plateau is very sensitive to global climate change. As methane is an important greenhouse gas and methanogenesis is the terminal step in the decomposition of organic matter, understanding how methane emissions from the Zoige wetland is fundamental to elucidate the carbon cycle in alpine wetlands responding to global warming. In this study, microcosms were performed to investigate the effects of temperature and vegetation on methane emissions and microbial processes in the Zoige wetland soil. A positive correlation was observed between temperature and methane emissions. However, temperature had no effect on the main methanogenic pathway-acetotrophic methanogenesis. Moreover, methanogenic community composition was not related to temperature, but was associated with vegetation, which was also involved in methane emissions. Taken together, these results indicate temperature increases methane emissions in alpine wetlands, while vegetation contributes significantly to methanogenic community composition and is associated with methane emissions. These findings suggest that in alpine wetlands temperature and vegetation act together to affect methane emissions, which furthers a global warming feedback loop.

TI  - Dam construction alters function and community composition of diazotrophs in riparian soils across an environmental gradient
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Dam construction significantly influences riparian ecological functions and environmental conditions in the reservoir region. Despite the importance of diazotrophic mediation of nitrogen cycling in riparian ecosystems, knowledge concerning the impacts of dam construction on diazotrophic function and community composition remains very limited. Here, riparian soils were collected from control sites and dam-affected sites located in six cascade dam-formed reservoirs on the Lancang River, China. Diazotrophic activity was assessed by measuring nitrogen fixation rate, while bacterial abundance and community composition were determined with the n(tH gene, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and MiSeq sequencing, respectively. The results indicate that the activity, abundance, and a-diversity of diazotrophs in the affected sites were significantly higher than those in the control sites. The diazotrophic community composition was differed between the control and affected sites, with the latter showing significantly lower community dissimilarity than the control. Both geographic distance and environmental heterogeneity varied in the diazotrophic community, while environmental heterogeneity was the primary factor controlling diazotrophic assemblage in riparian soils, especially at the affected sites. Moreover, co-occurrence network analyses revealed a much higher possible network connectivity at the affected sites than at the control sites. This study suggests distinct activity, abundance, distribution pattern, and network structure of the diazotrophic populations in riparian soils between dam-affected and control sites; thus, providing a novel insight into the potential ecological effects of dam construction on nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Effects of warming and precipitation change on soil nitrogen cycles: a meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Global warming and altered precipitation regimes may profoundly affect soil nitrogen (N) transformations. However, a comprehensive understanding of how soil N cycling responds to such climatic changes remains lacking, with few syntheses of field-based observations. Here, a meta-analysis was conducted using 755 paired data points from field observations worldwide to explore the effects of warming and altered precipitation on soil N transformation rates and to assess possible drivers of these effects. Warming positively affected the soil N mineralization and nitrification rates (+21.8% and +20.9%), but had no effect on the microbial immobilization rate. Similarly, increased precipitation accelerated soil N mineralization and nitrification (+10.2% and +9.4%), but did not alter microbial immobilization. In contrast, decreased precipitation did not affect any of the three N transformation rates. Moreover, warming effects on the N mineralization rate were mainly driven by the variations in soil moisture and soil total N content, while effects on the nitrification rate were regulated by changes in ammonia-oxidizing bacterial abundance. In addition, the effects of increased precipitation on the N mineralization rate were largely dependent on changes in soil moisture and experimental manipulation characteristics, while effects on the nitrification rate were shaped by mean annual precipitation, soil pH, ecosystem types and treatment duration. Overall, increased temperature and precipitation accelerated soil N cycling and increased soil N availability, but decreased precipitation did not. These findings may improve predictions of biogeochemical cycling under future climate change scenarios.

TI  - Periphytic biofilms function as a double-edged sword influencing nitrogen cycling in paddy fields
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - It remains unclear whether periphytic biofilms are beneficial to N cycling in paddy fields. Here, based on a national-scale field investigation covering 220 rice fields in China, the N accumulation potential of periphytic biofilms was found to decrease from 8.8 +/- 2.4 to 4.5 +/- 0.7 g/kg and 3.1 +/- 0.6 g/kg with increasing habitat latitude and longitude, respectively. The difference in abundant and rare subcommunities likely accounts for their geo-difference in N accumulation potential. The N cycling pathways involved in periphytic biofilms inferred that soil N and N-2 were two potential sources for N accumulation in periphytic biofilms. Meanwhile, some of the accumulated N may be lost via N-2, N2O, NO, or NH3 outputs. Superficially, periphytic biofilms are double-edged swords to N cycling by increasing soil N through biological N fixation but accelerating greenhouse gas emissions. Essentially, augmented periphytic biofilms increased change of TN (Delta TN) content in paddy soil from -231.9 to 31.9 mg/kg, indicating that periphytic biofilms overall benefit N content enhancement in paddy fields. This study highlights the contribution of periphytic biofilms to N cycling in rice fields, thus, drawing attention to their effect on rice production and environmental security.

TI  - Monitoring and assessment of vegetation covers of different biogeographical zones in Jordan using remote sensing and mathematical modelling
T2  - KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE
AB  - Plant systems act as reservoirs for storing carbon in biomass and soil. The main objective of this study is to assess the current and future changes in the carbon pools of ecosystems in Jordan's under-predicted climate impacts. The impacts of the land and the vegetation in the whole regional ecosystem on the carbon balance were assessed in the atmosphere-soil system using remote sensing techniques and mathematical modeling of the global carbon cycles. The assessment of Jordan's vegetation covers of different biogeographical zones of the country was carried out using satellite imagery of 30 m spatial resolution, from which the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was computed. The results of modelling have shown several numbers of patterns taking place in the ecosystems under the influence of & Scy;& Ocy;2 emissions and other anthropogenic impacts. Combining the NDVI values with the Spatial Model of the Global Carbon Cycles in the Atmosphere - Plants - Soil System (APS) it was possible to assess the dependence of the humus and biomass of vegetation on the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. NDVI analysis in the period 2000-2018 has shown an increase in the value of the index. The simulation results of the carbon in both humus and biomass for the period 2000-2060 have shown an exponentially increasing trend, which implies that the carbon sequestration capacity is improving with time.

TI  - Effects of simulated nitrogen deposition on microbial dynamics: Altered nitrogen fixation and ammonia oxidation in biological soil crusts
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Nitrogen-limited drylands are highly sensitive to environmental changes, with biological soil crusts playing a key role in biological nitrogen fixation. Ammonia oxidation, the rate-limiting step in nitrification, is essential for nitrogen retention in soils. Despite sustained high global nitrogen deposition, the impacts of varying nitrogen addition levels on nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation by crusts, and nitrogen cycling remain poorly understood. Crusts were sampled in April and October from plots in the Gurbantunggut Desert, where nitrogen had been applied for 13 years, to assess nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation rates, and the functional microbial community structure. Results indicated nitrogen addition reduced nitrogen fixation, with the highest nitrogen addition (3.0 g N m(2) yr(-1)) causing a similar to 60 % decline, suggesting a microbial shift towards reliance on added nitrogen. In contrast, low nitrogen addition (0.5 g N m(-2) yr(-1)) enhanced ammonia oxidation by 293 %, likely due to the alleviation of substrate limitations. However, higher nitrogen addition (N1.5, N3.0) led to a reduction in ammonia oxidation, with microorganisms such as Scytonema, Nitrososphaera, and Nitrosopumilus playing key roles in both processes. Notably, nitrogen fixation rates were generally lower during the dry season, while ammonia oxidation increased under N0 treatment. Nitrogen addition influenced the nitrogen fixation and ammonia oxidation capacities of the crusts, heightening the risk of nitrogen loss but diminishing the influence of prolonged drought. These findings underscore the need to consider nitrogen levels and seasonal dynamics when managing soil nitrogen processes to maintain the stability of dryland ecosystems and the nitrogen cycle, it is essential to reduce anthropogenic nitrogen deposition and mitigate the growing impacts of drought.

TI  - Effect of clay mineral on bacteria-virus interactions and the fate of microbial biomass carbon
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
AB  - Viruses are the major drivers of global geochemical cycles through lysis of host bacteria. The release of cellular organic matter (OM) to the environment via viral lysis short-circuits the carbon flow from bacteria to higher trophic levels, a process known as the "viral shunt". However, current understanding of bacteria-virus interactions is limited to the oceans. In sediments and soils, clay minerals are ubiquitous, but their roles in controlling viral lysis of host bacteria are virtually unknown. Here, we established a model experimental system using clay mineral montmorillonite, a common bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, and its lytic virus MSO-5 to investigate the impacts of clay mineral on bacteria-virus interactions, as well as the fate of the released OM. XRay Diffraction (XRD) and pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrum (PY-GC-MS) were used to detect OM intercalation into montmorillonite interlayer. The results showed that the presence of montmorillonite delayed lysis of bacterial host due to its spatial separation from virus and delayed release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) through adsorption. Low molecular weight compounds released from virus-induced cell lysis, mainly benzene derivatives, N-containing compounds, and ketones were preferentially intercalated into the interlayer space of montmorillonite. Our results demonstrate that clay minerals play an important role in bacteria-virus interactions in controlling release and preservation of microbially-derived organic matter, which is expected to have an increasingly important impact on carbon cycling as sediment inflow increases with global warming. This study advances our understanding of mineral-bacteria-virus interactions in the viral shunt, especially in clayrich environments such as soils and sediments.

TI  - Conventional and biodegradable agricultural microplastics: effects on soil properties and microbial functions across a European pedoclimatic gradient
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Agricultural plastics like mulching films may become a major source of microplastic (MP) soil contamination during their degradation and fragmentation. This study investigates the effects of agricultural MPs from conventional (linear low-density polyethylene, PE) and biodegradable (starch-blended polybutylene adipate coterephthalate, PBAT-BD) mulching films on soil physicochemical properties, aggregation, microbial diversity and functions, litter decomposition, and greenhouse gases emissions (GHG). For this purpose, MPs were mixed into soils at realistic MP concentrations of 0.005 % and 0.05 % (w/w) in 2022 on experimental plots in three EU countries representing different pedoclimatic conditions (Finland, Germany and Spain), followed by monitoring of the above-mentioned variables in the subsequent growing seasons 2022 and 2023. We found several significant MP-induced effects for soil properties, aggregation, microbial diversity, litter decomposition, and GHG, but the effect endpoints were less pronounced or varied considerably. Contrarily, microbial activity, contributing to soil functions such as nitrogen cycling, was consistently reduced by both conventional and biodegradable MPs. The reductions were more pronounced after the second season and for the higher MP treatment. As the higher MP concentration (i.e., 0.05 % w/w) is environmentally relevant in Europe, our findings emphasize the potential effects of environmentally relevant MP concentrations on soil health. Furthermore, the effects increased from north to south, probably modulated by varying pedoclimatic conditions, inducing reflection of a need for regionally tailored risk assessment to protect soil from plastic pollution.

TI  - Introduction of broadleaf species into monospecific Cunninghamia lanceolata plantations changed the soil Acidobacteria subgroups composition and nitrogen-cycling gene abundances
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims The introduction of broadleaf species into Cunninghamia lanceolata monoculture plantations could be a sustainable silvicultural practice for restoring soil fertility. We hypothesize that the addition of Phoebe bournei tree species will change soil physicochemical factors and microbial composition. Methods Soil physicochemical factors were determined. Bacterial composition and N-cycling functional genes were investigated by Illumina MiSeq sequencing and qPCR, respectively, and by using a co-occurrence network to explore the connections between the relative abundance of bacteria and soil physicochemical parameters. Results The introduction of P. bournei into C. lanceolata plantations increased available nutrients in the soil, decreased toxicity (Al3+ level), and slightly increased the soil bacterial diversity. The relative abundance of the total Acidobacteria community, as well as the most abundant subgroups (1, 2, and 3), were significantly higher in the monospecific stands. Different Acidobacteria subgroups behaved differently, i.e., Gp2 correlated negatively with soil nutrients and positively with the Al3+ level, while Gp17 showed the opposite behavior. Quantification of seven nitrogen cycling genes revealed that the nifH, nrfA, and nosZ abundances were higher in the mixed stands, while the nirK abundance was higher in the monospecific plantations. Co-occurrence network analyses showed a strong correlation between soil properties and the bacterial community. Conclusion P. bournei introduction into C. lanceolata plantations improved soil nutrients and affected the soil bacterial community. The higher nitrogen nifH and nrfA abundance in the mixed stands indicated a higher nitrogen fixation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction potential. Acidobacterial subgroups showed the opposite behavior to P. bournei introduction and could be used as indicators of soil nutrient changes.

TI  - The size and diversity of microbes determine carbon use efficiency in soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil is home to a multitude of microorganisms from all three domains of life. These organisms and their interactions are crucial in driving the cycling of soil carbon. One key indicator of this process is Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency (CUE), which shows how microbes influence soil carbon storage through their biomass production. Although CUE varies among different microorganisms, there have been few studies that directly examine how biotic factors influence CUE. One such factor could be body size, which can impact microbial growth rates and interactions in soil, thereby influencing CUE. Despite this, evidence demonstrating a direct causal connection between microbial biodiversity and CUE is still scarce. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted an experiment where we manipulated microbial body size and biodiversity through size-selective filtering. Our findings show that manipulating the structure of the microbial community can reduce CUE by approximately 65%. When we restricted the maximum body size of the microbial community, we observed a reduction in bacterial diversity and functional potential, which in turn lowered the community's CUE. Interestingly, when we included large body size micro-eukarya in the soil, it shifted the soil carbon cycling, increasing CUE by approximately 50% and the soil carbon to nitrogen ratio by about 25%. Our metrics of microbial diversity and community structure were able to explain 36%-50% of the variation in CUE. This highlights the importance of microbial traits, community structure and trophic interactions in mediating soil carbon cycling.
   Size-selective filtration was used to manipulate the maximum body size and diversity of microbial communities in an artificial soil experiment. A reduction in body size and biodiversity was found to impair microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) in soil. The results suggest that a smaller body size can impose metabolic constraints on bacteria and community CUE. Furthermore, the inclusion of relatively large micro-eukaryotes possibly increased CUE through trophic interactions. image

TI  - Inoculation with Stutzerimonas stutzeri strains decreases N2O emissions from vegetable soil by altering microbial community composition and diversity
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Inoculation with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains has promoted plant growth and decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils simultaneously. However, limited PGPR strains can mitigate N2O emissions from agricultural soils, and the microbial ecological mechanisms underlying N2O mitigation after inoculation are poorly understood. In greenhouse pot experiments, the effectseffects of inoculation with Stutzerimonas stutzeri NRCB010 and NRCB025 on tomato growth and N2O emissions were investigated in two vegetable agricultural soils with contrasting textures. Inoculation with NRCB010 and NRCB025 significantlysignificantly promoted tomato growth in both soils. Moreover, inoculation with NRCB010 decreased the N2O emissions from the fine-fine- and coarse-textured soils by 38.7% and 52.2%, respectively, and inoculation with NRCB025 decreased the N2O emissions from the coarse-textured soil by 76.6%. Inoculation with NRCB010 and NRCB025 decreased N2O emissions mainly by altering soil microbial community composition and the abundance of nitrogen-cycle functional genes. The N2O-mitigating effecteffect might be partially explained by a decrease in the (amoA+amoB)/(nosZI+ nosZII) and (nirS+nirK)/(nosZI+ nosZII) ratios, respectively. Soil pH and organic matter were key variables that explain the variation in abundance of N-cycle functional genes and subsequent N2O emission. Moreover, the N2O-mitigating effecteffect varied depending on soil textures and individual strain after inoculation. This study provides insights into developing biofertilizers with plant growth-promoting and N2O-mitigating effects.effects.
   IMPORTANCE Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have been applied to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils, but the microbial ecological mechanisms underlying N2O mitigation are poorly understood. That is why only limited PGPR strains can mitigate N2O emissions from agricultural soils. Therefore, it is of substantial significancesignificance to reveal soil ecological mechanisms of PGPR strains to achieve efficientefficient and reliable N2O-mitigating effecteffect after inoculation. Inoculation with Stutzerimonas stutzeri strains decreased N2O emissions from two soils with contrasting textures probably by altering soil microbial community composition and gene abundance involved in nitrificationnitrification and denitrification.denitrification. Our findings provide detailed insight into soil ecological mechanisms of PGPR strains to mitigate N2O emissions from vegetable agricultural soils.

TI  - Moso bamboo invasion into broadleaf forests is associated with greater abundance and activity of soil autotrophic bacteria
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Plant invasion can alter the soil microbial community and carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems; however, shifts in soil autotrophic bacterial communities and their driving environmental factors after plant invasion remain largely unknown. This study examined the relationship between Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubscens) invasion into broadleaf forests and autotrophic bacterial community composition-function at two field sites.
   The abundance and composition of autotrophic bacteria were characterized by real-time PCR, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism, and clone library based on the cbbL gene that encodes ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO).
   On average, the cbbL gene abundance was 89% higher and RubisCO enzyme activity 110% higher in the bamboo forest than in the broadleaf forests across the two field sites. The cbbL gene abundance was positively correlated with the RubisCO enzyme activity. The cbbL-containing communities were dominated by the order Rhizobiales, and their composition differed between the forest types and between the two sites, with the effect of site location being greater. Soil readily-oxidizable carbon concentration was a critical factor determining the site location effect on the diversity and activity of the cbbL-containing community.
   Greater abundance and activity of autotrophic bacteria were associated with bamboo invasion into broadleaf forests, implying that such invasions are expected to increase the CO2 fixation potential.

TI  - N-Cycling Microbiome Recruitment Differences Between Modern and Wild Zea mays
T2  - PHYTOBIOMES JOURNAL
AB  - Rewilding modern agricultural cultivars by reintroducing beneficial ancestral traits is a proposed approach to improve sustainability of modern agricultural systems. In this study, we compared recruitment of the rhizosphere microbiome among modern inbred maize and wild teosinte to assess whether potentially beneficial plant microbiome traits have been lost through maize domestication and modern breeding. To do this, we surveyed the bacterial and fungal communities along with nitrogen (N)-cycling functional groups in the rhizosphere of six modern domesticated maize genotypes and ancestral wild teosinte genotypes, while controlling for environmental conditions and starting soil inoculum. Using a combination of high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR, we found that the rhizosphere microbiomes of modern inbred and wild teosinte differed substantially in taxonomic composition, species richness, and abundance of N-cycling functional genes. Furthermore, the modern versus wild designation explained 27% of the variation in the prokaryotic microbiome, 62% of the variation in N-cycling gene richness, and 66% of N-cycling gene abundance. Surprisingly, we found that modern inbred genotypes hosted microbial communities with higher taxonomic and functional gene diversity within their microbiomes compared with ancestral genotypes. These results imply that modern maize and wild maize differ in their interaction with N-cycling microorganisms in the rhizosphere and that genetic variation exists within genus Zea to potentially "rewild" microbiome-associated traits (i.e., exudation, root phenotypes, and so on).

TI  - Covering green manure increases rice yields via improving nitrogen cycling between soil and crops in paddy fields
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Building soil organic nitrogen (SON) pools and improving N cycling between soil and crops can reconcile the global need for increased food production and environmental sustainability. We combined a global database and a 40-year field experiment in South China to demonstrate the beneficial effects of traditional green manure on rice yield and soil N cycling in paddy ecosystems. Covering green manure increased rice yield by up to 24 % in China and by 25 % globally mainly due to activated microbial activity, increased SON cycling, and available N content, compared with winter fallow treatment. Soil catabolic processes, such as enzyme activities were stimulated, thus increasing the rate of gross protein depolymerization by 2.3-3.8 times. This led to an increase in the amount of active SON fractions, e.g. of hydrolyzable amino acid N by 32 %-44 %. Concurrently, green manure increased the rate of gross amino acid consumption by microorganisms by 1.1-2.0 times. One part of the N ingested by microorganisms was used for growth to increase microbial biomass N and subsequently dead residues, and the other part increased soil NH4+-N content through catabolism. Ultimately, the utilization of soil original N by rice plants was improved by 31 %-42 % under covering green manure treatments. This study provides an agricultural management strategy to improve soil N supply for crops by increasing organic N cycling in paddy ecosystems and thus saving mineral N fertilizer.

TI  - Endosymbiotic bacteria within the nematode-trapping fungus Arthrobotrys musiformis and their potential roles in nitrogen cycling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Endosymbiotic bacteria (ESB) have important effects on their hosts, contributing to its growth, reproduction and biological functions. Although the effects of exogenous bacteria on the trap formation of nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) have been revealed, the effects of ESB on NTF remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the species diversity of ESB in the NTF Arthrobotrys musiformis using high-throughput sequencing and culture-dependent approaches, and compared bacterial profiles to assess the effects of strain source and culture media on A. musiformis. PICRUSt2 and FAPROTAX were used to predict bacterial function. Our study revealed that bacterial communities in A. musiformis displayed high diversity and heterogeneity, with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria as the dominant phyla. The ESB between A. musiformis groups isolated from different habitats and cultured in the same medium were more similar to each other than the other groups isolated from the same habitat but cultured in different media. Function analysis predicted a broad and diverse functional repertoire of ESB in A. musiformis, and unveiled that ESB have the potential to function in five modules of the nitrogen metabolism. We isolated nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying bacteria from the ESB and demonstrated their effects on trap formation of A. musiformis. Among seven bacteria that we tested, three bacterial species Bacillus licheniformis, Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were found to be efficient in inducing trap formation. In conclusion, this study revealed extensive ESB diversity within NTF and demonstrated that these bacteria likely play important roles in nitrogen cycling, including nematode trap formation.

TI  - Detritivores and exogenous nitrogen influence litter microbial communities in coastal salt marshes
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - Saprotrophic fungal communities and animal detritivores are known to regulate litter decomposition, yet their interaction has seldom been examined in coastal salt marshes. Such studies are important because salt marshes have some of the highest carbon storage rates of any ecosystem, and litter plays an important role in carbon cycling. Furthermore, it is currently unknown how species loss and nitrogen (N) pollution will impact the detritivore-fungi or detritivore-algae interactions that occur on litter. To test for changes in the microbial community of decaying Spartina alterniflora Loisel litter, we factorially altered the N concentrations of sediment surrounding the litter as well as the densities of Melampus bidentatus Say, 1822, an abundant but declining detritivorous snail that increases fungal abundance and litter decomposition rates. In each of 36 experimental plots, we analyzed the fungal and algal community composition of litter bundles (collected after 50 and 100 d, respectively) along with detritivore densities, plant traits, sediment and litter N, sediment chemistry, and microclimate. Notably, the densities of snails and isopods were associated with changes in the evenness and relative abundances of fungi in the litter, while amphipods influenced both fungal and algal communities. N additions further altered fungal community structure and increased the dominant saprotroph Natantispora retorquens at both timepoints. In sum, our novel field study revealed that N pollution and the loss of key detritivores, both of which are expected to increase in the future, will likely impact salt marsh fungi. Therefore, global change may impact the animal-microbial dynamics that influence above-ground carbon cycling.

TI  - Organic substrate availability and enzyme activity affect microbial-controlled carbon dynamics in areas disturbed by a mining dam failure
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - We investigated key ecophysiological traits of microbial communities across different disturbance levels for two upper horizon depths (A1: 0-3 cm and A2: 10-13 cm) in areas disturbed by Funda tilde o dam failure across Gualaxo do Norte river. We found that lower microbial growth (microbial biomass) and higher microbial-C losses (high qCO2) were linked to both decreases in organic substrate availability and enzyme activity suggesting important feedbacks on C dynamics in areas disturbed by Funda tilde o dam failure. Basal respiration was not affected by organic substrate availability but increased with enzyme activity at A2 suggesting an enzymatic compensation in response to a lower plant-derived input. Lower degradative activity of extracellular enzymes (expressed as GMean index) was linked to lower organic matter content in mine tailings. Our results suggest that changes in organic substrate availability reflect changes in the microbial-controlled C dynamics in mine tailings. Thus, the design of restorative strategies based on microbial traits has the potential to accelerate the rehabilitation in areas disturbed by Funda tilde o dam failure.

TI  - Abundance and Functional Importance of Complete Ammonia Oxidizers and Other Nitrifiers in a Riparian Ecosystem
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The discovery of complete ammonia oxidation (comammox) has altered our understanding of nitrification, which is the rate-limiting process in the global nitrogen cycle. However, understanding the ecological role of comammox or its contribution to nitrification in both natural and artificial ecosystems is still in its infancy. Here, we investigated the community distribution and function of comammox bacteria in riparian ecosystems and analyzed interactions between comammox and other nitrogen cycling microorganisms. The comammox bacterial abundance and rate were higher in summer than in winter and higher in nonrhizosphere soils than in the rhizosphere. Fringe soils in the riparian zone comprise a comammox hotspot, where the abundance (2.58 x 10(8) copies g(-1)) and rate (0.86 mg N kg(-1) d(-1)) of comammox were not only higher than at other sampling sites but also higher than those of other ammonia oxidation processes. The comammox rate correlated significantly positively with relative abundance of the comammox species Candidatus Nitrospira nitrificans but not with that of the species Candidatus Nitrospira nitrosa. Analysis of comammox interaction with other ammonia-oxidizing processes revealed ammonia-oxidizing archaea to dominate interface soils, comammox to dominate in fringe soils, and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) to dominate in interface sediments of the riparian zone. These results indicate that comammox may constitute an important and currently underestimated process of microbial nitrification in riparian zone ecosystems.

TI  - Forest conversion to conifers induces a regime shift in soil process domain affecting carbon stability
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - A substantial part of forests worldwide is located on acidic soils. Acidification processes are typically characterized by non-linear responses of soils to external drivers. Acid buffer ranges and thresholds in soils are widely acknowledged, yet these non-linearities are rarely incorporated into our understanding of soil carbon dynamics. Here, we studied the effect of conversion of broadleaved mixed forest to Norway spruce monocultures on different functional compartments of the belowground carbon cycle, i.e. litter layers, soil fauna and soil microorganisms, and examined how in turn they affect soil biochemical characteristics and ultimately, soil carbon stability. By studying this effect chain along a soil buffering gradient, we were able to evaluate the relative significance of forest management versus edaphic constraints on soil carbon processing. The effects of conversion are extensive and change trajectories are larger for forests that shifted from one buffering domain to another upon conversion. In the latter, conversion leads to a larger buildup of the litter layer, significantly stronger acidification, and a decrease in microbial functional diversity and earthworm biomass in the mineral soil, mirrored by a collapse of the base saturation. Although topsoil total carbon concentrations increased under spruce, this soil carbon is stored in less stable carbon pools compared to broadleaved forests. These are carbon pools where carbon is not occluded in aggregates or bound to soil minerals and therefore more vulnerable to environmental factors. Our findings show that changes in forest composition can, depending on the initial distance from a threshold in acid buffering, cascade through different compartments of the soil carbon cycle and eventually alter the way carbon is stored.

TI  - Enhanced understanding of soil methane processes through modeling microbial kinetics and taxonomy
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil methane (CH4) emissions significantly impact climate change. However, microbial controls of CH4 in global carbon cycle gain less attention than CO2, hindering the understanding of CH4 processes. Here, stemming from a baseline model (MENDmm1) with one microbial group, we developed a microbial-explicit CH4 model by representing six microbial groups following Michaelis-Menten kinetics (MENDmm6). We compared MENDmm6 with MENDfo6 (first-order kinetics) and MENDmm5 (excluding syntrophic acetate oxidation, SAO), alongside MENDmm1. Split-sample calibration and validation were conducted using high-temporal-resolution CO2 and CH4 effluxes from two soils (Oxisol and Mollisol) under five oxygen-fluctuation treatments. MENDmm6 (mean R2 = 0.66) improved CH4 modeling by 47 % over MENDmm1 (mean R2 = 0.45), with a 15 % improvement for CO2. MENDmm6-simulated methanogenic and methanotrophic biomass closely matched observed OTU abundances (r = 0.69-0.94), except for methanotrophs in the Oxisol (r = 0.13). Furthermore, including microbial processes without explicit microbial kinetics (MENDfo6) did not improve model performance over MENDmm1. Neglecting SAO in MENDmm5 failed to explain the observed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis dominance. Our results emphasize the significance of explicit microbial communities and kinetics in CH4 modeling. The proposed MENDmm6 model, leveraging molecular measurements of CH4-cycling microbes, will enhance predictions of management impacts on CH4 emissions, crucial for climate mitigation.

TI  - Geologic nitrogen and climate change in the geochemical budget of Karkevagge, Swedish Lapland
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB  - While nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth in the terrestrial environment and generally fixed by biological processes in soils, in Arctic and alpine environments N is a severely limited nutrient because of both climatic and soil constraints. It is widely believed that geologic nitrogen is such a small component of the nitrogen cycle that this source is generally not viewed as being a significant component. However, it has been estimated that in fact as much as 20% of the total nitrogen budget may be stored in geological materials and where N is severely limited such as in Arctic and alpine environments geologic N may in fact be a dominant source of N for biological processes. Nitrogen saturation may therefore have substantial impacts on geochemical cycles involving both soil and water chemistry.
   In order to determine the potential for the rocks and soils of Karkevagge to be significant sources of N samples of the principal rock units of the valley along with soil developed on a variety of rock types were sampled. Ammonia/ammonium contents were determined using ion chromatography. Ammonia/ammonium contents of the sampled rock materials display a wide range of abundances with marble containing a mean NH4 abundance of 4300 mg N kg, quartz schist 1600 mg N kg, biotite schist 4300 mg N kg, and garnet mica schist 4500 mg N kg. Soil ammonia/ammonium abundances were found to be 1600 mg N kg. N-pool abundances range from 2.5 kg m(3) for marble to 8.7 for garnet mica schist. Soil N-pools were found to be 3.0 kg m(3).
   The inorganic N present as ammonia/ammonium measured in bedrock represents substantial N-input into the geochemical budget. The N in bedrock originates from organically bound nitrogen associated with sediment or geothermal waters representing a mixture of sedimentary, mantle and meteoric sources. Nitrogen in the soil originates from the weathering of N-rich rocks, the presence of unweathered nitrate minerals or fluid inclusions released to the soil and ultimately to plants by assimilation by biota or nitrification. Geologic nitrogen in Karkevagge rocks and soils may represent a large and reactive pool with the potential for considerable impact on the geochemical system.
   To investigate the potential responses of nitrogen release, as well as other nutrients to increasing CO2 concentration scenarios, flow-through leaching experiments were conducted on crushed rock samples and soils from the study area. Leaching experiments revealed two to three fold increases in both N and K release with a tripling of carbon dioxide concentrations. Ammonium shows more rapid release than potassium which suggests substantial changes in nitrogen cycling with increasing CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Blending sludge alkaline hydrolysate and urea affects grape yield and quality by regulating soil bacterial communities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction Fertilization is vital for improving grape (Vitis vinifera L.) yield and quality. Unlike traditional nitrogen fertilizers, the mechanisms by which sludge alkaline hydrolysate (SAH), a novel fertilizer, influences grape quality and yield are still poorly understood.Methods In this study, six treatments were established: 20% SAH + 80% urea (M1), 40% SAH + 60% urea (M2), 60% SAH + 40% urea (M3), 80% SAH + 20% urea (M4), pure SAH (M5), and pure urea (M6). The effects of applying SAH and urea mixtures to grapes were evaluated, with focus on performance parameters, soil nutrients, and microbial communities.Results and discussion The results show that 60-80% SAH application significantly enhanced grape stem thickness, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic efficiency, fruit quality, and increased yield. Concurrently, it elevated soil nutrient contents, improved microbial community structure, and altered nitrogen cycle gene copy numbers. Molecular ecological network analyses indicated that Firmicutes, Acidobacteriota, Gemmatimonadota, and Ascomycota were key taxa. Bacterial-fungal cooperation was the dominant interaction, accounting for 65.98-94.61% of all observed microbial interactions, compared to antagonistic interactions. Mantel analysis showed that bacterial community and nitrogen cycle genes (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrogen fixation hydrogenase (nifH)) were important for grape yield and quality. These findings offer guidance for the effective use of SAH in grape production. Future studies should elucidate how SAH regulates fruit quality-related gene expression to uncover its mechanisms and enable its full-scale use in viticulture.

However, the extent to which the viral community varies has remained poorly understood and has the potential to contribute to variation in soil microbial communities. Here we cultivated replicates of two Zea mays genotypes, parviglumis and B73, in a greenhouse and harvested the rhizobiome (rhizoplane and rhizosphere) to identify the abundance of cells and viruses as well as rhizobiome microbial and viral community using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and genome resolved metagenomics. Our results demonstrated that viruses exceeded microbial abundance in the rhizobiome of parviglumis and B73 with a significant variation in both the microbial and viral community between the two genotypes. Of the viral contigs identified only 4.5% (n = 7) of total viral contigs were shared between the two genotypes, demonstrating that plants even at the level of genotype can significantly alter the surrounding soil viral community. An auxiliary metabolic gene associated with glycoside hydrolase (GH5) degradation was identified in one viral metagenome-assembled genome (vOTU) identified in the B73 rhizobiome infecting Propionibacteriaceae (Actinobacteriota) further demonstrating the viral contribution in metabolic potential for carbohydrate degradation and carbon cycling in the rhizosphere. This variation demonstrates the potential of plant genotype to contribute to microbial and viral heterogeneity in soil systems and harbors genes capable of contributing to carbon cycling in the rhizosphere.

TI  - Deterministic factors modulating assembly of groundwater microbial community in a nitrogen-contaminated and hydraulically-connected river-lake-floodplain ecosystem
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The river-lake-floodplain system (RLFS) undergoes intensive surface-groundwater mass and energy exchanges. Some freshwater lakes are groundwater flow-through systems, serving as sinks for nitrogen (N) entering the lake. Despite the threat of cross-nitrogen contamination, the assembly of the microbial communities in the RLFS was poorly understood. Herein, the distribution, co-occurrence, and assembly pattern of microbial community were investigated in a nitrogen-contaminated and hydraulically-connected RLFS. The results showed that nitrate was widely distributed with greater accumulation on the south than on the north side, and ammonia was accumulated in the groundwater discharge area (estuary and lakeshore). The heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria and aerobic denitrifying bacteria were distributed across the entire area. In estuary and lakeshore with low levels of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and high levels of total organic carbon (TOC) and ammonia, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) bacteria were enriched. The bacterial community had close cooperative relationships, and keystone taxa harbored nitrate reduction potentials. Combined with multivariable statistics and self-organizing map (SOM) results, ammonia, TOC, and ORP acted as drivers in the spatial evolution of the bacterial community, coincidence with the predominant deterministic processes and unique niche breadth for microbial assembly. This study provides novel insight into the traits and assembly of bacterial communities and potential nitrogen cycling capacities in RLFS groundwater.

TI  - Patterns in coarse root decomposition of woody plants: effects of climate, root quality, mycorrhizal associations and phylogeny
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Coarse roots represent a globally important belowground carbon pool, but the factors controlling coarse root decomposition rates remain poorly understood relative to other plant biomass components. We compiled the most comprehensive dataset of coarse root decomposition data including 148 observations from 60 woody species, and linked coarse root decomposition rates to plant traits, phylogeny and climate to address questions of the dominant controls on coarse root decomposition. We found that decomposition rates increased with mean annual temperature, root nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Coarse root decomposition was slower for ectomycorrhizal than arbuscular mycorrhizal associated species, and angiosperm species decomposed faster than gymnosperms. Coarse root decomposition rates and calcium concentrations showed a strong phylogenetic signal. Our findings suggest that categorical traits like mycorrhizal association and phylogenetic group, in conjunction with root quality and climate, collectively serve as the optimal predictors of coarse root decomposition rates. Our findings propose a paradigm of the dominant controls on coarse decomposition, with mycorrhizal association and phylogeny acting as critical roles on coarse root decomposition, necessitating their explicit consideration in Earth-system models and ultimately improving confidence in projected carbon cycle-climate feedbacks.

TI  - Diluted pyroligneous vinegar promoted Rhododendron growth by changing functional genes involved in N cycling in the rhizosphere
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Excessive chemical fertilization in protected horticulture has caused nutrient accumulation, reduction of soil biodiversity, and subsequently soil degradation. Pyroligneous vinegar is a byproduct of pyrolysis for biochar production. While there has been an increase in interest in using pyroligneous vinegar as an amendment to improve soil quality, a paucity of data exists of its effect on the growth of acidophilous plants such as azalea (Rhododendron). To address this, we investigated the changes in the growth of azalea and soil microbial abundance, specifically those involved in nitrogen cycling in the rhizosphere with amendment of conventional inorganic NPK fertilizer (NPK) and four dilutions of pyroligneous vinegar each with matched NPK content. The results showed that the treatments of pyroligneous vinegar increased plant biomass (51%-99%), root length (29%-81%) and surface area (63%-151%), and nitrogen use efficiency (83%-299%) compared to NPK alone. The pyroligneous vinegar treatments decreased soil pH and increased the contents of rhizosphere soil dissolved organic carbon and nitrate, and changed potential denitrification activity. Compared with NPK, pyroligneous vinegar increased archaeal and bacterial amoA genes (AOA and AOB) abundances (45% 79% and 39% 75%, respectively) in nitrification, but inhibited the denitrification gene abundances (i.e. nirS and nirK abundance up to 21% lower). Pyroligneous vinegar increased the ratio of nosZ/(nirS + nirK), suggesting an increased potential to lower nitrous oxide emissions. Correlation analysis indicated that nitrogen use efficiency correlated positively with AOA and AOB, but negatively with nirS and nirK abundance. Therefore, our study suggests that pyroligneous vinegar could improve the growth of acidophilous plants and increase their nitrogen use efficiency by changing nitrogen cycling related functional genes, and could be a potential soil amendment in protected horticulture.

TI  - Experimental warming effects on the microbial community of a temperate mountain forest soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil microbial communities mediate the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). The amount of carbon (C) that is respired leaves the soil as CO2 (soil respiration) and causes one of the greatest fluxes in the global carbon cycle. How soil microbial communities will respond to global warming, however, is not well understood. To elucidate the effect of warming on the microbial community we analyzed soil from the soil warming experiment Achenkirch, Austria. Soil of a mature spruce forest was warmed by 4 degrees C during snow-free seasons since 2004. Repeated soil sampling from control and warmed plots took place from 2008 until 2010. We monitored microbial biomass C and nitrogen (N). Microbial community composition was assessed by phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) and by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of ribosomal RNA genes. Microbial metabolic activity was estimated by soil respiration to biomass ratios and RNA to DNA ratios. Soil warming did not affect microbial biomass, nor did warming affect the abundances of most microbial groups. Warming significantly enhanced microbial metabolic activity in terms of soil respiration per amount of microbial biomass C. Microbial stress biomarkers were elevated in warmed plots. In summary, the 4 degrees C increase in soil temperature during the snow-free season had no influence on microbial community composition and biomass but strongly increased microbial metabolic activity and hence reduced carbon use efficiency.

TI  - PREFERENTIAL USE OF ORGANIC NITROGEN FOR GROWTH BY A NONMYCORRHIZAL ARCTIC SEDGE
T2  - NATURE
AB  - PLANT growth in arctic tundra is strongly nitrogen-limited despite large pools of soil organic nitrogen1-4. Here we report that field-collected roots of Eriophorum vaginatum, an arctic sedge, rapidly absorb free amino acids, accounting for at least 60% of the nitrogen absorbed by this species in the field. In solution culture, Eriophorum accumulates more nitrogen and biomass when supplied with amino acids than when grown on inorganic nitrogen, whereas Hordeum vulgare (a cereal adapted to mineral soils) grows least when nitrogen is supplied as amino acids. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of preferential absorption and use of organic nitrogen by a non-mycorrhizal vascular plant. The direct absorption of amino acids by Eriophorum short-circuits the bottle-neck in arctic nitrogen cycles imposd by temperature-limited mineralization.

TI  - Plant community composition and phenological stage drive soil carbon cycling along a tree-meadow ecotone
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that vegetation composition and phenology drive both rhizospheric and heterotrophic soil processes, as an alternative to experimental approaches to partition these soil respiration sources.
   We compared surface CO2 efflux, depth profiles of CO2 production, extractable SOC and MBC, and soil temperature and moisture along transects between contrasting vegetation types (deciduous riparian trees and adjacent meadow) over the snow-free growing seasons of 2005 and 2006.
   A dense flush of the nitrogen-fixing forb Melilotus officinalis dominated the meadow in 2005, corresponding with very high rates of CO2 efflux (56 % higher than under trees and 82 % higher than in the diverse meadow community present in 2006). In 2006, proximity to trees was associated with greater surface CO2 efflux and CO2 production to 50 cm depth. SOC was higher under trees than in the meadow (p < 0.0001). MBC was not consistently affected by position relative to trees, but seasonality of MBC was altered by trees as an interactive effect of transect position and sample date (p = 0.01).
   Community and phenology effects on soil carbon cycling demonstrate the interactions between plant traits and rhizospheric and heterotrophic soil respiration sources. This study highlights a unique case of a highly productive, nitrogen-fixing monoculture exhibiting vastly higher soil respiration rates than a diverse grass-forb community within a single, unmanaged site.

TI  - Leading nutrient foraging strategies shaping by root system characteristics along the elevations in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations
T2  - TREE PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - When it comes to root and mycorrhizal associations that define resource acquisition strategy, there is a need to identify the leading dimension across root physiology, morphology, architecture and whole plant biomass allocation to better predict the plant's responses to multiple environmental constraints. Here, we developed a new framework for understanding the variation in roots and symbiotic fungi by quantifying multiple-scale characteristics, ranging from anatomy to the whole plant. We chose the rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) grown at three elevations to test our framework and to identify the key dimensions for resource acquisition. Results showed that the quantities of absorptive roots and root system architecture, rather than single root traits, played the leading role in belowground resource acquisition. As the elevation increased from the low to high elevation, root length growth, productivity and root mass fraction (RMF) increased by 2.9-, 2.3- and 13.8-fold, respectively. The contribution of RMF to the changes in total root length was 3.6-fold that of specific root length (SRL). Root architecture exhibited higher plasticity than anatomy and morphology. Further, mycorrhizal colonization was highly sensitive to rising elevations with a non-monotonic pattern. By contrast, both leaf biomass and specific leaf area (traits) co-varied with increasing elevation. In summary, rubber trees changed root system architecture by allocating more biomass and lowering the reliance on mycorrhizal fungi rather than improving single root efficiency in adapting to high elevation. Our framework is instructive for traits-based ecology; accurate assessments of forest carbon cycling in response to resource gradient should account for the leading dimension of root system architecture.

TI  - Response of Nitrifier and Denitrifier Abundance to Salinity Gradients in Agricultural Soils at the Yellow River Estuary
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Salinization is considered a threat to agricultural soil and decreases crop yield worldwide. Nitrification and denitrification are the core processes of soil N-cycle. However, the response of nitrifiers and denitrifiers to salinity in agricultural soils remains ambiguous. The study aimed to explore the effect of salinity on nitrifiers and denitrifiers communities in agricultural soils along a naturally occurring salinity gradient. The effects of salinity on the abundance, composition, and interactions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in surface soils were investigated. The abundance of nitrifiers significantly decreased in response to the increase in salinity. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were more susceptible to salinity elevation than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Nitrospira and Nitrobacter showed a similar trend to the salinity gradient, but the relative abundance of Nitrobacter was increased in the saline soils. High salinity decreased the abundance of napA and nirK, but had no significant effect on other marker genes for denitrification. Besides electrical conductivity, total sulfur (TS)+available potassium (AK) and TN+TS+C/N+total phosphorus (TP)+AK significantly explained the variation in denitrifier and nitrifier communities. We also found that high salinity decreased the connections between different N functional genes. These results implied the alteration of the nitrogen cycling community by high salinity mainly through decreasing AOA, NOB, and some denitrifiers with nitrate or nitrite reduction potentials and weakening the connectivity between nitrogen cycling drivers.

TI  - Towards a microbial process-based understanding of the resilience of peatland ecosystem service provisioning - A research agenda
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Peatlands are wetland ecosystems with great significance as natural habitats and as major global carbon stores. They have been subject to widespread exploitation and degradation with resulting losses in characteristic biota and ecosystem functions such as climate regulation. More recently, large-scale programmes have been established to restore peatland ecosystems and the various services they provide to society. Despite significant progress in peatland science and restoration practice, we lack a process-based understanding of how soil microbiota influence peatland functioning and mediate the resilience and recovery of ecosystem services, to perturbations associated with land use and climate change.
   We argue that there is a need to: in the short-term, characterise peatland microbial communities across a range of spatial and temporal scales and develop an improved understanding of the links between peatland habitat, ecological functions and microbial processes; in the medium term, define what a successfully restored 'target' peatland microbiome looks like for key carbon cycle related ecosystem services and develop microbial-based monitoring tools for assessing restoration needs; and in the longer term, to use this knowledge to influence restoration practices and assess progress on the trajectory towards 'intact' peatland status.
   Rapid advances in genetic characterisation of the structure and functions of microbial communities offer the potential for transformative progress in these areas, but the scale and speed of methodological and conceptual advances in studying ecosystem functions is a challenge for peatland scientists. Advances in this area require multidisciplinary collaborations between peatland scientists, data scientists and microbiologists and ultimately, collaboration with the modelling community.
   Developing a process-based understanding of the resilience and recovery of peatlands to perturbations, such as climate extremes, fires, and drainage, will be key to meeting climate targets and delivering ecosystem services cost effectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Agricultural practices of perennial energy crops affect nitrogen cycling microbial communities
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Production of perennial bioenergy crops on farmland that is suboptimal for food crops may mitigate nitrous oxide emissions and reduce nutrient loss while producing bioenergy feedstocks. The ability of bioenergy crops to provide these multiple ecosystem services depends on interactions between the soil N cycle and the bioenergy production system, but our understanding of these interactions is limited. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of perennial energy crop management practices, including grass species (switchgrass, prairie cordgrass, Miscanthus x giganteus , and a grass mixture), harvest timing (at anthesis and after a killing frost), and N application rate (0, 56, and 112 kg N ha(-1)) on populations of N-cycling soil microorganisms. We quantified the abundances of genes encoding N cycling enzymes involved in ammonia oxidation (amoA), nitrite ammonification (nrfA), denitrification (nirK , nirS , norB , and nosZ), and N fixation (nifH). We found that N application significantly affected the abundance of N-cycling genes. The abundance of bacterial amoA (AOB) increased as N fertilization increased, thereby increasing the proportion of AOB compared to archaeal amoA (AOA). The nitrite reductase genes, nrfA and nirS , were more abundant in the plots with 56 kg N ha(-1 & nbsp;)applied; however, the nirK nitrite reductase did not differ across N applications. Overall, AOA, nrfA , and norB were correlated with each other as were AOB, nirK , and nosZ. Our data imply that management practices of perennial grasses, especially N application, could have significant impacts on functionally important soil microbial communities within the soil.

TI  - Cropping system modulates the effect of spring drought on ammonia-oxidizing communities
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The severity of drought is predicted to increase across Europe due to climate change. Droughts can substantially impact terrestrial nitrogen (N) cycling and the corresponding microbial communities. Here, we investigated how ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), archaea (AOA), and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) as well as inorganic N pools and N2O fluxes respond to simulated drought under different cropping systems. A rain-out shelter experiment was conducted as part of a long-term field experiment comparing cropping systems that differed mainly in fertilization strategy (organic, mineral, or mixed mineral and organic) and plant protection management (biodynamic versus conventional pesticide use). We found that the effect of drought varied depending on the specific ammonia-oxidizing (AO) groups and the type of cropping system. Drought had the greatest impact on the structure of the AOA community compared to the other AO groups. The abundance of ammonia oxidizers was also affected by drought, with comammox clade B exhibiting the highest sensitivity. Additionally, drought had, overall, a stronger impact on the AO community structure in the biodynamic cropping system than in the mixed and mineral-fertilized conventional systems. The responses of ammonia-oxidizing communities to drought were comparable between bulk soil and rhizosphere. We observed a significant increase in NH4+ and NO3- pools during the drought period, which then decreased after rewetting, indicating a strong resilience. We further found that drought altered the complex relationships between AO communities and mineral N pools, as well as N2O fluxes. These results highlight the importance of agricultural management practices in influencing the response of nitrogen cycling guilds and their processes to drought.

TI  - Disentangling the impact of biogas slurry topdressing as a replacement for chemical fertilizers on soil bacterial and fungal community composition, functional characteristics, and co-occurrence networks
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - The application of biogas slurry topdressing with drip irrigation systems can compensate for the limitation of traditional solid organic fertilizer, which can only be applied at the bottom. Based on this, we attempted to define the response of soil bacterial and fungal communities of maize during the tasseling and full maturity stages, by using a no-topdressing control and different ratios of biogas slurry nitrogen in place of chemical fertilizer topdressing. The application of biogas slurry resulted in the emergence of new bacterial phyla led by Synergistota. Compared with pure urea chemical topdressing, the pure biogas slurry topdressing treatment significantly enriched Firmicutes and Basidiomycota communities during the tasseling stage, in addition to affecting the separation of bacterial and fungal alpha-diversity indices between the tasseling and full maturity stages. Based on the prediction of community composition and function, the changes in bacterial and fungal communities caused by biogas slurry treatment stimulated the ability of microorganisms to decompose refractory organic components, which was conducive to turnover in the soil carbon cycle, and improved multi-element (such as sulfur) cycles; however it may also bring potential risks of heavy metal and pathogenic microbial contamination. Notably, the biogas slurry treatment reduced the correlation and aggregation of bacterial and fungal symbiotic networks, and had a dual effect on ecological randomness. These findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the alterations occurring in soil microbial communities when substituting chemical fertilizers treated with biogas slurry topdressing, and promote the efficient and sustainable utilization of biogas slurry resources.

TI  - Carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions (CH4 and N2O) in mangroves with different vegetation assemblies in the central coastal of Veracruz Mexico
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The aim of this study was to quantify carbon stocks and the emission of the greenhouse gases (N2O and CH4) in mangrove forests with different vegetation assemblies in coastal lagoons of Veracruz Mexico. The vegetation included: black mangrove BM, dominated by Avicennia germinans, white mangrove WM, dominated by Laguncularia. racemose, red mangrove RM, dominated by Rhizophora mangle and mixed mangrove MM, dominated by the three species. Soil C stocks ranged 187-671 Mg C ha(-1) without significant (p = 0.149) differences among the mangroves with different vegetation. Significantly (p = 0.049) higher tree biomass C stock was observed in RM (127 Mg ha(-1)) than in MM (24.23 Mg ha(-1)). Methane emissions in RM (0.58-6.03 mg m-2 min-1) were significantly higher (p b 0.05) than in MM. (0.0035-0.07 mg m(-2) min(-1)), in WM (-0.0026-0.029 mg m(-2) min(-1)) and in BM (0.0054-0.0097 mg m(-2) min(-1)),during rainy, windy and dry season.RM had the longest period of inundation, the highest soil carbon concentration, and the lowest salinity. CH4 emissions showed a significantly positive correlation with soils carbon concentration, water level and water pH and, negative correlation with water salinity and Cl-1 concentration in soil and water. Emissions of N2O (0.04-3.25 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) were not significantly different among the mangroves with different vegetation, but they showed seasonal variations, with higher emissions during windy and dry seasons. N2O emissions showed significantly positive correlations with soil nitrate concentration and soil temperature. Results of this research are useful for mangrove conservation and restoration strategies to maximize carbon storage and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Taxonomic and functional characterization of microbial communities in Technosols constructed for remediation of a contaminated industrial wasteland
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - The construction of Technosols is an emergent technology based on the assemblage of technogenic materials for ecological reclamation of polluted land and waste recycling. Although this technology is in expansion, knowledge about the microbial communities in Technosols is limited, despite their central role in ecosystem functioning. In this 2-year study, the diversity and the abundance of total and functional microbial communities were characterized in two types of Technosols constructed to reclaim contaminated sites.
   The structure of the microbial community was analyzed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis fingerprinting in both types of Technosols, and the taxonomic diversity was further assessed by 16S rRNA clone library sequencing. Real-time PCR was used to quantify the abundance of the total bacterial and crenarchaeal community and of the functional guilds involved in N-cycling.
   16S rRNA sequencing showed that Proteobacteria was the main phylum in the Technosols (50-80 %). The other significant phyla identified were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Choloroflexi, and Actinobacteria. Real-time PCR quantification of the abundance of ammonia oxidizers, nitrate reducing, and denitrifying microbial communities involved in nitrogen cycling revealed that bacterial ammonia oxidizers were more abundant than crenarchaeal ammonia oxidizers. A high spatial variability of the microbial community, which decreased with time, was also observed.
   At the phyla and class levels, the composition of the microbial community in constructed Technosols was similar to "natural" soils. Both the total bacteria and microbial guilds involved in N-cycling were abundant, but in contrast to most natural soils, bacteria and not crenarchaea were the numerically dominant ammonia oxidizers in both types of Technosols. The decrease with time of the variability in microbial community structure support early pedogenic evolution of recently constructed Technosols.

TI  - Short-term carbon cycling responses of a mature eucalypt woodland to gradual stepwise enrichment of atmospheric CO2 concentration
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Projections of future climate are highly sensitive to uncertainties regarding carbon (C) uptake and storage by terrestrial ecosystems. The Eucalyptus Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (EucFACE) experiment was established to study the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO(2)) on a native mature eucalypt woodland with low fertility soils in southeast Australia. In contrast to other FACE experiments, the concentration of CO2 at EucFACE was increased gradually in steps above ambient (+0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150ppm CO2 above ambient of similar to 400ppm), with each step lasting approximately 5weeks. This provided a unique opportunity to study the short-term (weeks to months) response of C cycle flux components to eCO(2) across a range of CO2 concentrations in an intact ecosystem. Soil CO2 efflux (i.e., soil respiration or R-soil) increased in response to initial enrichment (e.g., +30 and +60ppm CO2) but did not continue to increase as the CO2 enrichment was stepped up to higher concentrations. Light-saturated photosynthesis of canopy leaves (A(sat)) also showed similar stimulation by elevated CO2 at +60ppm as at +150ppm CO2. The lack of significant effects of eCO(2) on soil moisture, microbial biomass, or activity suggests that the increase in R-soil likely reflected increased root and rhizosphere respiration rather than increased microbial decomposition of soil organic matter. This rapid increase in R-soil suggests that under eCO(2,) additional photosynthate was produced, transported belowground, and respired. The consequences of this increased belowground activity and whether it is sustained through time in mature ecosystems under eCO(2) are a priority for future research.

TI  - Rock powder amendment mitigates microplastic induced destabilization of soil organic carbon by modulating molecular composition and microbial assembly
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Microplastic contamination poses a significant threat to soil organic carbon (SOC) stability, while enhanced weathering via rock powder application is a promising carbon sequestration technology that enhances SOC through mineral protection. To investigate rock powder's potential for mitigating microplastic-induced soil degradation, we conducted a controlled soil column experiment with four treatments: control (CK), microplastic (MP), rock powder (RP), and microplastic plus rock powder (MPRP). We analyzed SOC fractions, molecular composition, microbial diversity, carbon-cycling functional genes, and ecological assembly processes. MP treatment substantially decreased mineral-associated organic carbon and altered dissolved organic carbon composition toward higher aromaticity and molecular complexity. RP amendment effectively counteracted these adverse effects, with MPRP treatment showing the highest SOC content and enhanced thermodynamic stability. MP exposure significantly modified microbial community composition and reduced diversity, while RP maintained community structure closer to CK and enhanced carbon-cycling gene abundance. Ecological process analysis revealed that RP increased heterogeneous selection and and homogenizing dispersal processes compared to MP treatment. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that soil physicochemical properties influenced SOC indirectly through microbial communities and organic carbon molecular properties. These findings demonstrate that rock powder amendment effectively mitigates microplastic-induced soil degradation by enhancing SOC content and stability through modulating organic carbon molecular composition, microbial community structure, and ecological assembly processes. This provides a promising nature-based solution for addressing microplastic contamination in soils, though potential environmental and economic trade-offs require further evaluation.

TI  - Invasive perennial forb effects on gross soil nitrogen cycling and nitrous oxide fluxes depend on phenology
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Invasive plants can increase soil nitrogen (N) pools and accelerate soil N cycling rates, but their effect on gross N cycling and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions has rarely been studied. We hypothesized that perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium) invasion would increase rates of N cycling and gaseous N loss, thereby depleting ecosystem N and causing a negative feedback on invasion. We measured a suite of gross N cycling rates and net N2O fluxes in invaded and uninvaded areas of an annual grassland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta region of northern California. During the growing season, pepperweed-invaded soils had lower microbial biomass N, gross N mineralization, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and denitrification-derived net N2O fluxes (P < 0.02 for all). During pepperweed dormancy, gross N mineralization, DNRA, and denitrification-derived net N2O fluxes were stimulated in pepperweed-invaded plots, presumably by N-rich litter inputs and decreased competition between microbes and plants for N (P < 0.04 for all). Soil organic carbon and total N concentrations, which reflect pepperweed effects integrated over longer time scales, were lower in pepperweed-invaded soils (P P = 0.04, respectively). Overall, pepperweed invasion had a net negative effect on ecosystem N status, depleting soil total N to potentially cause a negative feedback to invasion in the long term.

TI  - Transformation of maize photosynthetic carbon in reconstructed soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction: The gully erosion control and land construction project was a major land improvement project implemented by human beings to increase the cultivated land area and improve the quality of cultivated land, and the implementation of the project had a great intervention and influence on the carbon cycle. Methods: The microcosm experiment was carried out to reveal carbon cycle process of maize photosynthetic carbon in reconstructed soils during gully reclamation using a(14)C continuous labeling technique. The experimental soil came from Nanniwan Town, Yan'an City. Results: The distribution ratios of photosynthetic carbon in plants, roots and reconstructed soils were 83.96%-85.19%, 9.47-10.55% and 5.49-5.62%, respectively. It was revealed that the renewal rates of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in reconstructed soils were 6.72%-14.64%, 1.70%-7.67% and 0.73%-1.99%, respectively. Discussion: The distribution and transformation of maize photosynthetic carbon had a greater impact on the changes in the DOC and MBC that SOC. It was found that the mineralization rate of maize photosynthetic carbon in reconstructed soils was higher than 0.6 mu g/g<middle dot>d after construction, but with the extension of cultivation time, it slowed down, the decreasing rate increased, and finally stabilized at about 0.15 mu g/g<middle dot>d.

TI  - Soil invertebrate fauna affect N2O emissions from soil
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soils contribute significantly to global warming. Mitigation of N2O emissions is severely hampered by a lack of understanding of its main controls. Fluxes can only partly be predicted from soil abiotic factors and microbial analyses - a possible role for soil fauna has until now largely been overlooked. We studied the effect of six groups of soil invertebrate fauna and tested the hypothesis that all of them increase N2O emissions, although to different extents. We conducted three microcosm experiments with sandy soil and hay residue. Faunal groups included in our experiments were as follows: fungal-feeding nematodes, mites, springtails, potworms, earthworms and isopods. In experiment I, involving all six faunal groups, N2O emissions declined with earthworms and potworms from 78.4 (control) to 37.0 (earthworms) or 53.5 (potworms) mg N2O-Nm(-2). In experiment II, with a higher soil-to-hay ratio and mites, springtails and potworms as faunal treatments, N2O emissions increased with potworms from 51.9 (control) to 123.5mg N2O-Nm(-2). Experiment III studied the effect of potworm density; we found that higher densities of potworms accelerated the peak of the N2O emissions by 5days (P<0.001), but the cumulative N2O emissions remained unaffected. We propose that increased soil aeration by the soil fauna reduced N2O emissions in experiment I, whereas in experiment II N2O emissions were driven by increased nitrogen and carbon availability. In experiment III, higher densities of potworms accelerated nitrogen and carbon availability and N2O emissions, but did not increase them. Overall, our data show that soil fauna can suppress, increase, delay or accelerate N2O emissions from soil and should therefore be an integral part of future N2O studies.

TI  - Effects of the herbicide hexazinone on nutrient cycling in a low-pH blueberry soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY
AB  - The herbicide hexazinone was applied as the commercial formulation Velpar(R) L at field-rate (FR) concentrations of FR (14.77 mug ai g(-1)), FR x 5 (73.85 mug ai g(-1)), FR x 10 (147.70 mug ai g(-1)), FR x 50 (738.50 mug ai g(-1)), and FRx100 (1477.00 mug ai g(-1)) to acidic soil, pH 4.12, taken from a lowbush blueberry field. Hexazinone was tested for inhibitory effects on various transformations of the nitrogen cycle and soil respiration. Nitrogen fixation was unaffected by hexazinone levels up to FRx100 following a 4-week incubation period. Ammonification was initially inhibited by all levels of hexazinone, but after 4 weeks, ammonification in all treatment systems was equal to or greater than the control. Nitrification was more sensitive to hexazinone; however, application at a field-rate level caused no inhibition. Inhibitory effects were noted above FR after a 2-month endpoint analysis and above FRx5 after a 6-month endpoint analysis. Hexazinone concentrations up to and including FRx100 stimulated denitrification. Soil respiration was also stimulated over a 3-week period when applied at a level up to 100 times the recommended field rate. In general, it was found that when applied at the recommended field application rate, hexazinone does not adversely affect the nitrogen cycle or soil respiration in acidic lowbush blueberry soils.

TI  - New insights into cadmium-modulated relationships of phosphorus-nitrogen functions under herbicide disturbance in cornfields
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Metallic micronutrients probably mediate the nutrient functions in soils with long-term herbicide application. However, will hazardous metal cadmium have a synergistic effect with herbicides, which amplifies the interference on soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling functions? This study conducted a nationwide investigation to characterize the accumulation patterns of two typical herbicides (atrazine and nicosulfuron), cadmium, and metal micronutrients (iron, manganese, copper, and zinc) in maize fields. It specifically elucidated the individual disruptive effects of herbicides, the interaction mechanisms between herbicides and metals (particularly cadmium), and the key pathways and drivers influencing soil nitrogen-phosphorus functional linkages. Results showed that nicosulfuron and atrazine residues were negatively correlated with nitrogen and phosphorus functional genes, while the cadmium content was positively correlated with these functional gene abundance. Additionally, cadmium acted antagonistically with atrazine in terms of nutrient cycling functions. This is further verified by the higher sensitivity values of functional genes in the north than those in the south. Moreover, the results of the structural equation model showed that the abundance of nirK and nirS genes was significantly correlated with the abundance of the phoC gene in maize fields and herbicides, cadmium, iron, and zinc affected the phoC gene by affecting the nirS and nirK genes. This study provides novel insights by demonstrating that soil cadmium, analogous to beneficial metal micronutrients, effectively alleviates herbicide-induced (especially atrazine) disruptions to the relationships between nitrogen and phosphorus cycling functions in maize fields.

TI  - Biodegradable microplastics increase fungi-mediated N2O emission by rapidly releasing dissolved organic matters
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Plastic pollution in paddy fields disrupts soil nitrogen biogeochemistry, prompting the introduction of biodegradable plastics like PBAT (poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)) as a potential mitigation strategy to plastic pollution reduction. However, the effects of nonbiodegradable and biodegradable microplastics on the nitrogen cycle remain unclear. To clarify this, we conducted an incubation experiment, N2O isotopocules, and molecular analysis to assess the impact of additives from PBAT and non-biodegradable (polyethylene, PE) microplastics. This study aimed to investigate their effects on N2O emission from bacterial, fungal, and chemical denitrification. The results showed that PE reduced N2O production potential from denitrification (DN2O) and bacterial denitrification (BDN2O), while PBAT (poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)) increased DN2O and fungal-derived N2O (FDN2O) but decreased BDN2O. PE inhibited N2O production via bacterial denitrification due to the toxicity of plastic additives such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). In contrast, PBAT enhanced N2O production via fungal pathways by facilitating the release of dissolved organic carbon. Bacterial denitrification accounted for 43-56% of total N2O production potential (DN2O) in PE treatments but only 28-50% in PBAT treatments. These findings highlight the short-term risks posed by biodegradable microplastics in elevating N2O emissions and reveal new dimensions of the influence of microplastics on greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural soils.

TI  - Comparison of the Total, Diazotrophic and Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacterial Communities Between Under Organic and Conventional Greenhouse Farming
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Organic greenhouse farming is an innovative system that may maintain a high yield and healthy agroecosystem. There have been no rigorous studies on the comparison of total and nitrogen-cycling bacterial community in vegetable soils between organic and conventional farming management at large scale. A survey of bacterial community and nitrogen cycles from soils under organic and conventional greenhouse farming was performed at 30 sites, covering seven soil types with 4 to 18 years of organic farming history. Communities of the total, diazotrophs and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria were studied with high-throughput sequencing of the 16SrRNA,nifHandamoAgenes, respectively. Organic greenhouse farming did not influence alpha diversities. Beta diversities among the total (26/30) and diazotrophic (17/19) bacteria differed between farming systems, but compositional differences in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria between the two farming systems were only detected at 6 sites. Despite the effects of farming system on most bacterial genera were varied across different sites, organic greenhouse farming persistently selected for a few genera, possibly for the biodegradation of organic carbon with high molecular weight (Hyphomicrobium, Rubinisphaera, Aciditerrimonas, Planifilum, Phaselicystis, andOhtaekwangia), but against putative ammonia oxidizing (Nitrosospira, Nitrosopumilus) and diazotrophic (Bradyrhizobium) bacterial genera, as determined by 16SrRNAanalysis. Diazotrophic bacteria affiliated withnifHcluster 1J were preferentially associated with organic greenhouse farming, in contrast toPaenibacillus borealis. In summary, this study provides insights into the complex effects of organic greenhouse farming on the total, diazotrophic and ammonia oxidizing bacterial communities across different environmental context.

TI  - Microbial Communities of Peaty Permafrost Tundra Soils along the Gradient of Environmental Conditions and Anthropogenic Disturbance in Pechora River Delta in the Eastern European Arctic
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - Microbial communities play crucial roles in the global carbon cycle, particularly in peatland and tundra ecosystems experiencing climate change. The latest IPCC assessments highlight the anthropogenic changes in the Arctic peatlands and their consequences due to global climate change. These disturbances could trigger permafrost degradation and intensification of the biogeochemical processes resulting in greenhouse gas formation. In this study, we describe the variation in diversity and composition of soil microbial communities from shallow peat tundra sites with different anthropogenic loads and applied restoration interventions in the landscape of remnant fragments of terraces in the Pechora River delta, the Russian Arctic, Nenets Autonomous Okrug. The molecular approaches, including quantitative real-time PCR and high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16S RNA and ITS, were applied to examine the bacterial and fungal communities in the soil samples. Anthropogenic disturbance leads to a significant decrease in the representation of Acidobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, while the proportion and diversity of Proteobacteria increase. Fungal communities in undisturbed sites may be characterized as monodominant, and anthropogenic impact increases the fungal diversity. Only the verrucomicrobial methanotrophs Methyloacifiphilaceae were found in the undisturbed sites, but proteobacterial methanotrophs Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, as well as different methylotrophs affiliated with Methylophilaceae, and Beijerinckiaceae (Methylorosula), were detected in disturbed sites.

TI  - Estimating microbial carbon use efficiency in soil: Isotope-based and enzyme-based methods measure fundamentally different aspects of microbial resource use
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - How carbon partitions between microbial biomass and CO2 (carbon use efficiency, CUE) is key in all soil carbon cycling models. Traditional methods to estimate CUE focus on the physiological partitioning of specific substrates, typically labeled with isotopes. However, an alternative approach (Sinsabaugh et al., 2016) is based on community-level resource capture using assays of extracellular enzymes; although this uses the same name (CUE), it measures something distinctly different from the isotopic methods. Rather, it assesses how microbes shift resource use in response to substrate stoichiometry.

TI  - Carbon isotopic composition of forest soil respiration in the decade following bark beetle and stem girdling disturbances in the Rocky Mountains
T2  - PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Bark beetle outbreaks are widespread in western North American forests, reducing primary productivity and transpiration, leading to forest mortality across large areas and altering ecosystem carbon cycling. Here the carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of soil respiration (delta(J)) was monitored in the decade after disturbance for forests affected naturally by mountain pine beetle infestation and artificially by stem girdling. The seasonal mean delta(J) changed along both chronosequences. We found (a) enrichment of delta(J) relative to controls (<1 parts per thousand) in near-surface soils in the first 2 years after disturbance; (b) depletion (1 parts per thousand or no change) during years 3-7; and (c) a second period of enrichment (1-2 parts per thousand) in years 8-10. Results were consistent with isotopic patterns associated with the gradual death and decomposition of rhizosphere organisms, ale roots, conifer needles and woody roots and debris over the course of a decade after mortality. Finally, delta(J) was progressively more C-13-depleted deeper in the soil than near the surface, while the bulk soil followed the well-established pattern of C-13-enrichment at depth. Overall, differences in delta(J) between (nodality classes (<1 parts per thousand) and soil depths (<3 parts per thousand) were smaller than variability within a class or depth over a season (up to 6 parts per thousand).

TI  - Priming of soil organic matter decomposition scales linearly with microbial biomass response to litter input in steppe vegetation
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Fresh plant litter inputs accelerate soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition through a ubiquitous mechanism called priming. Insufficient priming has been suggested as a stabilization mechanism of SOM at depth, as well as the long-term persistence of some highly degradable organic compounds in soils. Priming therefore plays a crucial, albeit unquantified and commonly neglected, role in the global carbon cycle. Because priming intensity is likely to be altered by global change-induced changes in net primary productivity, it casts substantial uncertainty to future projections of the climate-carbon cycle feedback. Using results from a large field litter manipulation experiment in Mongolian steppe, we here show that priming intensifies with increasing litter inputs, but at a decreasing efficiency: the stimulation per unit litter added declines with increasing litter inputs. This non-linear behavior originates from two antagonistic responses to fresh litter inputs: a stimulation of microbial activity versus a shift in microbial community composition (more fungi) associated to substrate shift from SOM to litter. Despite all complexity, however, the priming effect on SOM decomposition scaled linearly with the response of microbial biomass across the entire range of plant litter addition (60-480 g C m(-2)), suggesting that priming could be modeled effectively as a function of the response of microbial biomass to litter inputs. Incorporating the priming mechanism in Earth System models will improve their estimates of the SOM-climate feedback and appears to be best addressed by explicitly representing microbial biomass in the models.

TI  - Fate of carbon influenced by the in-situ growth of phototrophic biofilms at the soil-water interface of paddy soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Phototrophic biofilms (PBs) are commonly found in the sediment/soil-water interface of paddy soils and have a significant impact on carbon cycles. However, the specific carbon fate influenced by the in-situ growth of PBs in paddy soil remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of in situ PBs growth on methane and carbon dioxide emissions, as well as dissolved organic matter (DOM) transformation. Our findings demonstrated a negative correlation between PBs growth and methane and carbon dioxide emissions, while showing a positive correlation with DOM composition. The in-situ growth of PBs reduced methane emissions by approximately 79 % and carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 33 % in the daytime, and also slowed down the degradation rate of dissolved organic matter from over 30.4 % to <16 %. Microsensor measurements revealed that these changes were attributed to the increased concentration and penetration depth of oxygen, as well as variations in pH caused by the growth of in situ PBs. Co-occurrence analysis indicated a robust correlation between DOM transformation and the significantly suppressed methanogenesis by methanogens such as Methanosaeta, Methanomassiliicoccus and Methanosarcina, and also the notably enhanced methane oxidation by methanotrophs including Methylobacterium, Methyloversatilis and Methylomonas, in response to the growth of PBs. These findings shed light on the impact of in situ PBs on methane and carbon dioxide emissions and DOM transformation, providing new insights for understanding carbon cycling in paddy soils.

TI  - Biochar application significantly affects the N pool and microbial community structure in purple and paddy soils
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background. The increasing demand for food production has resulted in the use of large quantities of chemical fertilizers. This has created major environmental problems, such as increased ammonia volatilization, N2O emission, and nitrogen (N) leaching from agricultural soil. In particular, the utilization rate of N fertilizer is low in subtropical southern parts of China due to high rainfall. This causes not only large financial losses in agriculture, but also serious environmental pollution.
   Methods. In this study, 16S rDNA-based analysis and static-chamber gas chromatography were used to elucidate the effects of continuous straw biochar application on the N pool and bacteria environment in two typical soil types, purple and paddy soils, in southern China.
   Results. Straw biochar application (1) improved the soilNpool in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils; (2) significantly reduced the emission of N2O, with no difference in emission between 1 and 2 years of application; (3) increased the abundance of N-processing bacteria in the soil and altered the bacterial community structure; and (4) improved the tobacco yield and N use efficiency in paddy soil. These findings suggest that, in southern China, the application of straw biochar can promoteNtransformation in purple and paddy soils and reduce the emission of the greenhouse gas N2O.

TI  - Niche differentiation of anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in artificial and natural water-level fluctuation zones of the Three Gorges Reservoir area
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Aims The water-level fluctuation zone (WLFZ) serves as a critical ecotone for nitrogen cycling in reservoirs, but microbial differentiation between artificial and natural WLFZs remains unclear. This study aims to explore how WLFZ type (artificial vs. natural) and hydrological gradients influence the niche differentiation of anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) and denitrifying bacteria.Methods and results Using soil physicochemical analysis, qPCR, and high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the communities of anammox and denitrifying bacteria in artificial and natural WLFZs at four elevation levels (150-180 m) in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. The results revealed that artificial WLFZ had significantly greater abundance and diversity of anammox bacteria and nirS/nirK-type denitrifiers than natural WLFZ. The abundance of anammox increased with increasing water level. Moreover, the diversity and abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers were generally higher than those of nirK-type denitrifiers, indicating better adaptation of nirS-type denitrifiers to the WLFZ environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir area. Anammox and denitrifiers predominantly exhibited competitive ecological interactions driven by NO2- dynamics. In contrast, nirS/nirK-type denitrifiers were influenced by the C/N ratio and moisture content and could coexist in the WLFZ.Conclusions WLFZ type and water level jointly shape the structure and ecological relationships of nitrogen-transforming bacteria. Artificial WLFZ provides more favorable conditions for nitrogen cycling. These findings offer insights into microbial nitrogen dynamics and inform reservoir management strategies.

TI  - Seasonal changes in labile organic matter as a function of environmental factors in a relict permafrost region on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Labile organic matter plays an important role in permafrost carbon cycling, however, little is known about the effects of permafrost on labile organic matter dynamics. Here, we examined seasonal changes in the labile organic matter including light fraction carbon (LFC), water extractable organic carbon (WEOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) contents in a relict permafrost region on the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), China. We selected three different areas including permafrost, boundary, and seasonally frozen ground area. The results showed that seasonal changes in labile organic matter were not the result of soil heterogeneity. Among all three areas, depth strongly correlated with labile organic matter content. LFC was significantly associated with the soil organic carbon (SOC) content. The MBC contents, which were the lowest in permafrost area but highest in seasonally frozen ground area, were strongly affected by temperature. Multiple linear regression models showed that temperature was a significant predictor for labile organic matter in the permafrost area, but the effects of temperature were weaker in the boundary and seasonally frozen ground areas. Our results suggested that permafrost degradation could decrease production but increase decomposition rates of labile organic matter in permafrost regions, and this process should be taken into consideration in permafrost carbon cycle models.

TI  - Thinning alters nitrogen transformation processes in subtropical forest soil: Key roles of physicochemical properties
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Thinning-a widely used forest management practice-can significantly influence soil nitrogen (N) cycling processes in subtropical forests. However, the effects of different thinning intensities on nitrification, denitrification, and their relationships with soil properties and microbial communities remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a study in a subtropical forest in China and applied three thinning treatments, i.e., no thinning (0 %), intermediate thinning (10-15 %), and heavy thinning (20-25 %), and investigated the effects of thinning intensity on the potential nitrification rate (PNR), potential denitrification rate (PDR), and microbial communities. Moreover, we explored the relationships among soil physicochemical properties, microbial community structure, and nitrogen transformation rates under different thinning intensities. Our results showed that intermediate and heavy thinning significantly increased the PNR by 87 % and 61 % and decreased the PDR by 31 % and 50 % compared to that of the control, respectively. Although the bacterial community structure was markedly influenced by thinning, the fungal community structure remained stable. Importantly, changes in microbial community composition and diversity had minimal impacts on the nitrogen transformation processes, whereas soil physicochemical properties, such as pH, organic carbon content, and nitrogen forms, were identified as the primary drivers. These findings highlight the critical role of managing soil physicochemical properties to regulate nitrogen transformations in forest soils. Effective forest management should focus on precisely adjusting the thinning intensity to enhance the soil physicochemical conditions, thereby promoting more efficient nitrogen cycling and improving forest ecosystem health in subtropical regions.

TI  - Nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment alter the composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in salt marsh sediments
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Ammonia oxidation is a central process in the nitrogen cycle. Particularly in marine and estuarine environments, few experiments have been conducted to tease apart the factors influencing their abundance and composition. To investigate the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus availability on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), we conducted a nutrient enrichment experiment in a Maine salt marsh and sampled sediment communities in three seasons over 2 years. We assessed community composition using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of cloned fragments of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene. Almost all of the amoA sequences fell within the marine and estuarine-specific Nitrosospira-like clade. Applied separately, nitrogen and phosphorus significantly altered AOB composition; however, together the nutrients had an interactive effect, and composition did not change. In contrast, nutrient enrichment did not alter AOB abundance. Furthermore, the response of AOB composition to nutrient enrichment varied over time. We conclude that closely related taxa within the marine/estuarine-specific Nitrosospira-like clade vary in their preference for nutrient concentrations, and this preference may depend on other temporally variable abiotic factors. Finally, AOB composition was highly variable within and across years even in untreated plots. Further studies are needed to test how these different aspects of compositional variability in AOB communities influence nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Heterogeneity of soil CO2 efflux from local parks across an urban landscape
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - Context The soil-atmosphere carbon exchange is an important component of the carbon cycle; however, dynamics of CO2 fluxes from urban landscapes are particular complicated and poorly understood due their heterogeneity. Objectives The objectives of this study were to examine the total and temporal variation in CO2 flux from wooded and turfgrass areas of local parks in different part of town and identify the biophysical characteristics and landscape level factors that contribute to CO2 flux spatiotemporal variance in urban greenspaces. Methods We characterized the soil CO2 fluxes, temporal variation, and response to soil temperature from five parks under uniform management of a medium-sized town in southwestern Virginia, USA. We measured site scale characteristics (soil properties, tree cover) as well as the urbanicity of the surrounding land (land cover composition, population). Results Soil total nitrogen, soil temperature, and bulk density explained approximately 70% variation in the annual CO2 flux across the five parks. Diurnal, weekly, and seasonal CO2 fluxes were primarily related to changing soil temperature and differed between the turfgrass and wooded areas. Contrary to predictions that increased urbanicity around parks would increase soil temperature and CO2 fluxes, both CO2 and soil temperature of turfgrass were higher at parks located on town edges compared to parks in the center. Conclusions In sum, this study indicates that soil nitrogen and compaction, urbanicity, and the resulting site-scale structure of vegetation have a strong influence on temperature dependent biogeochemical processes like CO2 efflux.

TI  - The effects of roots and earthworms on aggregate size distribution and their associated carbon under contrasting soil types and soil moisture conditions
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Soil's potential as a carbon sink is uncertain due to biotic and abiotic interactions. Soil aggregates are important carriers of organic carbon (OC), and clarifying the response of aggregates and their associated OC to plant roots and earthworms can better understand the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. Herein, we determined the regulatory role of plant roots (Lolium perenne) and earthworms (Metaphire tschiliensis) in isolation and in combination on aggregate size distribution and their associated OC and readily oxidizable OC (ROOC) under contrasting soil types (Phaeozems and Anthrosols) and soil moisture conditions (constant wetting, CW; wetting-drying cycle repeated four times, 4WD) by a laboratory microcosm experiment. Results showed that earthworm presence significantly increased plant biomass by 30 % and 221 % in Phaeozems and Anthrosols, respectively (p < 0.05). For Phaeozems, plant alone (P) and plant and earthworm in combination (PE) had lower proportion of large aggregate (5-8 and 2-5 mm) than bare soil (CK) under 4WD condition (p < 0.05). For Anthrosols, the PE treatment decreased the proportion of 5-8 and 2-5 mm aggregate by 45 % and 25 %, respectively, under CW condition, and decreased the proportion of 5-8 mm aggregate by 37 % under 4WD condition (p < 0.05). Moreover, the proportion of 5-8 and 2-5 mm aggregate in P treatment was lower under CW condition (6.92 % and 22.13 %) but was higher under 4WD condition (11.49 % and 32.55 %) than those in CK (14.69 % and 29.91 %; 8.85 % and 20.56 %) (p < 0.05). Our results further indicated that the PE treatment had relatively higher OC and ROOC contents, especially for small aggregates in Anthrosols. The study indicates that plant roots and earthworms significantly influence aggregate turnover and the carbon cycle, with soil type and moisture playing a crucial role.

TI  - Soil dependence of biochar composts in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions: An overlooked biophysical mechanism
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Biochar-manure co-compost (BM) has garnered considerable attention as a promising soil amendment for improving nutrient retention and mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). However, its efficacy often varies largely from one soil to another. By comparing soil CO 2 and N 2 O effluxes, solution chemistry, enzyme activities, and the abundances of N -cycle genes between BM and manure compost (M) across three soils of different texture classes through microcosm incubations, we aimed to develop biophysical mechanics to untangle the soil-dependent efficacy of BM in mediating soil carbon and nitrogen transformation processes. Compared to M addition, BM addition significantly reduced soil CO 2 and N 2 O emissions, but its effectiveness was soil texture-dependent, being strongest for CO 2 and N 2 O in fine-textured clay loam and coarse-textured sand, respectively. Such soil texture-dependent effects of BM versus M were also observed in soil enzyme activities and gene copy numbers of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and denitrifiers. Our datasets suggest that BM interacted strongly with soil texture to modulate the pore scale-based diffusion of oxygen, thereby creating divergence in the aeration status among soils. Sequentially, soil phenol oxidase activity was greater in BM than in M under more aerobic conditions but no difference between BM and M in oxygen-limited soils. The balance between oxygen depletion due to microbial respiration of organic amendments and oxygen diffusion through soil/biochar pores also shaped the activities of nitrifying and denitrifying prokaryotes differently between coarse- and finetextured soils. This logic model well-explained the magnitude of change in soil-dependent CO 2 and N 2 O emissions from organic amendments. The knowledge gained in this work will likely have profound practical ramifications for optimizing BM efficacy in mitigating the GHGs emission.

TI  - Source, contribution and microbial N-cycle of N-compounds in China fresh snow
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - The importance and contribution of nitrogen compounds and the related microbial nitrogen cycling processes in fresh snow are not well understood under the current research background. We collected fresh snow samples from 21 cities that 80% are from China during 2016 and 2017. Principal component analysis showed that SO42- were in the first principal component, and N-compounds were the second. Furthermore, the main pollutant ions SO42- and NO3- were from anthropogenic sources, and SO42- contributed (61%) more to the pollution load than NO3- (29%), which were confirmed through a series of precipitation mechanism analysis. We selected five N-cycle processes (consist of oxidation and reduction processes) for molecular biology experiments, including Ammonia-oxidation process, Nitrite-oxidation process, Denitrification process, Anaerobic-ammoxidation process (Anammox) and Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium process (DNRA). Except ammonia-oxidizing archaeal (AOA) and bacterial (AOB) amoA genes (above 10(7) copies g(-1)), molecular assays of key functional genes in various nitrogen conversion processes showed a belowed detection limit number, and AOB abundance was always higher than AOA. The determination of the microbial transformation rate using the N-15-isotope tracer technique showed that the potential rate of five N-conversion processes was very low, which is basically consistent with the results from molecular biology studies. Taken together, our results illustrated that microbial nitrogen cycle processes are not the primary biological processes causing the pollution in China fresh snow.

TI  - Bacterial response to soil property changes caused by wood ash from wildfire in forest soils around mining areas: Relevance of bacterial community composition, carbon and nitrogen cycling
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The different physical-chemical properties of the black ash (200?500 ?C) and white ash (>510 ?C) generated by wildfire may result in varied impacts on soil biological and abiotic indicators. Many studies have highlighted the environmental impacts of wood ash application due to its complex mixture of beneficial and detrimental compounds. However, few studies have compared the effect of black ash and white ash on soil, especially for the heavy metal polluted soil. In this study, we used the comparative analysis of parallel microcosm experiments to study the impacts of white ash and black ash on bioavailable heavy metals and metabolic potentials of microbial community. The results indicated that both white ash and black ash increased the concentration of soil bioavailable As and Cr, while the increasing trend of bioavailable As could be limited by Ca in the treatment of white ash. The addition of black ash could enhance the abundance of genes related to the Calvin cycle (CBB). Different kinds of wood ash inputs into soils could cause the differences in the microbial taxa for carbon fixation, as indicated by the dominance of different taxa for carbon fixation in white ash versus black ash treatments. Additionally, both white ash and black ash impaired dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), nitrate assimilation and nitrification, while white ash enhanced denitrification.

TI  - Vertical distribution of nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane-oxidising bacteria in natural freshwater wetland soils
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) is a recently discovered process that is catalysed by "Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera". In the present study, the vertical distribution (0-10, 20-30, 50-60 and 90-100 cm) of M. oxyfera-like bacteria was investigated in Xiazhuhu wetland, the largest natural wetland on the southern Yangtze River (China). Phylogenetic analyses showed that group A of M. oxyfera-like bacteria and pmoA genes occurred primarily at depths of 50-60 and 90-100 cm. Quantitative PCR further confirmed the presence of M. oxyfera-like bacteria in soil cores from different depths, with the highest abundance of 5.1 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry soil at depth of 50-60 cm. Stable isotope experiments demonstrated that the n-damo process occurred primarily at depths of 50-60 and 90-100 cm, with the potential rates ranging from 0.2 to 14.5 nmol CO2 g(-1) dry soil d(-1). It was estimated that the methane flux may increase by approximately 2.7-4.3 % in the examined wetland in the absence of n-damo. This study shows that the deep wetland soils (50-60 and 90-100 cm) are the preferred habitats for M. oxyfera-like bacteria. The study also highlights the potential importance of these bacteria in the methane and nitrogen cycles in deep wetland soils.

TI  - Vegetation types shape the soil micro-food web compositions and soil multifunctionality in Loess Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction Vegetation degradation and soil erosion are severe problems in the Loess hilly region, rendering it one of the most ecologically vulnerable areas in China and globally. Vegetation restoration has been recognized as an effective approach to amending the fragile ecological environment and restoring degraded ecosystems.Methods The effects of different vegetation types: Caragana korshinskii, Prunus armeniaca L., Pinus tabuliformis Carri & egrave;re, Medicago sativa L., and the control vegetation Stipa bungeana on soil micro-food webs and soil multifunctionality, as well as their response mechanisms to soil environmental drivers, were investigated using High-throughput sequencing technology.Results C. korshinskii significantly enhanced soil physicochemical properties and soil enzyme activities by facilitating the stability of the soil micro-food web structure driven by soil bacteria and fungi and increasing the soil multifunctionality in contrast to S. bungeana. Prunus armeniaca also improved soil multifunctionality by promoting soil organic carbon and alkaline phosphatase activity. However, the stability of the soil micro-food web structure and soil multifunctionality were suboptimal in P. tabuliformis and M. sativa. Soil pH, along with carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling nutrients and enzymes, profoundly influences the structure of the soil micro-food web and soil multifunctionality; among these factors, those related to the carbon and phosphorus cycles are identified as key influencing factors.Discussion Therefore, a vegetation restoration strategy prioritizing C. korshinskii as the dominant vegetation type, supplemented by P. armeniaca, significantly impacts restoring soil multifunctionality and stabilizing the soil micro-food web in Loess hill regions and comparable ecological areas.

TI  - Distinct Influence of Conventional and Biodegradable Microplastics on Soil Microorganisms and Nitrogen Cycling: Emphasizing the Effect of Biodegradable Polylactic Acid
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Biodegradable plastics are a feasible option to reduce plastic pollution, but the environmental effects of their release of microplastics (MPs) into the soil are still unclear. In this study, three typical types of MPs: polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA), with two particle sizes, were selected to systematically investigate the effects of short-term (one month) exposure to MPs on soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities, and bacterial community structure and functions. The results showed that MPs exposure apparently increased the total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen contents (TN) by 27.08-48.58% and 4.5-20.9%, respectively, while decreasing the ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) contents by 56.5-68.8% and 3.2-24%, respectively, but had no significant effect on pH and total phosphorus (TP) content. Small particle size (50 mu m) MPs and PLA-MP had greater effects on soil enzyme activity. 50 mu m PLA significantly decreased soil bacterial diversity (decreased by 9%, P < 0.05) and caused greater changes in bacterial community compositions and functions than other MPs. Nocardioides and Bacillus were proposed as MPs-degraders due to they were specifically enriched by MPs. Short-term exposure to MPs inhibited the nitrification process and organic degradation and synthesis processes, but enhanced the denitrification and nitrogen fixation processes. Our study highlighted the effect of smaller particle sizes of biodegradable PLA-MP on soil microbial community structure and function.

TI  - Land use intensity constrains the positive relationship between soil microbial diversity and multifunctionality
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims The positive soil biodiversity and multifunctionality relationship has been widely recognized, however in agricultural ecosystems, this relationship is context dependent and could be altered by land use intensity (LUI). Understanding how LUI affects soil microbial community and multifunctionality (SMF) is instructive for optimizing external inputs and managements. Methods We sampled soils from three cropping systems (cotton, wheat-maize and vegetable) with different LUI, sequenced both bacterial and fungal communities, and quantified the multifunctionality by averaging carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling functions. The relationship between soil microbial diversity and SMF was further explored. Results The results showed that the positive effects of soil microbial diversity on SMF was significantly affected by LUI. In general, LUI decreased SMF and both bacterial and fungal diversity. Cotton and wheat-maize rotation systems with relatively lower LUI showed higher microbial diversity and SMF compared with the vegetable system, which had the highest LUI and the lowest SMF. Moreover, bacterial but not fungal diversity drove this positive relationship between microbial diversity and SMF in both cotton and wheat-maize systems but not in the vegetable system, indicating a larger bacterial effect in lower LUI system. Random forest and structural equation modeling further confirmed bacterial diversity and composition contributed to SMF mainly via promoting carbon and phosphorus cycling. Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of LUI in influencing the relationships of biodiversity-SMF and further demonstrate that soil microbial diversity conservation with less anthropogenic disturbances is important for supporting soil functioning in agroecosystems.

TI  - The abundance of nitrogen cycle genes amoA and nifH depends on land-uses and soil types in South-Eastern Australia
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Nitrogen is a critical nutrient in plant-based primary production systems, therefore measurements of N cycling by microorganisms may add value to agricultural soil monitoring programs. Bacterial-mediated nitrogen cycling was investigated in soils from two broad land-uses (managed and remnant vegetation) across different Soil Orders from three geomorphic zones in Victoria, Australia, by examining the abundance of the genes amoA and nifH using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The aim of the study was to identify parameters influencing bacterial populations possessing the genes nifH and amoA, and examine their distribution at a regional scale across different management treatments. The gene amoA was most abundant in the neutral to slightly alkaline surface soils from Calcarosols in North-West Victoria. There was a highly significant (P < 0.001) interaction between land-use and geomorphic zones in terms of the abundance of amoA. Detection of the gene nifH was site specific with low copy number (less than 100 copies per nanogram of DNA) observed for some strongly acidic surface soil sites in North-East Victoria (Dermosols) and South-West Victoria (Sodosols/Chromosols), while nifH was more abundant in selected Calcarosols of North-West Victoria. The gene amoA was detected across more sites than nifH and was strongly influenced by land-use, with almost consistently greater abundance in managed compared to remnant sites, particularly for North-West and South-West Victoria. The abundance of nifH was not related to land-use, with similar copy numbers observed for both managed and remnant sites at some locations. For the gene nifH, there was no significant interaction between land-use and geomorphic zones, between managed and remnant sites or between the three geomorphic zones. Regression tree analysis revealed a number of likely soil chemical and microbial variables which may act as drivers of gene abundance of amoA and nifH. Variables identified as drivers for amoA included pH, Olsen P. microbial biomass carbon, nitrate and total nitrogen while for nifH the variables were microbial biomass carbon, electrical conductivity, microbial biomass nitrogen, total nitrogen and total potassium. Measures of N cycling genes could be used as an additional indicator of soil health to assess potential ecosystem functions. The spatial scale of the current study demonstrates that a landscape approach may assist soil health monitoring programs by evaluating N cycle gene abundance in the context of the different microbial and chemical conditions related to Soil Order and land-use management.

TI  - Nitrification of archaeal ammonia oxidizers in a high-temperature hot spring
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - The oxidation of ammonia by microbes has been shown to occur in diverse natural environments. However, the link of in situ nitrification activity to taxonomic identities of ammonia oxidizers in high-temperature environments remains poorly understood. Here, we studied in situ ammonia oxidation rates and the diversity of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA) in surface and bottom sediments at 77 degrees C in the Gongxiaoshe hot spring, Tengchong, Yunnan, China. The in situ ammonia oxidation rates measured by the N-15-NO3- pool dilution technique in the surface and bottom sediments were 4.80 and 5.30 nmol N g(-1) h(-1), respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) indicated that the archaeal 16S rRNA genes and amoA genes were present in the range of 0.128 to 1.96 x 10(8) and 2.75 to 9.80 x 10(5) gene copies g(-1) sediment, respectively, while bacterial amoA was not detected. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes showed high sequence similarity to thermophilic Candidatus Nitrosocaldus yellowstonii, which represented the most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTU) in both surface and bottom sediments. The archaeal predominance was further supported by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) visualization. The cell-specific rate of ammonia oxidation was estimated to range from 0.410 to 0.790 fmolNarchaeal cell(-1) h(-1), higher than those in the two US Great Basin hot springs. These results suggest the importance of archaeal rather than bacterial ammonia oxidation in driving the nitrogen cycle in terrestrial geothermal environments.

TI  - Characteristics, Sources, and Mechanisms of Soil Respiration under Simulated Rainfall in a Native Karst Forest in Southwestern China
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Rainfall significantly affects soil respiration rates by altering microbial activity and organic matter decomposition. In karst regions, it also impacts carbonate dissolution and precipitation, further influencing soil CO2 flux. Investigating the mechanism of rainfall's impact on soil respiration is essential for accurately evaluating and predicting changes in terrestrial ecosystems. However, our understanding of the interaction between rainfall and soil respiration in the extensive karst ecosystems of southwestern China remains limited. This study conducted field-based simulated rainfall experiments to examine variations in soil respiration rates and elucidate the associated control mechanisms through stable carbon isotope composition analysis. Simulated rainfall significantly increased the CO2 release via soil respiration. We observed significant differences in the delta C-13 value of soil-respired CO2 before and after simulated rainfall. Following the rain, the delta C-13 of soil-respired CO2 was enriched compared to that before the rain. Through isotope data analysis, we found that the increased soil CO2 emissions were primarily driven by heterotrophic respiration, likely stimulated via changes in soil moisture, affecting microbial growth conditions. Furthermore, the variation in soil moisture affected carbonate dissolution and precipitation, potentially increasing the soil CO2 release after rainfall. In conclusion, these findings expand our understanding of rainfall's effects on soil respiration in the native karst forests of southwestern China, contributing to the prediction of carbon cycling processes in such ecosystems. The data from this study have significant implications for addressing the release of greenhouse gases in efforts to combat climate change.

TI  - Quantifying regional effects of plastic mulch on soil nitrogen pools, cycles, and fluxes in rain-fed agroecosystems of the Loess Plateau
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Farmland surface soil mulching with plastic film is extensively used to enhance agricultural productivity in the Loess Plateau (LP). However, the effect of mulching on the key processes that dominate soil nitrogen dynamics is rarely assessed quantitatively. We quantified the responses of agroecosystem nitrogen cycling to plastic mulching using a comprehensive database drawn from mulching experiments in the LP. Our results indicated that through increasing the soil mineral and dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations, plastic mulching significantly enhanced the soil nitrogen availability by 36.6% at the regional scale, compared with traditional nonmulching. Mulching pattern, nitrogen application, and soil type were found to be the most significant drivers in determining nitrogen availability. Furthermore, nitrogen gaseous releases and hydrological leaching were significantly reduced by 7.0% and 9.4%, respectively, under plastic mulching, which led to an insignificant change in the soil total nitrogen pool. Nitrogen input level and soil organic carbon appeared to be the most important factors influencing soil nitrogen losses. Critically, along with increased root residue inputs to soil and improved water thermal conditions under mulching, soil microbial activity was increased significantly. This was indicated by enhanced microbial biomass nitrogen and soil nitrogen-related extracellular enzyme activity and was driven by nitrogen input, mulching duration, and soil carbon status. We generalize that in the rain-fed agroecosystems of the LP, plastic mulch will have little impact on nitrogen pool size, largely due to reduced gaseous and hydrological nitrogen losses and increased crop-sourced nitrogen inputs, but will strongly stimulate microbial growth, metabolism, and activities, which consequently will speed up biogeochemical cycles of soil nutrients.

TI  - Enhancement of Nitrogen Retention in Cow Manure Composting with Biochar: An Investigation into Migration and Regulation Mechanisms
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Context: Biochar can affect the storage and forms of nitrogen; thus, it may also play a role in altering the nitrogen cycle during the fermentation process of cow dung into organic fertilizer. Objective: To elucidate the mechanism and process of nitrogen transformation during the composting of cow manure with biochar, a comparative experiment was conducted. Method: This study investigates the use of biochar as a medium to enhance nitrogen storage during the aerobic composting of cow manure. The effectiveness was verified through a rapid composting experiment. Result and Conclusions: The results demonstrated that adding 5% biochar to the compost pile increased the total nitrogen content in manure by 12%. Specifically, the pyrrolic nitrogen in the composted cow manure increased from 38% to 44%, and the carbon-nitrogen ratio improved from 35% to 37%. Analysis of surface functional groups indicated that the C=O and C=C bonds in biochar played a key role in modifying nitrogen storage. Microbial analysis showed that biochar could significantly enhance the regional competitiveness of microorganisms, such as Cellvibrio, thereby boosting the expression of functional genes involved in the nitrification process, including amoABC, hao, and nxrAB. Therefore, adding 5% biochar not only enhances nitrogen storage in organic fertilizer but also changes the microbial population structure. Significance: This study carries substantial implications for the application of Biochar in the field, as well as for the development of microbial fertilizers based on cow manure.

TI  - Isolation of Oligotrophic Denitrifiers Carrying Previously Uncharacterized Functional Gene Sequences
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Oligotrophic denitrifying bacteria, including those belonging to the genera Herbaspirillum, Azospirillum, and Bradyrhizobium, were obtained using a single-cell isolation technique. The taxonomic composition of the denitrifier population was similar to those assessed by previous culture-independent studies. The sequencing of nitrite reductase and N2O reductase genes of these strains revealed previously unknown links between 16S rRNA and the denitrification-functional gene phylogenies. In particular, we identified Bradyrhizobium strains that harbor nirS sequences previously detected only in culture-independent studies.

TI  - Earthworm abundance and functional group diversity regulate plant litter decay and soil organic carbon level: A global meta-analysis
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - A previous review of earthworm impacts on greenhouse-gas emissions concluded that earthworms elevated soil CO2 emissions with no apparent influence on soil organic carbon (SOC), especially in laboratory incubations and in agroecosystems. This conclusion suggests that the elevated soil CO2 emissions may come from enhanced plant litter decomposition. Despite the known important role of earthworms on regulating ecosystem processes, a quantitative analysis of the relationship between earthworms and decomposition in global terrestrial ecosystems is still missing. Here, we present a quantitative synthesis of earthworm effects on plant litter decomposition and SOC based on 340 observations from 69 independent studies. We found a positive correlation between earthworm density and the rate of plant litter decay, and that the presence of earthworms doubled the amount of litter mass loss on average. The presence of all three (anecic, epigeic and endogeic) earthworm functional groups was associated with higher litter mass loss than when either one or two functional groups were present. Anecic earthworms caused the strongest effect on litter mass loss, followed by epigeic earthworms, and there was no apparent influence by endogeic worms. Although the effect of earthworms on SOC was not significant based on all observations, the presence of any two of the three functional groups alone or two (epigeic and endogeic, or anecic and endogeic) and three (anecic, epigeic and endogeic) functional groups together decreased SOC concentrations. Our results indicate that the effect of earthworms on litter and SOC decay depends strongly on earthworm functional groups and diversity, and that a high diversity of earthworm functional groups accelerates litter mass loss and SOC decay. We anticipate that changes in land management practices are likely to alter ecosystem carbon cycling through alteration of earthworm abundance and diversity.

TI  - The molecular composition of soil dissolved organic matter regulated by reactive mineral-associated organic matter under a broad range of climates
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Organic matter retained by reactive minerals constitutes an essential mechanism for long-term storage of carbon in soil, a process that is governed by climate factors. However, how the reactive mineral-associated organic matter affects the composition of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM) across a broad range of climates remains unclear. In this study, the contents of reactive minerals and their associated organic matter were determined by the chemical extraction method. Moreover, the effects of organic matter retained by reactive minerals on soil DOM composition were investigated at molecular level across a wide environmental gradient, by employing Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance and statistical analyses. The results of FT-ICR-MS and correlation analyses indicated that the relative abundances of carbohydrates and proteins/amino sugars decreased, while the relative abundance of condensed aromatics increased with the increase of the content of organic matter retained by reactive minerals per unit mass (i.e., (OC)RN) in soils. We highlighted that the adsorption and dissolution processes of DOM molecules, especially aromatic molecules, on reactive minerals played crucial roles in regulating the molecular composition of DOM in soil solution. Furthermore, (OC)RN was controlled by climate-driven chemical weathering (e.g., precipitation). Our results imply that (OC)RN is a key variable for regulating soil DOM composition under the impacts of climates, and can be used in developing prediction models for carbon cycling.

TI  - Response of aquatic plant decomposition to invasive algal organic matter mediated by the co-metabolism effect in eutrophic lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The decomposition of aquatic plant residues changes by the invasive algal organic matter in eutrophic lakes, however, the driving mechanisms of these biogeochemistry processes are still far from clear. In this study, a series of microcosms was constructed to simulate the mixed decomposition processes of aquatic plant residues with invasive algae as long as 205 days. Three aquatic plants (Potamogeton malaianus, Nymphoides peltatum, and Phragmites australis) and algae were collected from a typical eutrophic lake. The addition of algae promoted the decomposition of three plant residues based on the mass loss, and the positive co-metabolism effect was produced. The co-metabolism intensity was 8%-25% on the water surface and 19%-45% on the water-sediment interface, respectively. In addition, the response of three aquatic plant residues to the algal organic matter was different with their co-metabolism intensities in the order of P. australis > P. malaianus > N. peltatum on both the water surface and water-sediment interface. The phylum number of bacteria attached to the surface of plant residues increased from 27 to 52. The abundance of Bacteroidetes, which had the function of decomposing refractory organic matter, increased most significantly at the final incubation. At present, shallow lakes are under the double pressure of eutrophication and global warming, and the intensity and duration of algal blooms are increasing. Therefore, the co-metabolism effect of the residue decomposition process described here may change the carbon cycle strength and increase the greenhouse gas emissions of lakes and need to be taken into account in future lake management.

TI  - Mangrove crab intestine and habitat sediment microbiomes cooperatively work on carbon and nitrogen cycling
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems, where litter and organic components are degraded and converted into detrital materials, support rich coastal fisheries resources. Sesarmid (Grapsidae) crabs, which feed on mangrove litter, play a crucial role in material flow in carbon-rich and nitrogen-limited mangrove ecosystems; however, the process of assimilation and conversion into detritus has not been well studied. In this study, we performed microbiome analyses of intestinal bacteria from three species of mangrove crab and five sediment positions in the mud lobster mounds, including the crab burrow wall, to study the interactive roles of crabs and sediment in metabolism. Metagenome analysis revealed species-dependent intestinal profiles, especially in Neosarmatium smithi, while the sediment microbiome was similar in all positions, albeit with some regional dependency. The microbiome profiles of crab intestines and sediments were significantly different in the MDS analysis based on OTU similarity; however, 579 OTUs (about 70% of reads in the crab intestinal microbiome) were identical between the intestinal and sediment bacteria. In the phenotype prediction, cellulose degradation was observed in the crab intestine. Cellulase activity was detected in both crab intestine and sediment. This could be mainly ascribed to Demequinaceae, which was predominantly found in the crab intestines and burrow walls. Nitrogen fixation was also enriched in both the crab intestines and sediments, and was supported by the nitrogenase assay. Similar to earlier reports, sulfur-related families were highly enriched in the sediment, presumably degrading organic compounds as terminal electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions. These results suggest that mangrove crabs and habitat sediment both contribute to carbon and nitrogen cycling in the mangrove ecosystem via these two key reactions.

TI  - Land use driven change in soil pH affects microbial carbon cycling processes
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Soil microorganisms act as gatekeepers for soil-atmosphere carbon exchange by balancing the accumulation and release of soil organic matter. However, poor understanding of the mechanisms responsible hinders the development of effective land management strategies to enhance soil carbon storage. Here we empirically test the link between microbial ecophysiological traits and topsoil carbon content across geographically distributed soils and land use contrasts. We discovered distinct pH controls on microbial mechanisms of carbon accumulation. Land use intensification in low-pH soils that increased the pH above a threshold (similar to 6.2) leads to carbon loss through increased decomposition, following alleviation of acid retardation of microbial growth. However, loss of carbon with intensification in near-neutral pH soils was linked to decreased microbial biomass and reduced growth efficiency that was, in turn, related to trade-offs with stress alleviation and resource acquisition. Thus, less-intensive management practices in near-neutral pH soils have more potential for carbon storage through increased microbial growth efficiency, whereas in acidic soils, microbial growth is a bigger constraint on decomposition rates.

It concludes that the fundamental principles and problems of microbial ecology on land and sea are similar. These include the basis in microbial physiology, the diversity in microbial metabolism and the fact that microbes perform key roles in element cycling within the biosphere and in carbon cycling in almost all ecosystems. Finally, the paper proposes that one of the major future roles of microbial ecology will be to achieve a more profound understanding of microbial diversity in nature.

TI  - Multifarious Responses of Forest Soil Microbial Community Toward Climate Change
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Forest soils are a pressing subject of worldwide research owing to the several roles of forests such as carbon sinks. Currently, the living soil ecosystem has become dreadful as a consequence of several anthropogenic activities including climate change. Climate change continues to transform the living soil ecosystem as well as the soil microbiome of planet Earth. The majority of studies have aimed to decipher the role of forest soil bacteria and fungi to understand and predict the impact of climate change on soil microbiome community structure and their ecosystem in the environment. In forest soils, microorganisms live in diverse habitats with specific behavior, comprising bulk soil, rhizosphere, litter, and deadwood habitats, where their communities are influenced by biotic interactions and nutrient accessibility. Soil microbiome also drives multiple crucial steps in the nutrient biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, and sulfur cycles). Soil microbes help in the nitrogen cycle through nitrogen fixation during the nitrogen cycle and maintain the concentration of nitrogen in the atmosphere. Soil microorganisms in forest soils respond to various effects of climate change, for instance, global warming, elevated level of CO2, drought, anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, increased precipitation, and flood. As the major burning issue of the globe, researchers are facing the major challenges to study soil microbiome. This review sheds light on the current scenario of knowledge about the effect of climate change on living soil ecosystems in various climate-sensitive soil ecosystems and the consequences for vegetation-soil-climate feedbacks.

TI  - Soil microorganisms decrease barley biomass uniformly across contrasting nitrogen availability
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Aims: Microorganisms play a dichotomous role in the soil nitrogen cycle through mineralization and immobilization. We aimed to understand how nitrogen availability modifies the effect of microorganisms on plant growth. We hypothesized that soil microorganisms would increase plant biomass following amendment with a substrate rich in organic nitrogen (net mineralization), be neutral when adding inorganic nitrogen, and decrease biomass when adding organic nitrogen-limited substrate (nitrogen competition). Method: Barley (Hordeum vulgare L., cv. Evergreen) was exposed to either i) limited, organically bound nitrogen, ii) organically bound nitrogen or iii) inorganic nitrogen. In these amendments, we assessed the differences in plant biomass and physiology between plants with or without soil microbiome addition. Results: The soil microbiome reduced shoot biomass equally (12%) across all nitrogen amendments. However, nitrogen availability did modulate the effect of the soil microbiome on plant physiological parameters associated with nitrogen deficiency. Conclusions: The results indicate that the net negative effect of complex microbiomes on shoot biomass is independent of nitrogen availability. Thus, microbiome addition was deleterious to biomass even in a nutrientstress-free environment. We suggest that strategies for improving plant growth through manipulation of microorganisms should not exclusively focus on beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms, but also include minimizing plant metabolic costs of microbiome interactions.

TI  - Hardwood mixtures facilitate leaf litter decomposition and soil nitrogen mineralization in conifer plantations
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Productivity in conifer plantations can be increased by hardwood mixture. However, the underlying mechanisms that govern the relationship between hardwood mixture and productivity remain poorly understood, particularly with respect to nutrient cycling. We investigated how and to what extent hardwood mixtures alter nitrogen amounts in leaf litterfall, leaf litter decomposition rates, and soil nitrogen mineralization rates in an experiment that used different thinning intensities (i.e., a non-thinned "control" group with few hardwoods, a 33%-thinned "weak" group with a small amount of hardwoods, and a 67%-thinned "intensive" group with abundant hardwoods) in a conifer Cryptomeria japonica plantation (38-year old). Most of the hardwoods were 15-year old trees that have been regenerated after the first thinning. The annual leaf litterfall amount for the conifer was highest in the control group and lowest in the intensive group, whereas the reverse was true for hardwoods, although the hardwoods' annual leaf litterfall amount was approximately half that of conifers, even in the intensive group. Consequently, the annual amount of leaf litterfall of hardwoods and conifers combined was lowest in the intensive group. However, the total amount of nitrogen in the annual leaf litterfall of hardwoods and conifers combined did not differ according to thinning intensity, because the mass-based nitrogen concentration in the leaf litterfall of hardwoods was twice that of conifers. The leaf litter decomposition rate in hardwoods was approximately three times faster than that in conifers irrespective of thinning intensity, mainly due to the lower carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio. Thus, the total amount of nitrogen in the decomposed leaves of hardwoods and conifers combined, calculated by multiplying the total amount of nitrogen in the annual leaf litterfall of hardwoods and conifers by the decomposition rate and summing the results, was highest in the intensive group. In soil from shallow depths (0-10 cm), the nitrogen mineralization rate increased in the order of control, weak, and intensive, attributable primarily to the C:N ratio, which decreased in the same order. The results indicated that increasing the hardwood content by intensive thinning significantly enhances the availability of soil inorganic nitrogen in conifer plantations, by facilitating leaf litter decomposition and soil nitrogen mineralization. These findings indicate that hardwood mixtures can increase forest productivity by enhancing nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Biochar mitigates nitrogen deposition-induced enhancement of soil N2O emissions in a subtropical forest
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB  - Subtropical forests are significant contributors to N2O emissions with consequences for climate regulation. Biochar application has emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate soil N2O emissions, yet its effects and the underlying mechanisms under nitrogen (N) deposition in subtropical forests remain poorly understood. A comprehensive 3-year field study within a subtropical forest reveals that N deposition led to a significant increase in soil N2O emissions by 14.6-25.1% annually. However, biochar application resulted in a substantial reduction of these emissions, ranging from 8.0-20.8% each year. Notably, the mitigation effect of biochar was particularly pronounced when N deposition was occurring, leading to an even greater reduction in N2O emissions by 14.2-22.0% annually. This mitigation effect is attributed to biochar's capacity to lower the nitrification and denitrification rates of soil via reducing levels of ammonium N and water-soluble organic N. Additionally, biochar decreased the abundance of critical microbial genes, including AOAamoA, nirK and nirS, and reduced the activity of key enzymes such as nitrate and nitrite reductase. These findings highlight the potential of straw biochar to effectively mitigate soil N2O emissions in subtropical forests experiencing N deposition, offering important insights for supporting ecosystem sustainability under global climate change.

TI  - Warming effects on permafrost ecosystem carbon fluxes associated with plant nutrients
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Large uncertainties exist in carbon (C)-climate feedback in permafrost regions, partly due to an insufficient understanding of warming effects on nutrient availabilities and their subsequent impacts on vegetation C sequestration. Although a warming climate may promote a substantial release of soil C to the atmosphere, a warming-induced increase in soil nutrient availability may enhance plant productivity, thus offsetting C loss from microbial respiration. Here, we present evidence that the positive temperature effect on carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes may be weakened by reduced plant nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations in a Tibetan permafrost ecosystem. Although experimental warming initially enhanced ecosystem CO2 uptake, the increased rate disappeared after the period of peak plant growth during the early growing season, even though soil moisture was not a limiting factor in this swamp meadow ecosystem. We observed that warming did not significantly affect soil extractable N or P during the period of peak growth, but decreased both N and P concentrations in the leaves of dominant plant species, likely caused by accelerated plant senescence in the warmed plots. The attenuated warming effect on CO2 assimilation during the late growing season was associated with lowered leaf N and P concentrations. These findings suggest that warming-mediated nutrient changes may not always benefit ecosystem C uptake in permafrost regions, making our ability to predict the C balance in these warming-sensitive ecosystems more challenging than previously thought.

TI  - Tire Wear Particles Exposure Enhances Denitrification in Soil by Enriching Labile DOM and Shaping the Microbial Community
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Tire wear particles (TWP) are emerging contaminants in the soil environment due to their widespread occurrence and potential threat to soil health. However, their impacts on soil biogeochemical processes remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of TWP at various doses and their leachate on soil respiration and denitrification using a robotized continuous-flow incubation system in upland soil. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and high-throughput sequencing were employed to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the TWP effects. We show that TWP increased soil CO2, N-2, and N2O emissions, which were attributed to the changes in content and composition of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM) induced by TWP and their leachate. Specifically, the labile DOM components (H/C >= 1.5 and transformation >10), which were crucial in shaping the denitrifying community, were significantly enriched by TWP exposure. Furthermore, the abundances of denitrification genes (nirK/S and nosZ-I) and the specific denitrifying genera Pseudomonas were increased following TWP exposure. Our findings provide new insights into impacts of TWP on carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil, highlighting that TWP exposure may exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and fertilizer N loss, posing adverse effects on soil fertility in peri-urban areas and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Contrasting Warming and Ozone Effects on Denitrifiers Dominate Soil N2O Emissions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) in the atmosphere is a major greenhouse gas and reacts with volatile organic compounds to create ozone (an air pollutant) in the troposphere. Climate change factors such as warming and elevated ozone (eO(3)) affect N2O fluxes, but the direction and magnitude of these effects are uncertain and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined the impact of simulated warming (control + 3.6 degrees C) and eO(3) (control + 45 ppb) on soil N2O fluxes in a soybean agroecosystem. Results obtained showed that warming significantly increased soil labile C, microbial biomass, and soil N mineralization, but eO(3) reduced these parameters. Warming enhanced N2O-producing denitrifers (nirS- and nirK-type), corresponding to increases in both the rate and sum of N2O emissions. In contrast, eO(3) significantly reduced both N2O-producing and N2O-consuming (nosZ-type) denitrifiers but had no impact on N2O emissions. Further, eO(3) offsets the effects of warming on soil labile C, microbial biomass, and the population size of denitrifiers but still increased N2O emissions, indicating a direct effect of temperature on N2O emissions. Together, these findings suggest that warming may promote N2O production through increasing both the abundance and activities of N2O-producing microbes, positively feeding back to the ongoing climate change.

TI  - Effect of Biochar on Organic Matter Conservation and Metabolic Quotient of Soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB  - Emission of CO2 resulting from mineralization of organic carbon in agricultural soil is main pathways of greenhouse gas emission. In this research, effect of biochar on humus, organic carbon accumulation, and metabolic quotient of soil were investigated. Different contents of biochar were added in two kinds of soil with different fertility. According to the results, biochar played a positive role on promoting the formation of soil humus. Contents of humic acids (HAs), fulvic acids (FAs), and humins (HMs) in treatment with biochar increased obviously, which was benefit to the stability of soil organic carbon pool. After 210 days incubation, content of HAs increased 9.8% to 13.6%; content of FAs increased 17.2% to 20.8%; content of HMs increased 20.5% to 22.6% compared with control. Biochar promoted the accumulation of nutrient elements thereby improved the soil quality. In addition, biochar accelerated the formation of carbohydrate, esters, aromatics and other organic macromolecules, which is difficult to decompose by soil microbial, resulting in the stability increase of organic carbon. Moreover, after 210 -days incubation, metabolic quotient (qCO2) in soils with 8% biochar decreased 5% to 10% compared with control, suggesting that biochar has positive effect on the ecological function of soil. Therefore, it can be concluded that biochar can affect on soil carbon cycle by changing soil carbon characteristics.

TI  - Influence of vegetation, temperature, and water content on soil carbon distribution and mineralization in four high Arctic soils
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
AB  - Soil organic matter distributions, reservoirs, and mineralization rates in tundra soils are important factors for understanding biogeochemical carbon cycling. This study focuses on spatial trends and environmental controls of soil carbon distribution and microbial soil respiration in 4 tundra vegetation communities in an arctic valley in NE-Greenland (74 degrees N), including Dryas and Cassiope heaths, Salix snow bed, and fen vegetation. Measured total soil organic carbon in the upper 50 cm averaged (-+/-SD) 11.0 +/- 1.5 kg C m(-2) with spatial variations strongly affected by vegetation, hydrology, and buried organic layers. Observed Soil CO2 concentrations and effluxes were simulated with a steady-state diffusion model using laboratory measured CO2 productions as input. Simulated CO2 profiles and CO2 effluxes (up to 3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) agreed with field observations and revealed the importance of both vegetation- and depth-specific CO2 production and CO2 diffusion for understanding the spatial variation in near-surface Soil CO2 gas dynamics. These results confirm that molecular diffusion dominates gas transport in the studied soils; but also that the complexity Of CO2 production/transport coupled to soil heterogeneity (in particular the litter layer) complicates the application of soil-diffusion models to estimate seasonal trends of soil gas effluxes.

TI  - The seasonal dynamics of soil microbial biomass of a Larix gmelinii forest after wildfire
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Projected changes in the earth's climate have spawned a rush to better understand the global carbon cycle. Understanding the dynamics of soil microbial biomass carbon is important but poorly understood aspect of this cycle. In particular, fires can dramatically alter microbial communities and therefore soil carbon cycles. We took soil samples from Larix gmelinii forests that were burned in two different years (2002 and 2008) and compared them with adjacent unburned area. Soils samples were collected monthly from May to October (2010). We used a fumigation-extraction method (FE) to examine seasonal dynamics of soil microbial biomass carbon (C-mic) and soil microbial biomass nitrogen (N-mic) of the soils burned in different years, and we compared the relationship between C-mic, N-mic and other soil characteristics. There were significant differences in C-mic and N-mic of the soils burned in different years (P<0.01). There were substantial fluctuations in soil microbial biomass and nitrogen within all the sample plots: C-mic peaked in the early spring, fluctuated slightly during the growing season, increased after the growing season, peaked in the autumn, and then began to decline. C-mic and N-mic were positively correlated with soil water content. C-mic was negatively correlated with soil temperature, while N-mic was not significantly correlated with soil temperature. C-mic and N-mic were not significantly correlated with ammonium, pH or nitrate.

TI  - A trait-based understanding of wood decomposition by fungi
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - As the primary decomposers of organic material in terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are critical agents of the global carbon cycle. Yet our ability to link fungal community composition to ecosystem functioning is constrained by a limited understanding of the factors accounting for different wood decomposition rates among fungi. Here we examine which traits best explain fungal decomposition ability by combining detailed trait-based assays on 34 saprotrophic fungi from across North America in the laboratory with a 5-y field study comprising 1,582 fungi isolated from 74 decomposing logs. Fungal growth rate (hyphal extension rate) was the strongest single predictor of fungal-mediated wood decomposition rate under laboratory conditions, and accounted for up to 27% of the in situ variation in decomposition in the field. At the individual level, decomposition rate was negatively correlated with moisture niche width (an indicator of drought stress tolerance) and with the production of nutrient-mineralizing extracellular enzymes. Together, these results suggest that decomposition rates strongly align with a dominance-tolerance life-history tradeoff that was previously identified in these isolates, forming a spectrum from slow-growing, stress-tolerant fungi that are poor decomposers to fast-growing, highly competitive fungi with fast decomposition rates. Our study illustrates how an understanding of fungal trait variation could improve our predictive ability of the early and midstages of wood decay, to which our findings are most applicable. By mapping our results onto the biogeographic distribution of the dominance-tolerance trade-off across North America, we approximate broad-scale patterns in intrinsic fungal-mediatedwood decomposition rates.

TI  - Leveraging Fine-Scale Variation and Heterogeneity of the Wetland Soil Microbiome to Predict Nutrient Flux on the Landscape
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Shifts in agricultural land use over the past 200 years have led to a loss of nearly 50% of existing wetlands in the USA, and agricultural activities contribute up to 65% of the nutrients that reach the Mississippi River Basin, directly contributing to biological disasters such as the hypoxic Gulf of Mexico "Dead" Zone. Federal efforts to construct and restore wetland habitats have been employed to mitigate the detrimental effects of eutrophication, with an emphasis on the restoration of ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling and retention. Soil microbial assemblages drive biogeochemical cycles and offer a unique and sensitive framework for the accurate evaluation, restoration, and management of ecosystem services. The purpose of this study was to elucidate patterns of soil bacteria within and among wetlands by developing diversity profiles from high-throughput sequencing data, link functional gene copy number of nitrogen cycling genes to measured nutrient flux rates collected from flow-through incubation cores, and predict nutrient flux using microbial assemblage composition. Soil microbial assemblages showed fine-scale turnover in soil cores collected across the topsoil horizon (0-5 cm; top vs bottom partitions) and were structured by restoration practices on the easements (tree planting, shallow water, remnant forest). Connections between soil assemblage composition, functional gene copy number, and nutrient flux rates show the potential for soil bacterial assemblages to be used as bioindicators for nutrient cycling on the landscape. In addition, the predictive accuracy of flux rates was improved when implementing deep learning models that paired connected samples across time.

TI  - Alterations in microbial-mediated methane, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus cycling within paddy soil induced by integrated rice-fish farming
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Rice paddies are crucial ecosystems, supporting dense microbial populations and playing a significant role in global food security. Integrated rice-fish farming has been recognized as an important agricultural production pattern to enhance agro-ecosystem stability and food productivity. Using metagenomic sequencing, we compared the microbial-mediated soil CH4, N, S, and P cycles in integrated rice-fish farming versus traditional rice monoculture, exploring their potential coupling mechanisms within microbes. Integrated rice-fish farming has significantly impacted these microbial-mediated cycles in paddy soil, altering the overall functional diversity, sum abundance, and microbial host diversity for the CH4, N, S, and P cycling genes. Specifically, it suppressed the denitrification, assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANR), assimilatory sulfate reduction (ASR), thiosulfate oxidation, organic phosphoester hydrolysis, and two-component system pathways and most of their associated functional genes, while enhanced the acetoclastic methanogenesis and the reduction of tetrathionate to thiosulfate processes. Compared to traditional rice monoculture, integrated rice-fish farming resulted in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) with fewer and more isolated biogeochemical cycling genes, lacking potential couplings among multi-element cycles. Additionally, this farming approach increased the soil nutrient levels including the total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total sulfur (TS), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, which have been identified as the most crucial factors driving the alterations in microbial functional genes/pathways involved in biogeochemical cycling processes in our study. Overall, integrated rice-fish farming dynamically altered the microbial-mediated CH4, N, S, and P cycles and their potential couplings within microbes through promoting the soil nutrient levels, which could favor rice growth, thus maintaining food security and providing refined knowledge for maintaining soil sustainability.

TI  - The response of dissolved organic matter dynamics to flood events in tidal estuaries
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tidal estuaries serve as critical zones for biogeochemical connectivity between terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems. With climate change magnifying the impact of flood events on riverine system, dissolved organic matter (DOM) cycling, the largest reactive elemental pool in ecosystems, in tidal estuaries tend to be more complex and remain poorly understood. To address this gap, the response of DOM dynamics to flood events in a typical tidal estuary was explored. Results showed that although tidal waves constrained DOM chemistry under normal hydrological conditions, significant chemical changes of DOM were triggered by floods under flood-influenced hydrological conditions. Flood events resulted in lower salinity and pH but higher concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a compared to normal period. Significantly higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in flood period than normal period were also observed. Molecular analysis revealed increased DOM diversity, higher aromaticity, unsaturation, and molecular weight, indicating enhanced terrestrial inputs and reduced biodegradability in the flood period than the normal period. These variations are likely attributable to flood-induced hydrological impacts on river ecosystems (e.g., erosion of riparian soil and sediments addition). Furthermore, with the integration of our results and global flood information, significant input of the recalcitrant DOC induced by floods was uncovered in global rivers and estuaries, hinting the enhancement of carbon transportation from terrestrial to riverine ecosystems driven by floods. This work highlights the substantial impact of floods on DOM dynamics and carbon cycling in estuaries, with broader implications for coastal ecosystem resilience under changing climate regimes.

TI  - Determining the influence of meteorological, environmental, and anthropogenic activity variables on the atmospheric CO2 concentration in the arid and semi-arid regions: A case study in the Middle East
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
AB  - Climate change and the resulting warming caused by human activities, such as releasing greenhouse gases (GHG), notably carbon dioxide (CO2), are paramount concerns in the contemporary era. Therefore, it is essential to understand spatial and temporal variations of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (XCO2) on national and international scales and the role of controlling variables. This research examines the role of controlling variables on XCO2 by utilizing spatiotemporal modeling, correlation analysis, and machine learning methods to determine the sinks and sources of CO2 and their changes in the Middle East (ME). First, XCO2 data from the OCO-2 satellite spanning from 2015 to 2021 were employed for spatiotemporal analysis. The temporal analysis of XCO2 showed peak levels during spring (May) and the lowest levels during summer (September). Additionally, the spatial dispersion of XCO2 revealed significant spatial heterogeneity influenced by land cover. Areas with high vegetation abundance and suitable weather conditions exhibited minimum XCO2 levels, while vice versa occurred. Next, the correlation analysis between the principal controlling variables and XCO2 revealed that, except for vegetation abundance and anthropogenic CO2 emissions, they exhibited predominantly negative and positive correlations throughout the year, respectively. However, the correlation patterns for temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed varied across different months, showing both negative and positive relationships depending on the month. Recognizing that simple correlation alone cannot determine which variables played the most significant role in XCO2 each month, this study employed machine learning and Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) techniques. The results showed that, except for March and September, when precipitation and wind speed respectively had the most significant influence on determining XCO2, air temperature played the dominant role in other months. Additionally, the average monthly results revealed that air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and vegetation abundance, respectively, played the most significant roles in XCO2. In contrast, CO2 emissions had the most negligible impact. These results highlight the considerable influence of meteorological and environmental variables on regulating XCO2 levels and distributions throughout the ME. By elucidating the seasonality of the carbon cycle and identifying key XCO2 drivers over the ME, this study provides valuable insights to guide regional climate change mitigation policies and further analysis of vulnerable semi-arid ecosystems.

TI  - Elevated CO2 and O3 alter soil nitrogen transformations beneath trembling aspen, paper birch, and sugar maple
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Nitrogen cycling in northern temperate forest ecosystems could change under increasing atmospheric CO2 and tropospheric O-3 as a result of quantitative and qualitative changes in plant litter production. At the Aspen Free Air CO2-O-3 Enrichment (FACE) experiment, we previously found that greater substrate inputs to soil under elevated CO2 did not alter gross N transformation rates in the first 3 years of the experiment. We hypothesized that greater litter production under elevated CO2 would eventually cause greater gross N transformation rates and that CO2 effects would be nullified by elevated O-3. Following our original study, we continued measurement of gross N transformation rates for an additional four years. From 1999 to 2003, gross N mineralization doubled, N immobilization increased 4-fold, but changes in microbial biomass N and soil total N were not detected. We observed year-to-year variation in N transformation rates, which peaked during a period of foliar insect damage. Elevated CO2 caused equivalent increases in gross rates of N mineralization (+34%) and NH4+ immobilization (+36%). These results indicate greater rates of N turnover under elevated CO2, but do not indicate a negative feedback between elevated CO2 and soil N availability. Elevated O-3 decreased gross N mineralization (-16%) and had no effect on NH4+ immobilization, indicating reduced N availability under elevated O-3. The effects of CO2 and O-3 on N mineralization rates were mainly related to changes in litter production, whereas effects on N immobilization were likely influenced by changes in litter chemistry and production. Our findings also indicate that concomitant increases in atmospheric CO2 and O-3 could lead to a negative feedback on N availability.

TI  - Effects of diversionary feeding on abundance of microbes involved in soil nitrogen cycling on a Mediterranean mountain
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - Soil microorganisms maintain soil functions, playing a key role in nutrient cycling. However, human activities may alter ecological processes through, for instance, wildlife management tools, which affect environment conditions. Some management tools, such as diversionary feeding, are a source of organic matter and promote high animal densities in small areas, which could affect soil properties and nutrient cycling. This study evaluated how diversionary food inputs that aim to manage an exotic wild ungulate (Ammotragus lervia) can affect the soil potential for microbial N cycling on a Mediterranean mountain in SE Spain. We quantified the functional genes involved in N cycling present in soil exposed to diversionary feeding and compared soil characteristics from three areas: feeding station soil, contour area soil (surrounding the feeding station) and a reference soil (not influenced by supplementary feeding). Our results showed that the amount of the amoA-arch gene (from ammonia-oxidising archaea), the nifH gene (associated with N-fixation), the nirK gene (associated with denitrification) and the ureC gene (associated with ureolysis) were smaller in the feeding stations than in other areas. However, the nirS and nosZ genes (associated with denitrification) were more abundant in soil from feeding stations than in the reference soil. Our results suggest that diversionary feeding modifies microbial abundance and alters nitrogen cycle dynamics because of nutrient inputs and biochemical changes in soil.

TI  - Ontogenic succession of thermokarst thaw ponds is linked to dissolved organic matter quality and microbial degradation potential
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - Warming climate is thawing the permafrost in arctic and subarctic regions, leading to formation of thermokarst ponds. During the formation and geomorphological succession of these ponds, carbon that has been trapped in frozen soils for thousands of years is hydrologically mobilized and returned to the active carbon cycle. We sampled 12 thermokarst ponds representing three different stages of pond succession to study the potential of microbial communities to metabolize the organic carbon in the water. We investigated the quality of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water column based on the spectrophotometric and fluorometric properties of the chromophoric dissolved organic matter combined with parallel factor analysis and the potential of the microbial community for degrading these carbon compounds based on genetic markers related to carbon degradation. Our analysis showed a clear difference in the DOC quality across the different developmental stages. In the younger ponds, organic matter quality suggested that it was originating from the degrading permafrost and in the metagenomes collected from these ponds, the normalized abundance of genes related to degradation of carbon compounds was higher. There was also a shift in the degradation potential in the water column of the ponds, with higher potential for organic matter degradation in deeper, anoxic layers. In conclusion, our results show that the DOC quality and the genetic potential of the microbial community for carbon cycling change across the pond ontogeny, suggesting a capacity of the microbial communities to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

TI  - Effects of Soil Warming and Nitrogen Addition on Soil Respiration in a New Zealand Tussock Grassland
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Soil respiration (R-S) represents a large terrestrial source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Global change drivers such as climate warming and nitrogen deposition are expected to alter the terrestrial carbon cycle with likely consequences for R-S and its components, autotrophic (R-A) and heterotrophic respiration (R-H). Here we investigate the impacts of a 3 degrees C soil warming treatment and a 50 kg ha(-1) y(-1) nitrogen addition treatment on R-S, R-H and their respective seasonal temperature responses in an experimental tussock grassland. Average respiration in untreated soils was 0.96 +/- 0.09 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) over the course of the experiment. Soil warming and nitrogen addition increased R-S by 41% and 12% respectively. These treatment effects were additive under combined warming and nitrogen addition. Warming increased R-H by 37% while nitrogen addition had no effect. Warming and nitrogen addition affected the seasonal temperature response of R-S by increasing the basal rate of respiration (R-10) by 14% and 20% respectively. There was no significant interaction between treatments for R10. The treatments had no impact on activation energy (E-0). The seasonal temperature response of R-H was not affected by either warming or nitrogen addition. These results suggest that the additional CO2 emissions from New Zealand tussock grassland soils as a result of warming-enhanced R-S constitute a potential positive feedback to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.

TI  - Linking potential nitrification rates, nitrogen cycling genes and soil properties after remediating the agricultural soil contaminated with heavy metal and fungicide
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Apart from the contaminant removal, the remediation of agricultural soil should also pay more attention to soil nutrient retention and biogeochemical cycling. This study aimed to evaluate changes of soil properties, potential nitrification rates (PNRs), and functional gene abundances and link their relationships after remediating co-contaminated agricultural soil with Medicago saliva L. (alfalfa) planting, alone or together with biochar application. Compared with the control (CK), alfalfa planting, alone or together with biochar application, could significantly increase soil organic matter (SOM) contents and discrepantly affect soil pH values. The PNRs of the amended treatments were significantly higher than that of the CK. Moreover, alfalfa plantings also enhanced the abundances of functional genes related to soil nitrification and denitrification, with the sole exception of nosZ gene. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the PNRs were best described by the gene abundance ratios of AOB amoA/nifH and nirS gene abundances. Compared with the CK, alfalfa planting, alone or with biochar application, could restore nitrogen cycling in the co-contaminated agricultural soil and enhance the PNRs via decreasing contaminant bio-availabilities and increasing SOM contents and gene abundance ratios of AOB amoA/nifH.

TI  - Responses of Nitrogen-Cycling Microorganisms to Dazomet Fumigation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The influence of soil fumigation on microorganisms involved in transforming nitrogen remains little understood, despite the use of fumigants for many decades to control soil-borne pathogens and plant-parasitic nematodes. We used real-time PCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing techniques to monitor changes in the diversity and community structure of microorganisms associated with nitrogen transfer after the soil was fumigated with dazomet (DZ). We also examined nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from these microorganisms present in fumigated fluvo-aquic soil and lateritic red soil. Fumigation with DZ significantly reduced the abundance of 16S rRNA and nitrogen cycling functional genes (nifH, AOA amoA, AOB amoA, nxrB, narG, napA, nirK, nirS, cnorB, qnorB, and nosZ). At the same time, N2O production rates increased between 9.9 and 30 times after fumigation. N2O emissions were significantly correlated with NH4+, dissolved amino acids and microbial biomass nitrogen, but uncorrelated with functional gene abundance. Diversity indices showed that DZ temporarily stimulated bacterial diversity as well as caused a significant change in bacterial community composition. For example, DZ significantly decreased populations of N-2-fixing bacteria Mesorhizobium and Paenibacillus, nitrifiers Nitrosomonas, and the denitrifiers Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Paracoccus. The soil microbial community had the ability to recover to similar population levels recorded in unfumigated soils when the inhibitory effects of DZ fumigation were no longer evident. The microbial recovery rate, however, depended on the physicochemical properties of the soil. These results provided useful information for environmental safety assessments of DZ in China, for improving our understanding of the N-cycling pathways in fumigated soils, and for determining the potential responses of different N-cycling groups after fumigation.

TI  - Using phenotyping to visualize and identify selfish bacteria: a methods guide
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Polysaccharides are dominant components of plant and algal biomass, whose degradation is typically mediated by heterotrophic bacteria. These bacteria use extracellular enzymes to hydrolyze polysaccharides to oligosaccharides that are then also available to other bacteria. Recently, a new mechanism of polysaccharide processing-"selfish" uptake-has been recognized, initially among gut-derived bacteria. In "selfish" uptake, polysaccharides are bound at the outer membrane, partially hydrolyzed, and transported into the periplasmic space without loss of hydrolysis products, thus limiting the availability of smaller sugars to the surrounding environment. Selfish uptake is widespread in environments ranging from the ocean's cool, oxygen-rich, organic carbon-poor waters to the warm, carbon-rich, anoxic environment of the human gut. In this methods paper, we present a detailed guide to identifying selfish bacteria, including techniques for rapidly visualizing selfish uptake in complex bacterial communities, detecting selfish organisms, and distinguishing their activity from that of other community members.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the role of heterotrophic bacteria in the degradation of organic matter is critical for comprehending carbon cycling and microbial ecology across different environments. This study highlights the significant prevalence of "selfish uptake" among bacteria-often overlooked by standard microbial activity assessments-and presents the method used to quantify and identify these "selfish" bacteria. Found in diverse habitats such as anoxic gut environments, oxygenated waters, sediments, and soils, their widespread presence underscores the necessity of revisiting current methodologies to include these crucial organisms. By identifying and studying selfish bacteria, we can gain detailed insights into how microbial communities function, how carbon flows through ecosystems, and how these processes impact global biogeochemical cycles.

TI  - Adaptation of soil microbial growth to temperature: Using a tropical elevation gradient to predict future changes
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Terrestrial biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate are strongly modulated by the temperature response of soil microorganisms. Tropical forests, in particular, exert a major influence on global climate because they are the most productive terrestrial ecosystem. We used an elevation gradient across tropical forest in the Andes (a gradient of 20 degrees C mean annual temperature, MAT), to test whether soil bacterial and fungal community growth responses are adapted to long-term temperature differences. We evaluated the temperature dependency of soil bacterial and fungal growth using the leucine- and acetate-incorporation methods, respectively, and determined indices for the temperature response of growth: Q(10) (temperature sensitivity over a given 10oC range) and T-min (the minimum temperature for growth). For both bacterial and fungal communities, increased MAT (decreased elevation) resulted in increases in Q(10) and T-min of growth. Across a MAT range from 6 degrees C to 26 degrees C, the Q(10) and T-min varied for bacterial growth (Q(10-20) = 2.4 to 3.5; T-min = -8 degrees C to -1.5 degrees C) and fungal growth (Q(10-20) = 2.6 to 3.6; T-min = -6 degrees C to -1 degrees C). Thus, bacteria and fungi did not differ significantly in their growth temperature responses with changes in MAT. Our findings indicate that across natural temperature gradients, each increase in MAT by 1 degrees C results in increases in T-min of microbial growth by approximately 0.3 degrees C and Q(10-20) by 0.05, consistent with long-term temperature adaptation of soil microbial communities. A 2 degrees C warming would increase microbial activity across a MAT gradient of 6 degrees C to 26 degrees C by 28% to 15%, respectively, and temperature adaptation of microbial communities would further increase activity by 1.2% to 0.3%. The impact of warming on microbial activity, and the related impact on soil carbon cycling, is thus greater in regions with lower MAT. These results can be used to predict future changes in the temperature response of microbial activity over different levels of warming and over large temperature ranges, extending to tropical regions.

TI  - Plant-earthworm interactions: influence of age and proportion of casts in the soil on plant growth, morphology and nitrogen uptake
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Earthworms effect on plant growth is mediated by their dejections or "casts", a complex mixture of organic matter, minerals and microbes. In casts, different processes such as organic matter mineralization and signal molecule production follow a complex temporal dynamics. An adaptation of root morphology to cast dynamics could allow an efficient nitrogen capture by the plant.
   The plant Brachypodium distachyon was grown in a laboratory experiment with different proportions of casts of increasing ages. Casts were labelled with N-15 to quantify the plant N uptake from the casts. Plant biomass and morphology, especially root system structure, were analysed.
   The age of casts had an effect on fine root length, highlighting the importance of the dynamics of cast maturation in root adaptation. Plant biomass production was affected by the interaction between the age and proportion of casts. A positive correlation between the N-15 proportion in plant tissues and plant biomasses indicated that plants were more efficient in foraging N in casts than in the bulk soil.
   Our results suggested that both a timely adaptation of the root system structure and a significant proportion of casts are necessary to observe a positive effect of casts on plant growth.

TI  - Reductions in nitrous oxide emissions in diverse crop rotations linked to changes in prokaryotic community structure
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Diverse crop rotations are increasingly recognized as key to address the global food crisis and improve environmental sustainability, including reducing nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the specific effects on N2O emissions of different crops in these rotations and the underlying incidence on microbial processes remain underexplored. In a six-year field study, we compared N2O emissions from traditional wheat-maize rotation with diverse rotations, including legumes (peanut, soybean), ryegrass, sorghum, and sweet potato. We also examined the microbial functions associated with nitrogen cycling based on functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa (FAPROTAX) analysis. Our study showed that diversified crop rotations with reduced synthetic fertilization and irrigation can reduce N2O emissions by 23 %-49 % compared to conventional rotations. These reductions were supported by increases in soil organic carbon, soil carbon/nitrogen ratio and decreases in the relative abundance of denitrifying microorganisms, particularly observed in rotations with soybean and sweet potato. However, the spring maize and peanut-based rotation had higher emission factors than traditional wheat-maize rotation due to lower initial crop nitrogen uptake and lower nitrogen use efficiency, respectively. Changes in the microbial community structures of nitrification and denitrification processes, including increased activity of ammoniaoxidizing bacteria MND1 and archaea Candidatus Nitrososphaera in legume and sweet potato rotations, and a shift in denitrifying microbes of diverse rotations (a decrease in Rhodoplanes and an increase in Paracoccus), significantly contributed to the overall reductions in emissions in all other investigated rotation systems. Understanding the microbial mechanisms that control N2O emissions from agricultural soils will enable the development of more effective and crop-specific strategies to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - How climate and soil properties affect the abundances of nitrogen-cycling genes in nitrogen-treated ecosystems: a meta-analysis
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Purpose The abundance of nitrogen (N)-cycling genes is frequently used to indicate N cycling and predict N2O emissions. However, it remains difficult to clearly define how soil N-cycling genes in different ecosystems respond to anthropogenic N additions. Methods We applied a meta-analysis approach to examine data about N-cycling genes (nifH, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nirK, nirS, and nosZ) in different ecosystems from 119 peer-reviewed articles. Results In the ecosystems examined, the patterns of change in the abundances of the target genes, apart from AOA, varied considerably. This variation reflects the distinctive soil characteristics of ecosystems that develop when different forms of N are applied at different rates and over different durations. The nifH abundance decreased significantly, by 32.79%, in forests but did not change in grasslands and croplands. The AOB abundance increased in all three ecosystems, by 193.06% in grasslands, 73.26% in forests, and 151.86% in croplands, respectively. The denitrification gene abundances, namely the nirK, nirS, and nosZ, in croplands also increased significantly, by 60.74%, 47.42%, and 69.54%, respectively. Conclusion In general, climate factors and long-term applications of organic N at high rates had significant effects on the gene abundances in different ecosystems, through their influence on soil properties. An enhanced understanding of how N additions influence the abundance of other N-cycling functional genes can help us improve our ability to model the populations and activities of microbial functional communities and predict N fluxes.

TI  - Microbial functional gene diversity in natural secondary forest Ultisols
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - The diversity and biogeography of functional genes at a regional scale remains unclear. We hypothesize that plant community composition, nutrient availability, and spatial distance are driving factors for the functional gene diversity of soil microorganisms at a regional scale. We also hypothesize that different functional genes have different responses to environment. Using functional gene arrays (GeoChip 3.0), we examined microbial diversity, and influencing factors in Ultisols in 11 natural secondary forest plots in southern China which contained 4073 functional genes averagely. Carbon and nitrogen cycle genes were more variable than genes involved in phosphorus utilization, organic remediation, and metal resistance, in similar trends with soil substrate availability. Genes involved in nitrification being more variable than other nitrogen cycling genes; phytase genes being more variable than polyphosphate kinase genes (ppk) and exopolyphosphatase genes (ppx); exoglucanase and endoglucanase genes being more variable than cellobiase genes; lignin peroxidase genes (lip) being more variable than manganese peroxidase genes (mnp). Approximately 41% of the variation in gene composition could be explained by fine root surface area, available nitrogen, and the largest spatial scale factor, with the former two environmental factors over influenced spatial distance. Both environmental factors (represented by nutrient availability) and spatial distance influenced microbial functional gene composition, while the influence of spatial distance worked through environmental factors in natural secondary forest in Ultisols within approximately 500 km, providing insights into microbial biogeography from a functional gene perspective.

TI  - Taxonomic turnover dominates changes in soil microbial communities and functions in response to wildfire in subtropical forest
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Wildfire is a key disturbance factor driving biodiversity and structure of forest ecosystems. Despite wildfire shaping soil microbial communities, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we assessed soil microbial community dissimilarity in response to wildfire and quantified the contribution of taxonomic turnover and nestedness to reorganization of soil microbial communities in a subtropical forest in China. We further subdivided taxonomic turnover into homogeneous (R sim-homo ) and heterogeneous (R sim-hete ) based on turnover within/between functional groups. Results showed that reduced microbial richness and changed community structure after wildfire were predominantly driven by taxonomic turnover with equal contributions of R sim-homo and R sim-hete . Carbon cycle-related bacteria dominated R sim-homo , and the shift between carbon cycle- related and pathogenic bacteria dominated R sim-hete . Additionally, R sim-homo mainly occurred within saprotrophic fungi, while R sim-hete mainly occurred between symbiotrophic and saprotrophic fungi, manifesting a reduction in symbiotroph but stimulation of saprotroph. Generalized dissimilarity modeling (GDM) revealed that bacterial turnover was predicted by soil temperature and inorganic nitrogen while fungal turnover was predicted by soil temperature and carbon to nitrogen ratio. Our findings highlight the importance of taxonomic turnover in reorganizing post-fire soil microbial communities and functions, advancing our understanding of ecological processes and mechanisms of microbial responses to disturbance.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION
CP  - 1st International Symposium and the 4th Sino-Hungarian Workshop on Remediation and Restoration of Polluted Mining Areas
AB  - Mangrove ecosystem plays an important role in global cycling of nutrients. According to nutrient availability, microorganisms can optimize the allocation of C-, N- and P-degrading enzymes. Thus, in this study, enzymatic stoichiometry involved in C, N and P acquisition, and the microbial abundance were analysed in coastal mangrove sediments in two different seasons. Activities of 0-1,4-glucosidase (GLU), N-acetyl-B-glucosaminidase (NAG), acid phosphotase (ACP) and phenol oxidase (PHO) were determined, and then applied to calculate the enzymatic C:N (GLU:NAG), C:P (GLU:ACP) and N:P (NAG:ACP) acquisition, respectively. Besides, GLU:PHO was applied as relative recalcitrance of sediment organic matter (SOM). The results showed the enzymatic stoichiometry and microbial abundance had strongly seasonal variations. Compared to other ecosystems, GLU:ACP and NAG:ACP ratios were largely lower, suggesting that sediments in this ecosystem might be microbial P-limitation. Moreover, the higher GLU:PHO ratio implied that SOM in this ecosystem might be more decomposable. Furthermore, the imbalance of nutrients for microbial abundance was revealed by the strong correlations relating sediment N:P to GLU:NAG, GLU:ACP, and GLU:PHO. On the other hand, microbial P limitation in this ecosystem may enhance C storage and sequestration because the higher C contents in sediments of March than November occurred with lower GLU:ACP and NAG:ACP ratios as well as bacterial abundance.

TI  - The process of methanogenesis in paddy field sunder different elevated CO2 concentrations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Understanding the process of methanogenesis in paddy field sunder the scenarios of future climate changeis of great significance for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and regulating the soil carbon cycle. Methyl Coenzyme M Reductase subunit A(mcrA) of methanogens is arate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the final step of CH4 production. However, the mechanism of methanogenesis change in the paddy field sunder different elevated CO2 concentrations(e[CO2]) is rarely explored in earlier studies. In this research, we explored how the methanogens affect CH4 flux in paddy field sunder various (e[CO2]). CH4 flux and CH4 production potential (MPP), and mcrA gene abundance were quantitatively analyzed under C (ambient CO2 concentration), C-1 (C + 160 ppm CO2), and C-2 (C+ 200 ppm CO2) treatments. Additionally, the community composition and structure of methanogens were also compared with Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The results showed that C-2 treatment significantly increased CH4 flux and MPP at the tillering stage. E[CO2] had apositive effect on the abundance of methanogens, but the effect was insignificant. We detected four known dominant orders of methanogenesis in this study, such as Methanosarcinales, Methanobacteriales, Methanocellales, and Methanomicrobiales. Although e[CO2] did not significantly change the overall community structure and diversity of methanogens, C-2 treatment significantly reduced the relative abundance of two uncultured genera compared to C treatment. A linear regression model of DOC, methanogenic abundance, and MPP can explain 67.2% of the variation of CH4 flux undere[CO2]. Overall, our results demonstrated that CH4 flux in paddy fields undere [CO2] was mainly controlled by soil unstable C substrateand the abundance and activity of methanogens in rhizosphere soil.

TI  - Introduction of Panax notoginseng into pine forests significantly enhances the diversity, stochastic processes, and network complexity of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) have a pivotal impact on the nitrogen cycle within agroforestry systems. The organic management of the Panax notoginseng (sanqi)-Pinus armandii agroforestry (SPA) system resulted in nitrogen deficiency because of the lack of application of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, assessing the variability in NFB due to the cultivation of sanqi in the SPA system becomes crucial.Methods The seasonal dynamics in the abundance, diversity, and community structure of NFB in the soil of monocropping pine (MP) and SPA systems were assessed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and high-throughput sequencing technology.Results and discussion Sanqi cultivation triggered a decrease in the abundance of NFB but increased alpha diversity. Additionally, significant differences in the community structure of NFB were noted between the MP and SPA systems. Moreover, the abundance of Bradyrhizobium and Azospirillum increased in the soil after sanqi was cultivated. Furthermore, the cultivation of sanqi broadened the ecological niche breadth of NFB and increased the stochasticity in its community structure assembly (i.e., dispersal limitation). Additionally, the SPA system increased the network complexity but not the stability of NFB. The structural equation model (SEM) revealed that pH directly impacted the network complexity and stability of NFB in the SPA system. Sanqi cultivation positively influences the community characteristics of NFB in the soil in the SPA system. Our study provides new insights into nitrogen cycling and utilization in the SPA system.

TI  - Impact of nitrogen and phosphorus amendments on nitrogen-cycling microbial abundances and potentials: A meta-analysis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - The rapid increase in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availabilities in terrestrial ecosystems has led to sustained shifts in soil microbial communities and microbially-mediated N-cycling. However, the specific effects of N and P amendments on N-cycling microbes are poorly understood. This meta-analysis synthesizes the effects of N and/or P amendments on the abundances and functional potentials of N-cycling genes involved in N-2 fixation, organic N mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification across natural ecosystems and diverse soil conditions in China. Our findings indicate that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) showed greater responsiveness to N amendment than ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and AOB amoA abundance increased while AOA amoA abundance decreased with P amendments. Additionally, the abundance of nirS declined, while nirK abundance remained unresponsive to both N and P amendments. These findings highlight the distinct ecological niches occupied by microbial groups with equivalent functions in response to N and P amendments. Moreover, our findings indicate that soil N and P availabilities, along with soil acidification induced by N additions and microbial biomass carbon content, are key factors regulating N-cycling gene abundances and potentials. The driving mechanisms for N-cycling genes and their corresponding potentials appear to be distinct, with gene abundance showing only a limited influence on functional potentials. This suggests that factors such as soil properties and microbial community compositions may be more critical determinants of N-cycling processes than functional gene abundances with regard to scenarios of increasing N and P deposition.

TI  - Changes in substrate availability drive carbon cycle response to chronic warming
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - As earth's climate continues to warm, it is important to understand how the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to retain carbon (C) will be affected. We combined measurements of microbial activity with the concentration, quality, and physical accessibility of soil carbon to microorganisms to evaluate the mechanisms by which more than two decades of experimental warming has altered the carbon cycle in a Northeast US temperate deciduous forest. We found that concentrations of soil organic matter were reduced in both the organic and mineral soil horizons. The molecular composition of the carbon was altered in the mineral soil with significant reductions in the relative abundance of polysaccharides and lignin, and an increase in lipids. Mineral-associated organic matter was preferentially depleted by warming in the top 3 cm of mineral soil. We found that potential extracellular enzyme activity per gram of soil at a common temperature was generally unaffected by warming treatment. However, by measuring potential extracellular enzyme activities between 4 and 30 C, we found that activity per unit microbial biomass at in-situ temperatures was increased by warming. This was associated with a tendency for microbial biomass to decrease with warming. These results indicate that chronic warming has reduced soil organic matter concentrations, selecting for a smaller but more active microbial community increasingly dependent on mineral-associated organic matter.

TI  - Corpse decay of wild animals leads to the divergent succession of nrfA-type microbial communities
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Animal carcasses introduce large amounts of nitrates and ammonium into the soil ecosystem. Some of this ammonium is transformed from nitrite through the nrfA-type microbial community. However, it is unclear how nrfA-type microorganisms respond to the decomposition of corpses. This study applied high-throughput sequencing to characterize the ecological succession of nrfA-type microbial communities in grassland soil. Our results showed that Cyclobacterium and Trueperella were the predominant genera for nrfA-type communities in soil with a decomposing corpse (experimental group), while Cyclobacterium and Archangium were dominant in soil without a corpse (control group). The alpha diversity indexes and the resistance and resilience indexes of the microbial communities initially increased and then decreased during decomposition. Compared with the control group, nrfA-encoding community structure in the experimental group gradually became divergent with succession and temporal turnover accelerated. Network analysis revealed that the microbial communities of the experimental group had more complex interactions than those of the control groups. Moreover, the bacterial community assembly in the experimental group was governed by stochastic processes, and the communities of the experimental group had a weaker dispersal capacity than those of the control group. Our results reveal the succession patterns of the nrfA-type microbial communities during degradation of wild animal corpses, which can offer references for demonstrating the ecological mechanism underlying the changes in the nrfA-type microbial community during carcass decay.

TI  - The role of biocrusts in nitrogen cycling on the tropical reef islands, South China Sea
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
AB  - Harboring polyextremotolerant microbial topsoil communities, biological soil crusts (biocrusts) occur across various climatic zones, and have been well studied in the terrestrial drylands. However, little is known about the functional metabolic potential of microbial communities involved in the biogeochemical processes during the early succession of biocrusts on the tropical reef islands. We collected 26 biocrusts and bare soil samples from the Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands, and applied a functional gene array (GeoChip 5.0) to reveal nitrogen (N) cycling processes involved in these samples. Both physicochemical measurement and enzyme activity assay were utilized to characterize the soil properties. Results revealed the composition of N-cycling functional genes in biocrusts was distinct from that in bare soil. Additionally, microorganisms in biocrusts showed lower functional potential related to ammonification, denitrification, N assimilation, nitrification, N fixation, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium compared to bare soils. Although the abundance of nifH gene was lower in biocrusts, nitrogenase activity was significantly higher compared to that in bare soils. Precipitation, soil physicochemical properties (i.e., soil available copper, soil ammonia N and pH) and soil biological properties (i.e., beta-glucosidase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, alkaline protease, urease, alkaline phosphatase, catalase and chlorophyll a) correlated to the N-cycling functional genes structure. Nitrate N and ammonia N were more abundant in biocrusts than bare soil, while pH value was higher in bare soil. Our results suggested biocrusts play an important role in N-cycling in coral sand soil, and will be helpful in understanding the development and ecological functions of biocrusts on tropical reef islands.

TI  - DNA-SIP unveiled niche differentiation of active ammonia oxidizers in stratified sediments of the Three Gorges Reservoir
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB  - Comammox bacteria represent a newly discovered group of microorganisms capable of complete ammonia oxidation, playing a crucial role in the nitrogen cycle. Although the understanding of Comammox bacteria remains in its early stages, key aspects of their ecological roles and physiological status are still uncertain, especially regarding their distinction from other nitrifying microorganisms. To address these uncertainties, this study employed DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) to investigate depth-specific microbial communities in sediments and identify active ammonia-oxidizing populations along with their ecological niche differentiation. Results showed that net nitrification rates were significantly higher in the 0-10 cm sediment layer compared to the 10-30 cm layer. Across all depths, the abundance of the ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) gene exceeded that of comammox Nitrospira clade A (ComA) and ammoniaoxidizing bacteria (AOB) genes. During active nitrification, substantial 1 3C assimilation by AOA was detected in the 0-10 cm layer, whereas only a minor shift from light to heavy fractions was observed for ComA in the 10-20 cm layer. Phylogenetic analysis of heavy fraction DNA further revealed that Nitrososphaera gargensis dominated active AOA, while clade A.2 represented the active ComA population. These findings provide compelling evidence that both AOA and ComA contribute to nitrification in Three Gorges Reservoir sediments. Notably, the dominant active ammonia oxidizers shifted from AOA in surface layers to ComA at greater depths, highlighting a more significant functional role of sedimentary ComA than previously recognized. The niche differentiation of active ammonia oxidizers in stratified sediments played a critical role in shaping nitrogen cycling processes in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Acclimation of coastal wetland vegetation to salinization results in the asymmetric response of soil respiration along an experimental precipitation gradient
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Intensified interannual variability in precipitation is anticipated to alter soil salinization in coastal wetlands, which may significantly impact the structure and function of ecosystems, especially soil carbon cycling. However, the response patterns and mechanisms of soil respiration to precipitation changes in coastal wetlands remain uncertain. To assess the response pattern of soil respiration to altered precipitation, a field manipulation experiment with five precipitation treatments (-60%, -40%, +0%, +40%, and +60% of ambient precipitation) was conducted from 2015 to 2019 in a coastal wetland in the Yellow River Delta, China. Over five years, the responses of soil respiration along this experimental precipitation gradient were positive asymmetric, with a greater increase in soil respiration under wet treatments (by 24.3% and 27.7% under the +40% and +60% treatments, respectively) than reduction under dry treatments (by 10.3% and 4.0% under the -60% and -40% treatments, respectively). The observed positive asymmetric responses of soil respiration were associated with the decreased response of belowground biomass and leaf area index to high soil electric conductivity under decreased precipitation. Our study demonstrated that the acclimation of vegetation to salinization was a major determining factor in the asymmetric response of soil respiration along an experimental precipitation gradient in coastal wetlands. Our findings emphasize that soil salinity will play an essential role in regulating soil carbon cycles in coastal wetlands. The positive asymmetric response of soil respiration to altered precipitation indicates that the intensification of precipitation variability in the future may negatively affect the stability of the soil carbon stock.

TI  - Water content alters soil organic carbon metabolism via microbial traits in Tibetan alpine peatlands
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Alpine peatlands on the eastern Tibetan Plateau are vital carbon sinks, with soil moisture playing a key role in peatland carbon cycling. However, they face disruptions in their carbon balance due to drought, which reduces soil water content. Therefore, this study investigated microbially driven water-carbon interactions through field surveys, laboratory incubations, and metagenomics. Soil drying contributes to changes in both the metabolic quotient (qCO2) and the microbial quotient (Cmic: Corg), as well as the microbial abundance. As the soil water content decreased, both qCO2 and Cmic: Corg exhibited an overall increasing trend. Moreover, soil water content had a more significant effect on soil bacteria, while its effect on fungi and archaea was minimal. Soil microbial carbon decomposition genes were also influenced by changes in soil water content. Next, we used RDA to analyze the relationship between soil respiration quotient values and microbial traits. The results revealed that Actinobacteria were strongly negatively correlated with qCO2, whereas Archaea and Candidatus_R were positively correlated with qCO2. Additionally, Cmic: Corg was closely linked to fungi, and both Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria exhibited positive correlations. qCO2 had a strong negative correlation with genes involved in the degradation of monosaccharides and hemicellulose, whereas Cmic: Corg was positively correlated with genes related to the degradation of cellulose and lignin. Moreover, droughts affected microbial residue carbon and associated carbon metabolic pathways. Therefore, changes in soil water content may be an important factor influencing carbon metabolism processes in peatlands. This study deepens our understanding of the effects of drought on soil metabolism and microbial dynamics in alpine peatlands and provides new insights into the microecological mechanisms of soil carbon cycling in these ecosystems in the context of global change.

TI  - Micro fluidic qPCR Enables High Throughput Quantification of Microbial Functional Genes but Requires Strict Curation of Primers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Quantification of microbial functional genes enhances predictions of soil biogeochemical process rates, but reliance on low-throughput quantitative PCR (qPCR) limits the scope of ecological studies to a handful of targets. Here, we explore whether microfluidic qPCR (MFQPCR) is a viable high-throughput alternative for functional gene quantification, by evaluating the efficiency, specificity and sensitivity of 29 established and 12 newly designed primer pairs targeting taxonomic, nitrogen-cycling, and hydrocarbon degradation genes in genomic DNA soil extracts, under three different sets of MFQPCR assay conditions. Without curation, commonly-used qPCR primer pairs yielded an extreme range of reaction efficiencies (25.9-100.1%), but when conditions were optimized, MFQPCR produced copy-number estimates comparable to traditional qPCR. To guide microbial soil ecologists considering adoption of MFQPCR, we present suggestions for primer selection, including omission of inosines, degeneracy scores of < 9, amplicon sizes of <= 211 bp, and GC content of 32-61%. We conclude that, while the nanoliter reaction volumes, rapid thermocycling and one-size-fits-all reaction conditions of MFQPCR necessitates more stringent primer selection criteria than is commonly applied in soil microbial ecology, the ability to quantify up to 96 targets in 96 samples makes MFQPCR a valuable tool for monitoring shifts in functional community abundances. MFQPCR will particularly suit studies targeting multiple clade-specific functional genes, or when primer design is informed by previous knowledge of the environment.

TI  - Mechanisms of phosphorus activation in charosphere and non-charosphere: The priming effect of biochar
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Biochar is widely used in soil to increase the soil phosphorus content, but a special ecological zone called the "charosphere" zone is formed where biochar comes into contact with soil. The physical and chemical properties of charosphere soil are different from those of the original soil and the biochar itself, leading to uncertainty regarding the effect of charosphere soil on the phosphorus cycle. Hence, we designed a barrier device to separate biochar from soil and analyzed the impact of biochar diffusion on soil nutrient content and microbial activity. Then, the variation characteristics of the community structure of phoD-harboring bacteria and fungi in the carbonosphere (group B) and non-carbonosphere (group C) were explored. Finally, the key factors and potential driving mechanisms of soil phosphorus activation were explored. The results show that biochar improved soil microbial activity and stimulated the soil nutrient recycling, resulting in a 67.28 % greater percentage of the labile P fraction in group B than in group C. The alpha diversity and nutrient transfer efficiency of the phoDharboring bacterial community in group B were greater than those in group C, while the phoD-harboring bacterial co-occurrence network of group C was more complex. Moreover, the synergy between the co-occurrence networks of the soil fungal community was stronger than that of the bacterial community. Biochar stimulates microbial activation of phosphorus by increasing the DOC content and pH in the charosphere, and the phoDharboring bacterial community dominates soil phosphorus activation. These findings offer a new perspective on how biochar regulates soil phosphorus cycling, providing crucial information to guide the application of biochar in agroecosystems.

TI  - Nutrient addition and warming alter the soil phosphorus cycle in grasslands: A global meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - Purpose Grasslands are the most extensive vegetation type in the terrestrial ecosystem and have an important role in the soil phosphorus (P) cycle. Many nutrient addition and warming experiments have been conducted in grasslands; however, the global pattern of nutrient addition and experimental warming impacts on soil P cycle is unclear. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of 68 publications to synthesize the mechanisms underlying global grassland ecosystem responses to nutrient addition and experimental warming. Results Our analysis indicated that nitrogen (N) addition reduced microbial biomass P (- 11.2%) but increased litter P concentration (+ 15.5%) and available P (+ 14.2%). Experimental warming reduced microbial biomass P (- 10.5%) and available P (- 6.7%) but increased litter P concentration (+ 46.2%). P addition increased available P (+ 222.3%) and microbial biomass P (+ 98.1%). The available P response to nutrient addition and experimental warming was more sensitive in temperate grasslands than in alpine grasslands. The responses of soil total and available P to nutrient addition depended on environmental conditions such as air temperature and soil pH. Conclusion Our results suggest that N addition may promote P mineralization and possibly stimulate the transformation of refractory or resistant forms of soil inorganic P, whereas experimental warming accelerates the P cycle by regulating plant acquisition and enzyme activity. Environmental factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation, pH) affect the soil P response to nutrient addition by altering microbial and enzymatic activities. It is crucial to understand the dynamic changes in soil microbial and enzyme activities to predict the P cycle in grassland soils in the future.

TI  - Understory plant removal counteracts tree thinning effect on soil respiration in a temperate forest
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Elucidating the response mechanism of soil respiration (Rs) to silvicultural practices is pivotal to evaluating the effects of management practices on soil carbon cycling in planted forest ecosystems. However, as common management practices, how thinning, understory plant removal, and their interactions affect Rs and its autotrophic and heterotrophic components (Ra and Rh) remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated Rs, Ra and Rh by the trenching method from 2011 to 2015 in a Pinus tabuliformis plantation in northern China, subjecting to four treatments (intact control plots [CK], thinning [T], understory removal [UR], and thinning with understory removal [TUR]). Mean annual Rs was significantly increased by thinning (by 15.3%), whereas decreased by UR (by 17.4%), compared with CK. These variations in Rs were mainly attributed to changes in Ra. The increments of Ra were caused by the enhanced growth of fine root biomass after thinning. However, UR led to lower Ra compared with CK (p < .05), indicating that understory growth is inadequate to compensate for the decreased respiring root biomass induced by understory removal. Rs was unchanged between TUR and the intact control plot due to the opposite effects of thinning and UR on the Ra. Changes in Rh exhibited no significant differences among the treatments, partly because of the stable microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and forest floor mass (litter and fine woody debris). No interaction effect between thinning and understory removal was detected on Rs, Ra, and Rh. The lowest temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) value of Ra was found in CK. This study highlights the necessity of incorporating understory plant effects on soil CO2 efflux in assessing forest management practices on soil carbon cycling.

TI  - Particle size rather than concentration of silver nanoparticles mainly affects soil N2-fixing bacterial communities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities are essential for nitrogen cycling. Large amounts of silver nanoparticles released into the environment (especially farmlands) can dramatically affect soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities. Thus, high-throughput sequencing technology was implemented to address the ecotoxicological effects of silver nanoparticles with different particle sizes and concentrations on soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities in the wheat rhizosphere. Soil pH value is inversely related to the diversity of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities likely mediated by the changes in nutrient availability in the soil subsystems. AgNPs. Silver nanoparticles with 30 nm significantly decrease the diversity of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities compared with the control. The decreased diversity of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities can reduce the soil nitrogen availability for wheat via the decreased nifH gene abundance. Treatments with silver nanoparticles and silver ions significantly increase soil silver ion concentration compared with the control. Thus, the inhibition of silver nanoparticles on soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities is presumably due to the released silver ions. Silver ions pose a stronger inhibition on the diversity and richness of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities compared with silver nanoparticles. The inhibition of silver nanoparticles on the diversity and richness of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities increases as the particle size decreases. The concentration of silver nanoparticles does not exert notable effects on the alpha and beta diversity of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities. Accordingly, particle size, rather than concentration, is the most important determinant of the inhibition of silver nanoparticles on soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities.

TI  - Nanoparticle treatment of maize analyzed through the metatranscriptome: compromised nitrogen cycling, possible phytopathogen selection, and plant hormesis
T2  - MICROBIOME
AB  - Background The beneficial use of nanoparticle silver or nanosilver may be confounded when its potent antimicrobial properties impact non-target members of natural microbiomes such as those present in soil or the plant rhizosphere. Agricultural soils are a likely sink for nanosilver due to its presence in agrochemicals and land-applied biosolids, but a complete assessment of nanosilver's effects on this environment is lacking because the impact on the natural soil microbiome is not known. In a study assessing the use of nanosilver for phytopathogen control with maize, we analyzed the metatranscriptome of the maize rhizosphere and observed multiple unintended effects of exposure to 100 mg kg(-1)nanosilver in soil during a growth period of 117 days.
   Results We found several unintended effects of nanosilver which could interfere with agricultural systems in the long term. Firstly, the archaea community was negatively impacted with a more than 30% decrease in relative abundance, and as such, their involvement in nitrogen cycling and specifically, nitrification, was compromised. Secondly, certain potentially phytopathogenic fungal groups showed significantly increased abundances, possibly due to the negative effects of nanosilver on bacteria exerting natural biocontrol against these fungi as indicated by negative interactions in a network analysis. Up to 5-fold increases in relative abundance have been observed for certain possibly phytopathogenic fungal genera. Lastly, nanosilver exposure also caused a direct physiological impact on maize as illustrated by increased transcript abundance of aquaporin and phytohormone genes, overall resulting in a stress level with the potential to yield hormetically stimulated plant root growth.
   Conclusions This study indicates the occurrence of significant unintended effects of nanosilver use on corn, which could turn out to be negative to crop productivity and ecosystem health in the long term. We therefore highlight the need to include the microbiome when assessing the risk associated with nano-enabled agriculture.

TI  - Enhanced plant growth in the presence of earthworms correlates with changes in soil microbiota but not nutrient availability
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Earthworms enhance plant growth but the precise mechanism by which this occurs is not known. An under-standing of the mechanism could potentially support changes in agricultural management reducing fertiliser usage and therefore costs and the carbon footprint of agriculture. We conducted a factorial experiment in which 5 strains of wheat were grown in the presence and absence of earthworms under regular watering and droughted conditions. The different wheat strains all responded in a similar fashion. Plant biomass was greater in the presence of earthworms and under regular watering. The presence of earthworms reduced the impact of drought on plant biomass and also slowed down the rate of drying of the droughted soils. Plant nutrient content (N, P, Si) showed no consistent pattern with treatments but plant total N, P and Si mirrored plant biomass and decreased in the order earthworm-present watered > earthworm-present droughted > earthworm-absent watered > earth-worm-absent droughted. Nutrient availability in the soil, as assessed by chemical extractions showed no consistent pattern with treatments. Differential gene expression of plants was greater between watering treat-ments than between earthworm treatments. Genes that were differentially expressed between the earthworm treatments predominantly related to plant defences, abiotic stress and control of plant growth though a couple were linked to both nitrogen cycling and stress responses. The soil microbiome of the earthworm-present treatments was more associated with nutrient-rich environments, the promotion of plant growth and the sup-pression of plant pathogens whilst that of the earthworm-absent treatments included a variety of plant patho-gens. Our data are consistent with enhanced plant growth being due to changes in the microbiome brought about by earthworm processing of the soil rather than changes in nutrient availability directly due to earthworm activity.

TI  - Effects of exotic earthworms on soil phosphorus cycling in two broadleaf temperate forests
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - We compared the biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus (P) in northern hardwood forest plots invaded by exotic earthworms versus adjacent uninvaded reference plots. in three of the six pairs of plots, earthworm invasion resulted in significantly more total P in the upper 12 cm of soil. The finding of increased amounts of unavailable and occluded inorganic P forms in the invaded plots suggests that earthworm activity mobilized unweathered soil particles from deeper layers of the soil, increasing the stocks of total P in surface soils. In two pairs of plots, the earthworm-invaded soils had less total P than the reference soils. In these plots, earthworm activity resulted in augmented rates of P cycling and alteration of the physical structure of the soil that increased loss of P in leaching water, reducing the total amount of P. We hypothesize that the different effects of earthworm invasion on the soil P cycle result from unique characteristics of the ecological groups of earthworms dominating each site. The invaded plots with increased total P were dominated by the anecic species Lumbricus terrestris, a large earthworm that constructs deep, vertical burrows and is effective at moving soil materials from and to deeper layers of the profile. in contrast, the earthworm-invaded plots where the total P in the surface soil decreased were dominated by the epiendogeic species L. rubellus, which feeds and lives in the upper organic layers of the soil. In these plots, earthworms significantly increased the amount of readily exchangeable P in the soil, increasing the loss of this element in leaching water.

TI  - Microbial-mediated redistribution of ecosystem nitrogen cycling can delay progressive nitrogen limitation
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) availability constrains future predictions of ecosystem primary productivity and carbon storage. The progressive N limitation (PNL) hypothesis predicts that forest net primary productivity (NPP) will decline with age, and that the response of NPP to elevated CO2 will attenuate through time due to negative feedbacks of NPP on the soil N cycle. A central assumption of the PNL hypothesis is that, without changes in exogenous exchange of N in an ecosystem, increases in plant N uptake require increased soil N cycling rates. However, at ecosystem scale, microbial N uptake exceeds plant uptake. Hence, a change in the partitioning of N between plants and soil microorganisms may represent an alternative mechanism to sustain plant N uptake in the face of PNL. To estimate N partitioning of total N cycling between plants and microbes, we measured and modeled growth and N uptake of trees, bacteria, saprotrophic fungi, and ectomycorrhizal fungi across a forest succession and N limitation gradient. The combined plant and ectomycorrhizal N uptake increased from early to late succession, and nearly matched saprotrophic N uptake in late successional sites, while total N cycling remained stable or even declined. Changes in microbial community structure can thus mediate a redistribution of ecosystem nitrogen cycling, allowing an increase in plant N uptake without concomitant increases in soil N cycling. We further suggest that microbe-mediated changes in N partitioning can delay PNL and may thereby act as a mechanism to extend the duration of the land carbon sink in response to rising atmospheric CO2.

TI  - Quantifying soil nitrous oxide emissions in spring freezing-thawing period over different vegetation types in Northeast China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB  - Environmental changes significantly alter the structure, diversity and activity of soil microbial communities during spring freezing-thawing period, leading to changes in the soil microbial nitrogen cycle. Changes in N2O fluxes after land use conversion from primary forest to secondary forest, Korean pine plantation and cropland in northeast China have not been quantified. Field experiments were conducted to measure soil N2O fluxes in a primary forest, two secondary forests, a Korean pine plantation, and one maize field in a temperate region in northeast China from 2017-03-06 to 2017-05-28. During the experimental period, the soil was exclusively a nitrogen source for all land uses. We found that N2O emissions ranged from 15.63 to 68.74 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and cumulative N2O emissions ranged from 0.33 to 2.10 kg ha(-1) during the period. Cumulative (NO)-O-2 emissions from the maize field were significantly higher than that from primary forest, Korean pine plantation, hardwood forest, and Betula platyphylla forest by 262.1% to 536.4%. Compared with other ecosystems in similar studies, the N2O emission rates of all ecosystem types in this study were low during the spring thaw period. Stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that there were significant correlations between N2O emissions and environmental factors (air temperature and soil temperature, soil water content, soil pH, NH4+-N, NO3--N, and soil organic carbon). The results showed that conversion of land use from primary forest to hardwood forest, Korean pine plantation or maize field greatly increased soil N2O emissions during spring freezing-thawing period, and N2O emissions from primary forest were almost the same as those from Betula platyphylla forest.

TI  - A 3-Year In-Situ Measurement of CO2Efflux in Coastal Wetlands: Understanding Carbon Loss through Ecosystem Respiration and its Partitioning
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - Understanding the link between ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and its influential factors is necessary to evaluate the sources of gaseous carbon loss in coastal wetlands. Seablite (Suaeda salsaPall.) is the main vegetation type pioneering temperate coastal wetlands in northeast China, and is generally an understudied wetland type. To evaluate the influence of environmental factors onR(eco), a multi-year in-situ experiment was carried out during the growing seasons of 2012 to 2014. Total CO(2)efflux was measured and separated further into soil microbial and belowground root respiration (Rs + r) and plant respiration (R-plant).R(eco)displayed strong seasonal variation, with effluxes as high as 845 to 1150 mg CO(2)m(-2) h(-1)during summer months and as low as 32 to 111 mg CO(2)m(-2) h(-1)during spring (when new shoots are sprouting) and fall (when plants are senescing) months. Aboveground plant structures contributed on average 79% to total plant biomass, and accounted for most of theR(eco)measured; i.e., 62-96% was associated asR(plant). Plant activity was strongly seasonal, accordingly drivingR(eco), with 1 g of soil-emergentS. salsabiomass (dry weight) producing approximately 1.58 mg CO(2)per hour towardR(eco)during mid-summer. When water level was below the soil surface,R(s + r)was exponentially correlated to air temperature. BecauseR(eco)forS. salsamarsh in the Liaohe Delta is controlled by plant growth cycles, inundation regime, and air temperature, this finding may be applied for national carbon budget estimation purposes fromS. salsawetlands throughout Northeast China and potentially close a key gap in understanding the role of this large wetland area in contributing to respiratory CO(2)emissions globally.

TI  - Biogeographic variation in temperature sensitivity of decomposition in forest soils
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Determining soil carbon (C) responses to rising temperature is critical for projections of the feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems, C cycle, and climate change. However, the direction and magnitude of this feedback remain highly uncertain due largely to our limited understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of soil C decomposition and its temperature sensitivity. Here we quantified C decomposition and its response to temperature change with an incubation study of soils from 203 sites across tropical to boreal forests in China spanning a wide range of latitudes (18 degrees 16 ' to 51 degrees 37 ' N) and longitudes (81 degrees 01 ' to 129 degrees 28 ' E). Mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation primarily explained the biogeographic variation in the decomposition rate and temperature sensitivity of soils: soil C decomposition rate decreased from warm and wet forests to cold and dry forests, while Q(10-MAT) (standardized to the MAT of each site) values displayed the opposite pattern. In contrast, biological factors (i.e. plant productivity and soil bacterial diversity) and soil factors (e.g. clay, pH, and C availability of microbial biomass C and dissolved organic C) played relatively small roles in the biogeographic patterns. Moreover, no significant relationship was found between Q(10-MAT) and soil C quality, challenging the current C quality-temperature hypothesis. Using a single, fixed Q(10-MAT) value (the mean across all forests), as is usually done in model predictions, would bias the estimated soil CO2 emissions at a temperature increase of 3.0 degrees C. This would lead to overestimation of emissions in warm biomes, underestimation in cold biomes, and likely significant overestimation of overall C release from soil to the atmosphere. Our results highlight that climate-related biogeographic variation in soil C responses to temperature needs to be included in next-generation C cycle models to improve predictions of C-climate feedbacks.

TI  - Increase in ammonia-oxidizing microbe abundance during degradation of alpine meadows may lead to greater soil nitrogen loss
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Alpine meadows on the Tibetan Plateau have experienced severe degradation in recent decades. Although the effects of alpine meadow degradation on soil properties have been well documented, there is still a paucity of knowledge regarding the responses of nitrogen-cycling microbes (NCMs) to degradation and their links to the changes in soil properties. Here, we systematically determined the effects of degraded patch formation on soil properties (i.e., total carbon, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, available phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, moisture, delta N-15, delta C-13, and pH) and NCMs (based on nifH, amoA, narG, nirK, and nirS genes and their transcripts) across three Tibetan alpine meadows at different degradation stages. Results showed that compared to the original grassed patches, the contents of most soil nutrients (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) were significantly decreased in the degraded patches across the study sites. Degraded patches also tended to have higher soil delta N-15 values and nitrate contents. Among the aforementioned NCMs, soil diazotrophs and denitrifiers only showed weak responses to the patch formation, while ammonia-oxidizing microbes showed the highest consistency and sensitivity in response to the patch formation across the study sites. The abundance of amoA gene and archaeal amoA mRNA significantly increased in the degraded patches, and they were positively correlated with soil delta N-15 values and nitrate nitrogen contents, but negatively correlated with soil total nitrogen and inorganic nitrogen contents. These results suggest that the increased ammonia-oxidizing microbial abundance may be an important driver of soil nitrogen loss during degraded patch formation in alpine meadows.

TI  - Taxonomical and functional bacterial community selection in the rhizosphere of the rice genotypes with different nitrogen use efficiencies
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - As the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer has caused series of environmental problems, improving the nitrogen use efficiency of rice crop has been drawing much attention. Since developing nitrogen-efficient rice genotypes is a feasible solution, illustrating the microbiological characteristics of the nitrogen-efficient rice genotypes is of great importance. We performed a field experiment, and planted 16 genotypes of rice. The nitrogen utilization efficiencies and yields of rice were examined. Real-time PCR and Illumina sequencing were employed to investigate the abundance of the nitrogen-cycle related genes and the bacterial community structure of the rhizosphere. The results revealed that rice genotypes enriched specific bacterial communities to inhabit in the rhizosphere at both the taxonomic and functional levels. The enriched bacteria were mainly involved in the functions of nitrogen transformation, ferric iron reduction, organic compound biodegradation, and sulfur transformation. We observed a strong correlation between the yield and the abundance of rhizospheric functional bacteria, especially the groups of Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi. The analysis of nitrite reductase and denitrifying genes showed that the denitrification activity in the rhizosphere inversely correlate with the efficiency of nitrogen utilization. We reason that a smaller denitrifying bacteria population leads to less the nitrogen loss in the rhizosphere, thus an increase of available nitrogen and a higher rice yield. This research revealed how functional bacteria assembled in the rhizosphere of rice genotypes with varied nitrogen use efficiencies, which may provide valuable information with regard to the improvement of nitrogen use efficiency and reduction of fertilizer application.

TI  - The role of legume roots in carbon sequestration, soil health enhancement, and salinity mitigation under climate change: A comprehensive review
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Legumes play a crucial role in sustainable agriculture by enhancing soil health, nitrogen cycling, carbon sequestration, and salinity mitigation, particularly in the face of climate change. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how legume roots and associated microbial interactions contribute to these processes. The deeprooting systems of legumes stabilize soil structure while increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions by up to 29.6 %. Through biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), legumes reduce reliance on synthetic fertilizers by up to 40 %, improving soil fertility and resilience. Additionally, legume cropping systems promote beneficial rhizobacterial communities, enhancing microbial nitrogen transformations. Meta-analyses reveal that intercropping legumes with non-legumes can significantly improve soil nutrient availability, microbial biomass, and overall crop yield while mitigating nitrogen losses. Furthermore, certain legume species thrive in saline soils, reducing soil salinity by up to 9.6 % and improving structure via organic matter accumulation and root-microbe interactions. Case studies across various agroecosystems highlight the real-world applications of legume-based strategies, showing measurable improvements in soil carbon storage, nitrogen cycling efficiency, and salinity reduction. These findings underscore the importance of site-specific legume management practices to maximize benefits under diverse environmental conditions. Future research should refine legume species selection, intercropping strategies, and biochar applications to enhance soil resilience and sustainability in a changing climate. This review provides a data-driven understanding of the multifaceted roles of legumes, offering insights into their potential as key components of climate-smart agriculture.

TI  - Microbial community and soil enzyme activities driving microbial metabolic efficiency patterns in riparian soils of the Three Gorges Reservoir
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Riparian zones represent important transitional areas between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Microbial metabolic efficiency and soil enzyme activities are important indicators of carbon cycling in the riparian zones. However, how soil properties and microbial communities regulate the microbial metabolic efficiency in these critical zones remains unclear. Thus, microbial taxa, enzyme activities, and metabolic efficiency were conducted in the riparian zones of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR). Microbial carbon use efficiency and microbial biomass carbon had a significant increasing trend along the TGR (from upstream to downstream); indicating higher carbon stock in the downstream, microbial metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) showed the opposite trend. Microbial community and co-occurrence network analysis revealed that although bacterial and fungal communities showed significant differences in composition, this phenomenon was not found in the number of major modules. Soil enzyme activities were significant predictors of microbial metabolic efficiency along the different riparian zones of the TGR and were significantly influenced by microbial a-diversity. The bacterial taxa Desulfobacterota, Nitrospirota and the fungal taxa Calcarisporiellomycota, Rozellomycota showed a significant positive correlation with qCO(2). The shifts in key microbial taxa unclassified_k_Fungi in the fungi module #3 are highlighted as essential factors regulating the microbial metabolic efficiency. Structural equation modeling results also revealed that soil enzyme activities had a highly significant negative effect on microbial metabolism efficiency (bacteria, path coefficient = -0.63; fungi, path coefficient = -0.67).This work has an important impact on the prediction of carbon cycling in aquatic-terrestrial ecotones.Graphical abstract

TI  - Unraveling the toxic effects of iron oxide nanoparticles on nitrogen cycling through manure-soil-plant continuum
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Soil contamination with metallic nanoparticles is increasing due to their increased use in industrial and domestic settings. These nanoparticles are potentially toxic to soil microbes and may affect their associated functions and thereby the nutrient cycling in agro-ecosystems. This study examined the effects of iron oxides nanoparticles (IONPs) on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics of poultry (PM) and farmyard manure (FYM) in the soil. The application of IONPs increased iron content in soil microbial biomass, which reflected its consumption by the microbes. As a result, colony-forming units of bacteria and fungi reduced considerably. Such observations lead to a decrease in CO2 emission from PM and FYM by 27 and 28%, respectively. The respective decrease fractions in the case of N mineralization were 24 and 35%. Consequently, soil mineral N content was reduced by 16% from PM and 12% from FYM as compared to their sole application without IONPs. Spinach dry matter yield and apparent N recovery were increased by the use of organic waste (FYM, PM). The use of IONPs significantly reduced the plant N recovery fraction by 26 and 24% (P < 0.05) from PM and FYM, respectively. All the results mentioned above lead us to conclude that IONPs are toxic to soil microbes and affect their function i.e., carbon and N mineralization of applied manure, and thereby the on-farm N cycling from the manure-soil-plant continuum.

TI  - Observation-based global soil heterotrophic respiration indicates underestimated turnover and sequestration of soil carbon by terrestrial ecosystem models
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil heterotrophic respiration (R-h) refers to the flux of CO2 released from soil to atmosphere as a result of organic matter decomposition by soil microbes and fauna. As one of the major fluxes in the global carbon cycle, large uncertainties still exist in the estimation of global R-h, which further limits our current understanding of carbon accumulation in soils. Here, we applied a Random Forest algorithm to create a global data set of soil R-h, by linking 761 field observations with both abiotic and biotic predictors. We estimated that global R-h was 48.8 +/- 0.9 Pg C year(-1) for 1982-2018, which was 16% less than the ensemble mean (58.6 +/- 9.9 Pg C year(-1)) of 16 terrestrial ecosystem models. By integrating our observational R-h with independent soil carbon stock data sets, we obtained a global mean soil carbon turnover time of 38.3 +/- 11 year. Using observation-based turnover times as a constraint, we found that terrestrial ecosystem models simulated faster carbon turnovers, leading to a 30% (74 Pg C) underestimation of terrestrial ecosystem carbon accumulation for the past century, which was especially pronounced at high latitudes. This underestimation is equivalent to 45% of the total carbon emissions (164 Pg C) caused by global land-use change at the same time. Our analyses highlight the need to constrain ecosystem models using observation-based and locally adapted R-h values to obtain reliable projections of the carbon sink capacity of terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Global magnitude of rhizosphere effects on soil microbial communities and carbon cycling in natural terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The rhizosphere is one of the most dynamic interfaces on the Earth. Understanding the magnitudes of rhizosphere ef-fects (RE, difference in bio-physicochemical properties between rhizosphere and bulk soils) on soil microbial commu-nities and their moderators is important for studying on below-ground carbon (C) cycling. A comprehensive meta -analysis was conducted to quantify the REs on soil microbial biomass, community structure, respiration, and C -degrading enzymes. We found that REs on soil C and nutrients, total microbial biomass, the abundance of specific microbial groups, fungi to bacteria ratio, respiration, and C-degrading enzymes were positive, but the magnitudes were varied with biomes, plant functional types, and mycorrhizal types. REs on microbial biomass, respiration, and C-degrading enzymes increased with the increase of mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, but decreased with the increase of soil clay, C, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) contents. The REs on microbial biomass and respiration also increased as the REs on soil C:N:P increased. Compared with bulk soil, per unit rhizosphere soil C supported more microbial biomass, per unit of which respired more C, leading to faster C decomposition in rhizo-sphere. Our findings indicate that the increase in microbial biomass, co-metabolism induced by labile and energy -rich organic C of root exudates, and overflow respiration induced by stoichiometric imbalance together contribute to the enhanced C decomposition in rhizosphere. The global pattern of REs on soil microbial communities is critical to revealing the plant-microbe-soil interactions in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Assimilation of multiple data sets with the ensemble Kalman filter to improve forecasts of forest carbon dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been used in weather forecasting to assimilate observations into weather models. In this study, we examine how effectively forecasts of a forest carbon cycle can be improved by assimilating observations with the EnKF. We used the EnKF to assimilate into the terrestrial ecosystem (TECO) model eight data sets collected at the Duke Forest between 1996 and 2004 (foliage biomass, fine root biomass, woody biomass, litterfall, microbial biomass, forest floor carbon, soil carbon, and soil respiration). We then used the trained model to forecast changes in carbon pools from 2004 to 2012. Our daily analysis of parameters indicated that all the exit rates were well constrained by the EnKF, with the exception of the exit rates controlling the loss of metabolic litter and passive soil organic matter. The poor constraint of these two parameters resulted from the low sensitivity of TECO predictions to their values and the poor correlation between these parameters and the observed variables. Using the estimated parameters, the model predictions and observations were in agreement. Model forecasts indicate 15 380-15 660 g C/m(2) stored in Duke Forest by 2012 (a 27% increase since 2004). Parameter uncertainties decreased as data were sequentially assimilated into the model using the EnKF. Uncertainties in forecast carbon sinks increased over time for the long-term carbon pools (woody biomass, structure litter, slow and passive SOM) but remained constant over time for the short-term carbon pools (foliage, fine root, metabolic litter, and microbial carbon). Overall, EnKF can effectively assimilate multiple data sets into an ecosystem model to constrain parameters, forecast dynamics of state variables, and evaluate uncertainty.

TI  - Comparing the impacts of an invasive grass on nitrogen cycling and ammonia-oxidizing prokaryotes in high-nitrogen forests, open fields, and wetlands
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims Numerous invasive plant species can increase soil nitrate (NO3-) by altering the nitrification process through plant-soil microbe interactions with ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). We evaluated how the invasive species Microstegium vimineum influenced physico-chemical soil properties, inorganic nitrogen (N) cycling, and AOA and AOB abundances under various environmental conditions. Methods We paired 75 M. vimineum-invaded plots with 75 neighboring reference plots across forests, open fields, and forested wetlands within a state park in the Mid-Atlantic United States that has received high levels of N deposition. Soils were sampled for physico-chemical properties, NO3- and ammonium (NH4+) pools and availability, and AOA and AOB abundances. Results There were multiple soil impacts associated with M. vimineum across all ecosystems, most consistent were increased soil pH and increased NO3- pools. For other impacts, the directionality and effect sizes varied among ecosystems (e.g. NH4+ pools were 34% lower in forests, 35% lower in open fields, and 90% higher in wetlands relative to reference plots). Finally, forests had nearly all of impacts predicted by a pH-mediated nitrification plant-soil feedback. Conclusion This study highlights the ability of an invasive grass to alter N cycling and soil properties in forests, open fields, and wetlands that have received high N deposition. We also show how invader-mediated impacts to N cycling may be dependent on the context of the ecosystem being invaded, including its hydrology, ambient soil conditions, and substrate-availability.

TI  - Exploring the Role of Cryptic Nitrogen Fixers in Terrestrial Ecosystems: A Frontier in Nitrogen Cycling Research
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation represents the largest natural flux of new nitrogen (N) into terrestrial ecosystems, providing a critical N source to support net primary productivity of both natural and agricultural systems. When they are common, symbiotic associations between plants and bacteria can add more than 100 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) to ecosystems. Yet, these associations are uncommon in many terrestrial ecosystems. In most cases, N inputs derive from more cryptic sources, including mutualistic and/or free-living microorganisms in soil, plant litter, decomposing roots and wood, lichens, insects, and mosses, among others. Unfortunately, large gaps remain in the understanding of cryptic N fixation. We conducted a literature review to explore rates, patterns, and controls of cryptic N fixation in both unmanaged and agricultural ecosystems. Our analysis indicates that, as is common with N fixation, rates are highly variable across most cryptic niches, with N inputs in any particular cryptic niche ranging from near zero to more than 20 kg ha(-1) y(-1). Such large variation underscores the need for more comprehensive measurements of N fixation by organisms not in symbiotic relationships with vascular plants in terrestrial ecosystems, as well as identifying the factors that govern cryptic N fixation rates. We highlight several challenges, opportunities, and priorities in this important research area, and we propose a conceptual model that posits an interacting hierarchy of biophysical and biogeochemical controls over N fixation that should generate valuable new hypotheses and research.

TI  - Salt tolerance-based niche differentiation of soil ammonia oxidizers
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Ammonia oxidizers are key players in the global nitrogen cycle, yet little is known about their ecological performances and adaptation strategies for growth in saline terrestrial ecosystems. This study combined C-13-DNA stable-isotope probing (SIP) microcosms with amplicon and shotgun sequencing to reveal the composition and genomic adaptations of active ammonia oxidizers in a saline-sodic (solonetz) soil with high salinity and pH (20.9 cmol(c) exchangeable Na+ kg(-1) soil and pH 9.64). Both ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) exhibited strong nitrification activities, although AOB performed most of the ammonia oxidation observed in the solonetz soil and in the farmland soil converted from solonetz soil. Members of the Nitrosococcus, which are more often associated with aquatic habitats, were identified as the dominant ammonia oxidizers in the solonetz soil with the first direct labeling evidence, while members of the Nitrosospira were the dominant ammonia oxidizers in the farmland soil, which had much lower salinity and pH. Metagenomic analysis of "Candidatus Nitrosococcus sp. Sol14", a new species within the Nitrosococcus lineage, revealed multiple genomic adaptations predicted to facilitate osmotic and pH homeostasis in this extreme habitat, including direct Na+ extrusion/H+ import and the ability to increase intracellular osmotic pressure by accumulating compatible solutes. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that variation in salt-tolerance mechanisms was the primary driver for the niche differentiation of ammonia oxidizers in saline-sodic soils. These results demonstrate how ammonia oxidizers can adapt to saline-sodic soil with excessive Na+ content and provide new insights on the nitrogen cycle in extreme terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Ectomycorrhizal fungi are associated with reduced nitrogen cycling rates in temperate forest soils without corresponding trends in bacterial functional groups
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Microbial processes play a central role in controlling the availability of N in temperate forests. While bacteria, archaea, and fungi account for major inputs, transformations, and exports of N in soil, relationships between microbial community structure and N cycle fluxes have been difficult to detect and characterize. Several studies have reported differences in N cycling based on mycorrhizal type in temperate forests, but associated differences in N cycling genes underlying these fluxes are not well-understood. We explored how rates of soil N cycle fluxes vary across gradients of mycorrhizal abundance (hereafter "mycorrhizal gradients") at four temperate forest sites in Massachusetts and Indiana, USA. We paired measurements of N-fixation, net nitrification, and denitrification rates with gene abundance data for specific bacterial functional groups associated with each process. We find that the availability of NO3 and rates of N-fixation, net nitrification, and denitrification are reduced in stands dominated by trees associated with ECM fungi. On average, rates of N-fixation and denitrification in stands dominated by trees associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were more than double the corresponding rates in stands dominated by trees associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi. Despite the structuring of flux rates across the mycorrhizal gradients, we did not find concomitant shifts in the abundances of N-cycling bacterial genes, and gene abundances were not correlated with process rates. Given that AM-associating trees are replacing ECM-associating trees throughout much of the eastern US, our results suggest that shifts in mycorrhizal dominance may accelerate N cycling independent of changes in the relative abundance of N cycling bacteria, with consequences for forest productivity and N retention.

TI  - Invasion of downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) causes rapid changes in the nitrogen cycle
T2  - AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST
AB  - Invasion of exotic species threatens the stability of ecosystems and is regarded as a significant component of global ecological change. One of the most successful invasive species of the intermountain west of the United States is Bromus tectorum L. (downy brome)an annual Eurasian grass that was first observed in North America in the late 1800s in areas of Washington, Oregon and Utah and now covers ca. 40,000,000 ha. The prevalence of B. tectorum raises concerns regarding its potential effects on ecosystem structure and function. In this study we investigated the effects of invasion of B. tectorum on an ungrazed grassland in Canyonlands National Park, Utah. Because the invasion occurred on previously established study transects, we were able to assess the short-term effects of an invasion with a known entry date. We conducted long-term soil incubations in the laboratory to obtain data on cumulative nitrogen mineralization which was used to calculate the size of the labile pool of soil nitrogen. We also measured in situ soil inorganic nitrogen and net nitrogen mineralization. We found that, 2 y following the invasion of B. tectorum, the labile pool of soil nitrogen was 50% smaller for invaded sites compared to uninvaded sites. In addition, invaded sites had significantly reduced in situ inorganic nitrogen and net nitrogen mineralization compared to uninvaded sites. The mechanisms for these changes in soil nitrogen cycling and nitrogen availability may be related to differences in the phenology, litter composition and biomass of B. tectorum compared to native grass species. These findings suggest availability of key resources is dramatically influenced by invasion of B. tectorum at these sites.

TI  - Variance and main drivers of field nitrous oxide emissions: A global synthesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The precise estimation of global nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in nitrogen cycling will facilitate improved projections of future climate change. However, the geographical variations and the primary controlling factors of N2O emissions remain elusive at the global scale. What is lacking is their specific evaluation based on field data. We compiled a new dataset of soil N2O emission rates, including 6016 field observations from 219 articles, to synthesize N2O emission rates for different ecosystems and to explore the key determinants of N2O emission variations. The global mean soil N2O emission rate was 1111.8 +/- 26.6 mu g N m(-2) day(-1), with the largest one from humid subtropical regions and the smallest one from semi-arid areas. The soil N2O emission rates were positively correlated with the mean air annual temperature, soil pH, cation exchange capacity, soil moisture, soil organic carbon (C), total soil nitrogen (N), dissolved organic N, ammonium, nitrate, available phosphorus concentrations, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) at a global scale. Conversely, the soil N2O rates were negatively correlated with soil bulk density, C:N ratio, and MBC:MBN ratio. The results of structural equation models revealed that the joint direct effects of soil nitrate, ammonium, and total N (combined standard coefficient = 0.45) accounted for most of the variability in global soil N2O emissions (total standard coefficient = 0.84), while climate factors and other soil physicochemical properties accounted for less. This study highlights the critical roles of soil N substrates on N2O emissions, which will facilitate the optimization of process-models for soil N2O emissions.

TI  - The abundance and community structure of active ammonia-oxidizing archaea and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria shape their activities and contributions in coastal wetlands
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - Aerobic ammonia oxidation, an important part of the global nitrogen cycle, is thought to be jointly driven by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in coastal wetlands. However, the activities and contributions of AOA and AOB in coastal wetlands have remained largely unknown. Here, we investigated the oxidation capability of AOA and AOB in four types of typical coastal wetlands (paddy, estuary, shallow and reed wetland) in the Bohai region in China using DNA-based stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP), quantitative PCR and high -throughput sequencing techniques. We found that the community structure of AOB varied substantially, and the AOA structure was more stable across different coastal wetlands. The rate of AOA was 0.12, 0.84, 0.45 and 0.93 mu g N g(-1) soil d(-1) in paddy, estuary, shallow and reed wetlands, and the rate of AOB was 5.61,10.72, 0.74 and 1.16 mu g N g(-1) soil d(-1), respectively. We found that the contribution of AOA gradually increased from paddy to estuary to shallow wetland and finally to reed wetland, with values of 2.03%, 7.25%, 37.53% and 44.51%, respectively. Our results provide new insight into the mechanisms of the differences in activities and the contributions of AOA and AOB in different coastal wetlands, and our findings may contribute to further understanding of the global nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Quantitative Responses of Active Ammonia-Oxidizing Archaea and Bacteria to the Biological and Abiotic Factors Across Functional gene Distribution in Coastal Wetlands
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - The activities of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in the coastal wetlands play important roles in global nitrogen cycle. However, the driving factors of activities of AOA and AOB are still unclear. We collected 62 soil/sediment samples from coastal wetlands of the Bohai area of China to assess the potential activity of AOA (PAOA) and AOB (PAOB) using specific inhibitors. At last, we introduced the structural equation modeling (SEM) to infer direct and indirect effects of variables on potential activities. The results indicated that the change in AOA-amoA gene abundance may be more independent, while AOB-amoA was closely associated with the change in abundance of amx and denitrifier. PAOA was mainly defined by AOA-amoA abundance and partially influenced by the norA gene, suggesting coupling of archaeal ammonia oxidation with nitrite oxidation. PAOB was significantly defined by the abundance of amx and denitrifier, indirectly mediated by AOB-amoA. The activity of AOA seemed to be more independent of other microbial activities, while the activity of AOB varied closely with fluctuations of other microbial species. PAOA was mediated directly by the C/N ratio and indirectly by nitrite concentration and TOC value, while PAOB was mediated directly by ammonium concentration and TOC value and indirectly by C/N ratio. The activity of AOB may be determined by several other functional gene groups and had little correlation with AOB abundance while the activity of AOA was mostly controlled by itself.

TI  - Denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation reduces greenhouse gas emissions in floodplain sediments of the largest freshwater lake in China under flash drought
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Climate change-induced extreme heat, flooding and drought events influence the carbon and nitrogen cycling, including the denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) process which couples the nitrogen removal and methane (CH4) mitigation. To assess the impacts of 2022 record-breaking flash drought (summer FD) on the DAMO process, we collected bulk soils and Carex cinerascens-associated soils in the littoral wetlands of Poyang Lake during summer FD and winter drought. The in situ CH4 fluxes and potential DAMO rates were determined using static-chamber technique and 13C stable isotope method. The abundance, composition and metabolic pathways of DAMO archaeal and bacterial communities were investigated using quantitative PCR, high-throughput and metagenomic sequencing techniques. Higher DAMO rates (8.73 +/- 3.79 and 16.03 +/- 7.45 nmol 13co, g-1 d-1 for nitrate-DAMO and nitrite-DAMO respectively) were observed during summer FD compared to winter drought, and nitrite-DAMO (52%-74%) dominated the DAMO processes. DAMO bacterial pmoA genes (4.7 x 104-1.1 x 106 copies g-1 dry soil) were more abundant than DAMO archaeal mcrA genes (1.4 x 103-1.3 x 104 copies g-1 dry soil). Nitrate-and nitrite-DAMO rates were mainly driven by temperature, available nitrogen substrate and the abundance of DAMO archaea and bacteria, possibly contributing to CH4 consumption in the littoral wetlands of Poyang Lake. Several reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes possessing genes involved in anaerobic methane oxidation and nitrate/nitrite reduction could potentially participate in cooperative DAMO process. This study elucidates the DAMO process and microbial mechanisms under flash droughts, providing a novel insight for the carbon-nitrogen coupling and mitigation of greenhouse gases in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Winter bioaugmentation of co-contaminated soil: Differential effects in greenhouse and open-field settings on microbial communities
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - This study evaluated a winter bioaugmentation strategy using the psychrotolerant strain Microbacterium arborescens SMB19 to remediate antibiotic-heavy metal co-contaminated soils and examined its effects on microbial community functions under two contrasting environments: greenhouse warming (WTM) and open-field non-warming (CTM). Results showed that SMB19 effectively reduced antibiotic residues and bioavailable Zn concentrations. Under CTM, remediation was more effective, with higher antibiotic degradation rates and greater reductions in bioavailable metals. However, the abundance of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) increased. In contrast, under WTM, the synergistic effect between SMB19 and indigenous microbes was weaker, but the ARG and MGE levels significantly decreased. Mantel test results revealed a stronger correlation between ARGs and microbial communities in the WTM. Network analysis showed that microbial functional groups were more dispersed in the WTM than in the highly clustered structure observed in the CTM. Functionally, CTM-enriched microbial taxa were involved in pollutant remediation and element cycling, whereas WTM-favored taxa were related to nitrogen cycling and greenhouse-specific adaptations. Functional predictions further indicated that WTM enhanced antibiotic biosynthesis pathways and CTM promoted organic matter degradation. These findings suggest that exogenous bacteria-based bioaugmentation holds great promise for cold-region soil remediation; however, greenhouse conditions must be carefully optimized to balance pollutant removal efficiency and the risk of ARG dissemination.

TI  - Distinct Depth-Discrete Profiles of Microbial Communities and Geochemical Insights in the Subsurface Critical Zone
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Microbial assembly and metabolic potential in the subsurface critical zone (SCZ) are substantially impacted by subsurface geochemistry and hydrogeology, selecting for microbes distinct from those in surficial soils. In this study, we integrated metagenomics and geochemistry to elucidate how microbial composition and metabolic potential are shaped and impacted by vertical variations in geochemistry and hydrogeology in terrestrial subsurface sediment. A sediment core from an uncontaminated, pristine well at Oak Ridge Field Research Center in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, including the shallow subsurface, vadose zone, capillary fringe, and saturated zone, was used in this study. Our results showed that subsurface microbes were highly localized and that communities were rarely interconnected. Microbial community composition as well as metabolic potential in carbon and nitrogen cycling varied even over short vertical distances. Further analyses indicated a strong depth-related covariation of community composition with a subset of 12 environmental variables. An analysis of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) quality via ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry suggested that the SCZ was generally a low-carbon environment, with the relative portion of labile DOC decreasing and that of recalcitrant DOC increasing along the depth, selecting microbes from copiotrophs to oligotrophs and also impacting the microbial metabolic potential in the carbon cycle. Our study demonstrates that sediment geochemistry and hydrogeology are vital in the selection of distinct microbial populations and metabolism in the SCZ.IMPORTANCE In this study, we explored the links between geochemical parameters, microbial community structure and metabolic potential across the depth of sediment, including the shallow subsurface, vadose zone, capillary fringe, and saturated zone. Our results revealed that microbes in the terrestrial subsurface can be highly localized, with communities rarely being interconnected along the depth. Overall, our research demonstrates that sediment geochemistry and hydrogeology are vital in the selection of distinct microbial populations and metabolic potential in different depths of subsurface terrestrial sediment. Such studies correlating microbial community analyses and geochemistry analyses, including high resolution mass spectrometry analyses of natural organic carbon, will further the fundamental understanding of microbial ecology and biogeochemistry in subsurface terrestrial ecosystems and will benefit the future development of predictive models on nutrient turnover in these environments.

TI  - Cover crop monocultures and mixtures enhance bacterial abundance and functionality in the maize root zone
T2  - ISME COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Cover cropping is an effective method to protect agricultural soils from erosion, promote nutrient and moisture retention, encourage beneficial microbial activity, and maintain soil structure. Re-utilization of winter cover crop root channels by maize roots during summer allows the cash crop to extract resources from distal regions in the soil horizon. In this study, we investigated how cover cropping during winter followed by maize (Zea mays L.) during summer affects the spatiotemporal composition and function of the bacterial communities in the maize rhizosphere and surrounding soil samples using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing, and metaproteomics. We found that the bacterial community differed significantly among cover crop species, soil depths, and maize growth stages. Bacterial abundance increased in reused root channels, and it continued to increase as cover crop diversity changed from monocultures to mixtures. Mixing Fabaceae with Brassicaceae or Poaceae enhanced the overall contributions of several steps of the bacterial carbon and nitrogen cycles, especially glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. The deeper root channels of Fabaceae and Brassicaceae as compared to Poaceae corresponded to higher bacterial 16S rRNA gene copy numbers and improved community presence in the subsoil regimes, likely due to the increased availability of root exudates secreted by maize roots. In conclusion, root channel reuse improved the expression of metabolic pathways of the carbon and nitrogen cycles and the bacterial communities, which is beneficial to the soil and to the growing crops.

TI  - The Salinity Survival Strategy of Chenopodium quinoa: Investigating Microbial Community Shifts and Nitrogen Cycling in Saline Soils
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Quinoa is extensively cultivated for its nutritional value, and its exceptional capacity to endure elevated salt levels presents a promising resolution to the agricultural quandaries posed by salinity stress. However, limited research has been dedicated to elucidating the correlation between alterations in the salinity soil microbial community and nitrogen transformations. To scrutinize the underlying mechanisms behind quinoa's salt tolerance, we assessed the changes in microbial community structure and the abundance of nitrogen transformation genes across three distinct salinity thresholds (1 g<middle dot>kg(-1), 3 g<middle dot>kg(-1), and 6 g<middle dot>kg(-1)) at two distinct time points (35 and 70 days). The results showed the positive effect of quinoa on the soil microbial community structure, including changes in key populations and its regulatory role in soil nitrogen cycling under salt stress. Choroflexi, Acidobacteriota, and Myxococcota were inhibited by increased salinity, while the relative abundance of Bacteroidota increased. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria showed relatively stable abundances across time and salinity levels. Quinoa possesses the ability to synthesize or modify the composition of keystone species or promote the establishment of highly complex microbial networks (modularity index > 0.4) to cope with fluctuations in external salt stress environments. Furthermore, quinoa exhibited nitrogen (N) cycling by downregulating denitrification genes (nirS, nosZ), upregulating nitrification genes (Archaeal amoA (AOA), Bacterial amoA (AOB)), and stabilizing nitrogen fixation genes (nifH) to absorb nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-_N). This study paves the way for future research on regulating quinoa, promoting soil microbial communities, and nitrogen transformation in saline environments.

TI  - Effects of Land-Use Type and Flooding on the Soil Microbial Community and Functional Genes in Reservoir Riparian Zones
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Ecological processes (e.g., nutrient cycling) in riparian zones are often affected by land-use type and flooding. The extent to which land-use types and flooding conditions affect soil microorganisms and their ecological functions in riparian zones is not well known. By using high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR (q-PCR), we tested the effects of three land-use types (i.e., forest, wetland, and grassland) and two flooding conditions (i.e., landward locations and waterward locations within the land-use types) on soil microbial communities and microbial functional genes in the riparian zones of a reservoir. Land-use type but not flooding significantly affected soil microbial community composition at the phylum level, while both land-use type and flooding significantly affected the orders Nitrosotaleales and Nitrososphaerales. Alpha diversity was higher in the wetland and forest regardless of flooding conditions. Functional gene abundance differed among the three land-use types. Archaeal amoA (AOA) and nirS genes were more abundant in the wetland than in the grassland or forest. Bacterial amoA (AOB), nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes were more abundant in the waterward location than in the landward location but only in the wetland. Soil pH, moisture, and concentrations of soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen were significantly associated with the composition of archaeal and bacterial communities as well as with their gene abundance. This study revealed that soil microorganisms putatively involved in nitrogen cycling in riparian zones were more affected by land-use type than flooding.

TI  - Organic carbon inputs shift the profiles of phosphorus cycling-related genes in maize rhizosphere
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsSoil microbiome is the key driver mediating soil P transformation in agroecosystems. However, the underlying genomic information related to soil P cycling in response to organic C inputs is largely unknown.MethodsBy using metagenomic sequencing, we investigated the effect of P fertilization and C input (i.e., glucose and lignin) on functional profiles of microbial genes related to P cycling in bulk and rhizosphere soils. Maize plants were grown for 47 days in Ultisols with or without P-fertilizer history.ResultsGlucose decreased rhizosphere H2O-Pi concentrations in soil with P history, increased that in soil without P history; while lignin increased that in both soils. Ogranic C inputs increased the relative abundances of phnGHIJLMNP and pit genes by 17-138% and 2.3-31%, decreased those of phoB, phoR and pstABCS genes by 3.6-18%, 12-31% and 11-26%, respectively, in rhizosphere soils irrespective of P history. In the rhizosphere rather than bulk soil, the proportion of P starvation regulation-related genes was higher in lignin treated-soils without than with P history. Proteobacteria (10-89%) and Acidobacteria (0.41-57%) were the dominant phyla and main contributors to soil P transformation-related genes (e.g., appA, phoAD, gcd). Elevated soil pH induced by organic C inputs also diversified the composition of genes involved in P transformation.ConclusionsOrganic C altered P cycling-related gene composition irrespective of soil P status, which facilitated P transformation. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were vital in mediating C and P metabolisms.

TI  - Effect of plant development on phosphorus fractions and microbial phosphorus cycle in subsurface flow constructed wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Plant development can influence the effluent concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) in constructed wetlands (CWs). However, little is known regarding the effect of plant development on P cycling in CWs. In this study, Juncus effusus was selected as wetland plant. The P removal efficiency, the change of P fractions in substrate and the relative abundance of P cycling genes were investigated along with plant development in CWs over seedling, mature, and wilting stages. The results showed that the effluent concentration of TP in CWs varied towards higher levels along with the plant development, and significant differences from the previous two stages were observed at the wilting stage. P fractions in the substrate accumulated with continuing influent, providing conditions for P cycling. There were differences in the relative abundance of functional genes involved in P cycling at different stages of plant development. With plant development, microbial transportation of P (indicated by the genes of phnCDE and ugpABCE) was weakened and then enhanced, while in contrast inorganic P solubilization (indicated by the genes of gcd) and organic P mineralization (indicated by the genes of phnP and phnW) were enhanced and then weakened. Pearson correlation analysis results indicated that the P cycling in the substrate of CWs was enriched with plant development, which promoted labile P accumulation in the CW substrate, resulting in higher effluent TP concentration at the wilting stage. Plant development was found to influence P cycling related microbes by regulating the relative abundance of genes involved in P cycling. The acquired results provided new insights into the effect of plant development on P cycling and effluent TP concentration stabilization in CWs.

TI  - Effects of land reclamation on soil organic carbon and its components in reclaimed coal mining subsidence areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for the development and ecosystem function restoration of reclaimed mine soils (RMSs). To optimize reclamation management practices, this study aims to explore the factors and underlying mechanisms influencing the recovery of SOC and its components in RMSs from a systemic perspective using complex network theory (CNT). This study focused on coal mining subsidence areas in the eastern mining regions of China, comparing reclaimed cultivated land with surrounding non-subsided cultivated land. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm, and 25 soil indicators were measured. CNT was applied to explore the intricate relationships between soil indicators and to identify the key factors and underlying mechanisms influencing SOC and its components in RMSs. The results revealed that the compaction-induced soil structural damage during the reclamation process led to a chain reaction, resulting in increased soil bulk density (11.92 % to 15.03 %), finer soil particles (5.00 % to 9.88 % more clay and silt), and enhanced SOC mineralization (SOC decreased by 10.70 % to 15.62 % with a lower C/N ratio by 2.30 % to 28.55 %). Microbial activity also decreased, with a 6.25 % to 13.16 % drop in MBC and a 0.91 % to 27.68 % decrease in enzyme activity. The utilization of active SOC fractions by more adaptable bacterial communities was crucial within this chain reaction process. The intermediate role of soil structure in the RMS ecosystem, particularly in carbon cycling, becomes more prominent. RMSs exhibited heightened sensitivity to soil structure changes, with the response of microorganisms and enzymes to soil structure changes being pivotal. In the carbon cycling

TI  - Microbiological Transformation of Organic Matter in Oil-Polluted Tundra Soils after Their Reclamation
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - The influence of oil pollution caused by the accident of 1994 on the biological activity of Histic Cryosols is considered. Despite the use of complex mechanical (oil removal), physicochemical (washing on special devices), and agrotechnical (fertilization, plowing, grass sowing) reclamation techniques, the residual content of oil hydrocarbons in the soils can reach high values. The disturbance of the natural peat soil horizon during the reclamation procedures reduces the respiratory activity, as well as the potential rate of consuming the substrates, plant residues and water-soluble organic matter, which decreases the carbon cycle rate.

TI  - Abundances and potential activities of nitrogen cycling microbial communities along a chronosequence of a glacier forefield
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Glacier forefields are ideal ecosystems to study the development of nutrient cycles as well as single turnover processes during soil development. In this study, we examined the ecology of the microbial nitrogen (N) cycle in bulk soil samples from a chronosequence of the Damma glacier, Switzerland. Major processes of the N cycle were reconstructed on the genetic as well as the potential enzyme activity level at sites of the chronosequence that have been ice-free for 10, 50, 70, 120 and 2000 years. In our study, we focused on N fixation, mineralization (chitinolysis and proteolysis), nitrification and denitrification. Our results suggest that mineralization, mainly the decomposition of deposited organic material, was the main driver for N turnover in initial soils, that is, ice-free for 10 years. Transient soils being ice-free for 50 and 70 years were characterized by a high abundance of N fixing microorganisms. In developed soils, ice-free for 120 and 2000 years, significant rates of nitrification and denitrification were measured. Surprisingly, copy numbers of the respective functional genes encoding the corresponding enzymes were already high in the initial phase of soil development. This clearly indicates that the genetic potential is not the driver for certain functional traits in the initial phase of soil formation but rather a well-balanced expression of the respective genes coding for selected functions.

TI  - Lignite amendment has limited impacts on soil microbial communities and mineral nitrogen availability
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The application of lignite (brown coal) as a soil amendment has been shown to provide a number of benefits under certain circumstances, including increased cation exchange capacity, increased phosphorus availability and reduced heavy metal availability. However, there is also evidence that some lignites can have negative impacts on soil biology, with very little known about how lignite affects soil nitrogen (N) dynamics and microbial activity. We conducted a microcosm experiment to assess the influence of lignite from Victoria, Australia, and the same lignite in combination with urea, on soil microbial community composition, biomass, activity and nitrogen cycling. Extractable NO3 and NH4+, microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), microbial respiration and enzymes activities were measured over a 120-day incubation period. The lignite had minor effects on inorganic N concentration in different soil types with or without urea application. Lignite reduced the total CO2 emissions from soil over the incubation period, primarily by inhibiting respiration shortly after application. Changes to total microbial biomass were negligible, but shifts in the soil microbial community caused by lignite or urea application were detected up to 60 days after treatment. During this time, periodic increases in peroxidase and phenol oxidase activities in lignite-treated soils were also observed, but changes in dehydrogenase activities were only apparent in urea-treated soils. Our results indicate that raw Victorian lignite has only a minor, temporary impact on soil microbial activity, community composition and N-cycling and does not increase CO2 emissions over a short time period of investigation. More research is now needed to determine potential longer-term impacts at the field scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Forest thinning effects on soil carbon stocks and dynamics: Perspective of soil organic carbon sequestration rates
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Forest thinning has significantly changed the forest community composition and structure and affected soil microbial activity and carbon (C) cycling. However, how thinning affects the soil C stocks and dynamics, especially the accumulation rate of soil C (RCC) and the driving mechanism of thinning affecting RCC globally, has not yet been revealed. Here, we analyze the effects of forest type (coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed), thinning intensity (light: <33.3 %, moderate: 33.3-66.6 %, and heavy: >66.6 %), and recovery time (0-5, 6-10, and > 10 years) on the RCC by the 1056 data points. Our results showed that thinning increased soil C accumulation; in particular, thinning significantly increased soil C stocks (average value) in the 0-30 and 0-60 cm layers from 70.5 to 76.5 Mg/ha, and from 115.6 to 125.8 Mg/ha, respectively, compared to the un-thinning treatments (control). Furthermore, the RCC in coniferous forests (2.3 Mg/ha yr(- 1)) was higher than that in mixed forests (1.3 Mg/ha yr(- 1)) in 0-60 cm layer. Additionally, the RCC decreased with thinning intensity and recovery time. Finally, the RCC had significant positive relationships with soil pH, whereas initial soil C stock, thinning intensity, and average annual temperature were important factors affecting the RCC. In conclusion, thinning increased the accumulation of soil C in global forest ecosystems, but RCC decreased with increasing thinning intensity and recovery time at the global scale. The results enhance our understanding of the carbon cycle in forest ecosystems during thinning processes.

TI  - Relationship of Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition to Soil Nitrogen Cycling Along an Elevation Gradient in the Colorado Front Range
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
AB  - Microbial processing of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition regulates the retention and mobilization of N in soils, with important implications for water quality. Understanding the links between N deposition, microbial communities, N transformations, and water quality is critical as N deposition shifts toward reduced N and remains persistently high in many regions. Here, we investigated these connections along an elevation transect in the Colorado Front Range. Although rates of N deposition and pools of extractable N increased down the elevation transect, soil microbial communities and N transformation rates did not follow clear elevational patterns. The subalpine microbial community was distinct, corresponding to a high C:N ratio and low pH, while the microbial communities at the lower elevation sites were all very similar. Net nitrification, mineralization, and nitrification potential rates were highest at the Plains (1,700 m) and Montane (2,527 m) sites, suggesting that these ecosystems mobilize N. In contrast, the net immobilization of N observed at the Foothills (1,978 m) and Subalpine (3,015 m) sites suggests that these ecosystems retain N deposition. The contrast in N transformation rates between the plains and foothills, both of which receive elevated N deposition, may be due to spatial heterogeneity not captured in this study and warrants further investigation. Stream N concentrations from the subalpine to the foothills were consistently low, indicating that these soils are currently able to process and retain N deposition, but this may be disrupted if drought, wildfire, or land-use change alter the ability of the soils to retain N.

TI  - NITROGEN CYCLING IN 2 NORWAY SPRUCE (PICEA-ABIES) ECOSYSTEMS AND EFFECTS OF A (NH4)2SO4 ADDITION
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Nitrogen cycling in two Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) ecosystems in the ARINUS experimental watershed areas Schluchsee and Villingen (Black Forest, SW Germany) and initial effects of a (NH4)2SO4 treatment are discussed. Although N reserves in the soils are similar and atmospheric N input is the same low to moderate level characteristic for many forested areas in SW Germany, N export by both seepage and streamwater differs considerably. At Villingen, deposited N is almost totally retained in the ecosystem, whereas at Schluchsee N export is the order of the input. This is explained by differences in forest management history. The Villingen site had been subject to excessive biomass export (e.g., litter raking) leading to unfavorable microbial transformations in the soil. In contrast, as a 'relic' of the former beech stand, the Schluchsee site is characterized by high biological activity in the soil with vigorous nitrification despite low pH values. Accordingly, the two ecosystems responded differently to the additional N input (150 kg NH4+-N ha-1 as (NH4)2SO4). Nitrification starting immediately in the Schluchsee soils led to continued Al mobilization and leaching of basic cations and NO3-. The availability of Mg, already deficient before treatment, further decreased due to Mg leaching and marked N uptake by the stand. In contrast, most of the added N in Villingen was immobilized in the soil. Hence, uptake by the stand and leaching of NO3- and cations was correspondingly lower than at Schluchsee. The results emphasize the problems associated with the definition of generally applicable values for 'critical loads' of N deposition.

TI  - Biofilm Structural and Functional Features on Microplastic Surfaces in Greenhouse Agricultural Soil
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) enter the soil through a variety of pathways, including plastic mulching, sludge, and organic manure application. In recent years, domestic and foreign experts and scholars have been concerned about the residues and contamination of MPs in the soil of greenhouse agriculture. In this investigation, five types of MPs including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and two concentrations (1% and 5%, w/w) were used in a 30-day external exposure test. Evidence of microbial enrichment was found on the surface of the MPs. The total amount of biofilm on the surface of MPs increased dramatically with increasing exposure time and MP concentrations. The polysaccharide content of extracellular polymers (EPS) in biofilms was significantly different, and the maximum PS1 (1% (w/w) PS) concentration was 50.17 mg/L. However, EPS protein content did not change significantly. The dominant bacteria on the surface of MPs with different types and concentrations were specific, and the relative abundance of Patescibacteria was significantly changed at the phylum level. At the genus level, Methylophaga, Saccharimonadales, and Sphingomonas dominated the flora of LDPE1 (1% (w/w) LDPE), PS1, and PET5 (5% (w/w) PET). The dominant bacteria decompose organic materials and biodegrade organic contaminants. According to the FAPROTAX functional prediction study, chemoheterotrophy and aerobic chemoheterotrophyplay a role in ecosystem processes such as carbon cycle and climate regulation. The application of LDPE1 has a greater impact on the carbon cycle. Plant development and soil nutrients in greenhouse agriculture may be influenced by the interaction between MPs and microorganisms in the growing area, while MP biofilms have an impact on the surrounding environment and pose an ecological hazard.

TI  - Global distribution pattern of soil phosphorus-cycling microbes under the influence of human activities
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Human activities have profoundly altered the Earth's phosphorus (P) cycling process and its associated microbial communities, yet their global distribution pattern and response to human influences remain unclear. Here, we estimated the abundances of P-cycling genes from 3321 global soil metagenomic samples and mapped the global distribution of five key P-cycling processes, that is, organic phosphoester hydrolysis, inorganic phosphorus solubilization, two-component system, phosphotransferase system, and transporters. Structural equation modeling and random forest analysis were employed to assess the impact of anthropogenic and environmental factors on the abundance of P-cycling genes. Our findings suggest that although less significant than the climate and soil profile, human-related factors, such as economic activities and population, are important drivers for the variations in P-cycling gene abundance. Notably, the gene abundances were increased parallel to the extent of human intervention, but generally at low and moderate levels of human activities. Furthermore, we identified critical genera, such as Pseudomonas and Lysobacter, which were sensitive to the changes in human activities. This study provides insights into the responses of P-cycling microbes to human activities at a global scale, enhancing our understanding of soil microbial P cycling and underscoring the importance of sustainable human activities in the Earth's biogeochemical cycle.

TI  - Soil labile organic carbon and carbon-cycle enzyme activities under different thinning intensities in Chinese fir plantations
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Thinning is a silvicultural tool that is used to facilitate the growth of timber plantations worldwide. Plantations are important CO2 sinks, but the mechanism by which thinning affects the quantity and stability of soil organic carbon (SOC) is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effects of different thinning intensities (low-intensity thinning treatment with 30% of the trees removed; high intensity thinning treatment with 70% of the trees removed; control treatment without tree removal) on the quantity and stability of SOC in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolate [Lamb.] Hook) plantations in southeastern China. The amounts of SOC, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), cold-water-soluble organic carbon (CWSOC) and hot-water-extractable organic carbon (HWEOC) and the carbon-cycle -related enzyme activities (p-glucosidase, invertase and cellulose) were quantified. We found that thinning significantly decreased the amount of SOC compared with the control treatment, but the effect differed by sampling date. The MBC and EOC were significantly higher in the high-intensity thinning treatment than in the control and low-intensity thinning treatments, whereas the invertase and P-glucosidase activities were significantly higher in the control treatment. However, the amounts of CWSOC, HWEOC and cellulose activity did not differ among the treatments, which indicates that the MBC, EOC and the activities of invertase and p-glucosidase were better indicators of changes in SOC to thinning. In addition, the MBC, EOC, CWSOC and the p-glucosidase and cellulase activities peaked in the warmer months. Our results indicate that thinning treatments in Chinese fir plantations decreased the SOC quantity and enzyme activities and that high-intensity thinning may lead to an increase of labile SOC.

TI  - Ecological distribution of ammonia oxidizers in Yellow River sediments and their influencing factors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Ammonia oxidation, the first and rate-limiting step of nitrification, is a crucial step in nitrogen cycling. The distribution patterns of key ammonia oxidizers, including ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), and comammox (complete ammonia oxidation) Nitrospira, provide vital insights for nitrogen cycling in natural ecosystems. Currently, the distribution and contribution of AOA, AOB and comammox Nitrospira in freshwater ecosystems remain largely underexplored. This study explored the abundances, diversity, phylogenetic characteristics, and community structures of AOA, AOB and comammox Nitrospira in the Yellow River sediments using high-throughput sequencing and qPCR. Comammox Nitrospira displayed the highest amoA gene abundance in sediments from all sampling sites compared to that of AOA and AOB. The diversity of AOA shown no significant correlations with physicochemical properties, while the diversity of AOB negatively correlated with pH (p < 0.05), and the diversity of comammox Nitrospira positively correlated with NH4+ content and TC content (p < 0.05), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis identified Nitrososphaera, Nitrosospira, and cladeA1 as the most dominant clusters of AOA, AOB and comammox Nitrospira, respectively. The community composition of AOA, AOB, and comammox Nitrospira exhibited distinct spatial patterns, varying across the upper, middle and lower reaches. pH was the key factor shaping the community structure of AOB and comammox Nitrospira (p < 0.05), while organic carbon was the key determinant of the AOA community structure (p < 0.05). The results of this study advance our understanding of N cycling in freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Transfer of 14C from naturally depleted peat to freshwater benthic invertebrates in a controlled laboratory system
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
AB  - Radiocarbon (C-14) is a key radionuclide in radioactive waste management due to its long half-life and potential integration into the global carbon cycle. However, its incorporation into freshwater organisms remains poorly understood. This study investigated the transfer of C-14 into two benthic invertebrates, Lumbriculus variegatus and Chironomus riparius, in a controlled experimental system. Naturally C-14 depleted peat was used as the primary carbon source and substrate for the organisms, enabling clear source tracing without artificial labeling but represented a simplified scenario compared to natural sediments with higher nutritional quality. An isotope mixing model based on the natural C-14 abundance partitioned C sources between peat and dietary inputs (fish food and unbleached strips of paper towel). Results showed significantly higher peat-derived C contribution in C. riparius (40 %) than in L. variegatus (<3 %), likely due to more active substrate-feeding of recalcitrant peat during early instars. In contrast, L. variegatus with slower C turnover likely relied on previous dietary C (fish food and unbleached strips of paper towel) or assimilation from fish food in the feeding group rather than feeding on recalcitrant peat with larger particles. Survival rates differed, with lower chironomid survival possibly influenced by a combination of peat characteristics (recalcitrant and acidic), food distribution, and sensitivity of early instars. While these findings provide baseline data for biosphere models of C-14 transfer, the use of peat and simplified conditions limits direct extrapolation to natural systems. Further studies with representative sediments and ecological complexity are needed to improve risk assessments.

TI  - Effects of free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) on belowground processes in a Pinus taeda forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Terrestrial vegetation and soils may act as important carbon sinks if rising atmospheric CO2 stimulates plant production. We used free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) technology to expose three 30 m diameter plots of a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forest to elevated CO2 at 200 mu L/L above ambient levels, while three control plots were outfitted with FACE apparatus but were fumigated with ambient air. We quantified litterfall mass and chemistry, fine root biomass increment and turnover, CO2 efflux from soils, delta(13)C in soil CO2 soil CO2, soil microbial biomass C and N, and potential net N mineralization. After two growing seasons, elevated CO2 caused significant increases in loblolly pine litterfall mass and fine root increment. Within the first year of FACE treatment, the concentration of CO2 in soil had increased, and soil surface CO2 efflux was generally higher at elevated CO2, but this difference was not statistically significant. Loblolly pine litter C:N ratio, fine root turnover, microbial biomass C and N, and potential net N mineralization were not significantly affected by elevated CO2. Our results suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 may accelerate inputs of organic matter to soil C pools in loblolly pine forests, but it may also accelerate losses of C from belowground by stimulating soil respiration.

TI  - Microbial Community Structure and Methane Cycling Potential along a Thermokarst Pond-Peatland Continuum
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - The thawing of ice-rich permafrost soils in northern peatlands leads to the formation of thermokarst ponds, surrounded by organic-rich soils. These aquatic ecosystems are sites of intense microbial activity, and CO2 and CH4 emissions. Many of the pond systems in northern landscapes and their surrounding peatlands are hydrologically contiguous, but little is known about the microbial connectivity of concentric habitats around the thermokarst ponds, or the effects of peat accumulation and infilling on the microbial communities. Here we investigated microbial community structure and abundance in a thermokarst pond-peatland system in subarctic Canada. Several lineages were ubiquitous, supporting a prokaryotic continuum from the thermokarst pond to surrounding peatlands. However, the microbial community structure shifted from typical aerobic freshwater microorganisms (Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria) in the pond towards acidophilic and anaerobic lineages (Acidobacteria and Choroflexi) in the connected peatland waters, likely selected by the acidification of the water by Sphagnum mosses. Marked changes in abundance and community composition of methane cycling microorganisms were detected along the thermokarst pond-peatland transects, suggesting fine tuning of C-1 carbon cycling within a highly connected system, and warranting the need for higher spatial resolution across the thermokarst landscape to accurately predict net greenhouse gas emissions from northern peatlands.

TI  - Tropical forest soil microbial communities couple iron and carbon biogeochemistry
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - We report that iron-reducing bacteria are primary mediators of anaerobic carbon oxidation in upland tropical soils spanning a rainfall gradient (3500-5000 mm/yr) in northeast Puerto Rico. The abundant rainfall and high net primary productivity of these tropical forests provide optimal soil habitat for iron-reducing and iron-oxidizing bacteria. Spatially and temporally dynamic redox conditions make iron-transforming microbial communities central to the belowground carbon cycle in these wet tropical forests. The exceedingly high abundance of iron-reducing bacteria (up to 1.2 x 10(9) cells per gram soil) indicated that they possess extensive metabolic capacity to catalyze the reduction of iron minerals. In soils from the higher rainfall sites, measured rates of ferric iron reduction could account for up to 44% of organic carbon oxidation. Iron reducers appeared to compete with methanogens when labile carbon availability was limited. We found large numbers of bacteria that oxidize reduced iron at sites with high rates of iron reduction and large numbers of iron reducers. The coexistence of large populations of iron-reducing and iron-oxidizing bacteria is evidence for rapid iron cycling between its reduced and oxidized states and suggests that mutualistic interactions among these bacteria ultimately fuel organic carbon oxidation and inhibit CH(4) production in these upland tropical forests.

TI  - Responses of soil microbial biomass carbon and microbial entropy to soil properties in typical sloping croplands of China under erosion conditions
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial entropy play a crucial role in the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems, while their responses to soil properties in typical sloping croplands under the impact of soil erosion remain poorly understood due to the complexity of the soil erosion process. In this study, we selected typical sloping croplands with different erosion levels for the four severely eroded soil types (black, loess, purple, and red soil) in China to assess the key controls of MBC and microbial entropy under the influence of soil erosion. The results showed that soil erosion significantly reduced the MBC content but increased the microbial entropy of sloping croplands in black soil region (BS) (22 %, 43.6 %), purple soil region (PS) (25.5 %, 26.2 %) and red soil region (RS) (28.9 %, 21.9 %), but not in loess soil region (LS). The soil physicochemical properties had significantly positive and negative correlations on the MBC and microbial entropy, respectively. The MBC and microbial entropy of these sloping croplands had different dominant drivers under soil erosion. Overall, our results revealed that changes in MBC and microbial entropy directly depended on the fundamental properties of the soil and soil erosion could indirectly affect the MBC and microbial entropy by directly affecting the physicochemical properties of soil. Thus, the impact of soil erosion on sloping croplands and the associated responses following changes in MBC and microbial entropy provide fresh insights into predicting the effects of soil erosion on carbon stability.

TI  - Redox fluctuations frame microbial community impacts on N-cycling rates in a humid tropical forest soil
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Fluctuating soil redox regimes may facilitate the co-occurrence of microbial nitrogen transformations with significantly different sensitivities to soil oxygen availability. In an upland humid tropical forest, we explored the impact of fluctuating redox regimes on gross nitrogen cycling rates and microbial community composition. Our results suggest that the rapidly fluctuating redox conditions that characterize these upland soils allow anoxic and oxic N processing to co-occur. Gross nitrogen mineralization was insensitive to soil redox fluctuations. In contrast, nitrifiers in this soil were directly affected by low redox periods, yet retained some activity even after 3-6 weeks of anoxia. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was less sensitive to oxygen exposure than expected, indicating that the organisms mediating this reductive process were also tolerant of unfavorable (oxic) conditions. Denitrification was a stronger sink for NO3 in consistently anoxic soils than in variable redox soils. Microbial biomass and community composition were maintained with redox fluctuation, but biomass decreased and composition changed under static oxic and anoxic soil regimes. Bacterial community structure was significantly correlated with rates of nitrification, denitrification and DNRA, suggesting that redox-control of soil microbial community structure was an important determinant of soil N-cycling rates. Specific nitrogen cycling functional groups in this environment (such as nitrifiers, DNRA organisms, and denitrifiers) appear to have adapted to nutrient resources that are spatially and temporally variable. In soils where oxygen is frequently depleted and re-supplied, characteristics of microbial tolerance and resilience can frame N cycling patterns.

TI  - Applying struvite as a N-fertilizer to mitigate N2O emissions in agriculture: Feasibility and mechanism
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an effective ozone-depleting substance and an important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Fertilization is a major factor that dictates agricultural N2O emissions. In this work, as opposed to the commonly-seen highly-soluble nitrogen (N) fertilizers, the feasibility of using struvite as a slow-releasing N fertilizer and its mechanism for mitigating N2O emissions were investigated. During the 149-d field cultivation of water spinach (Ipomoea Aquatica Forsk), struvite exhibited comparable crop yields, with a 40.8-58.1% N2O reduction compared with commercial fertilizers. In addition, struvite fertilization increased soil bacterial diversity and denitrification genes levels (narG, nirS, nirK, norB and nosZ) effectively, but decreased nitrification genes contents (amoA). By conducting partial least-square path modeling, it was found that the use of struvite would satisfy the soil N control and pH regulation, which altered N-cycling related bacteria and ultimately mitigated N2O emissions. From an economic aspect, using struvite as a N-fertilizer may increase the struvite market price from 50 to 131.7 euro/ton. These findings help change the inherent impression that struvite is only suitable as a P-fertilizer, the application of struvite as N-fertilizer could effectively mitigate the agriculture N2O emission and inspire the application of struvite-based P-recovery technologies.

TI  - Phosphorus-mineralizing Communities Reflect Nutrient-Rich Characteristics in Japanese Arable Andisols
T2  - MICROBES AND ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Elucidating the soil phosphorus cycle driven by soil microbes is a vital question in soil microbial ecology. The Japanese arable Andisols, occupying half of the Japanese cropland, are known for their high phosphorus sorption capacity. However, limited information is currently available on microbially driven phosphorus mineralization in arable Andisols. We herein report that the phosphorus-mineralizing community in the Japanese arable Andisols showed characteristic distribution and composition patterns, from those in other types of soils. We performed a chemical analysis and microbial community analysis of 43 amble Andisols along the Japanese archipelago. Soil phosphomonoesterase activities measured at pH 11 were approximately 70% of those at pH 6.5, which indicates that alkaline phosphatase contributes to phosphorus cycling, although most soil samples were acidic. Functional gene predictions based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the alkaline phosphatase gene phoD was more abundant than other alkaline phosphatase genes and, thus, plays major roles. Hence, amplicon sequencing targeting phoD was performed and the results obtained showed that alphaproteobacterial phoD was dominant. This is in contrast to previously reported phoD compositions in other soils and may be attributed to the nutrient conditions in arable Andisols, which favor copiotrophic Alphaproteobacteria. Furthermore, the composition of phoD correlated with soil pH and bioavailable phosphorus concentrations rather than carbon or nitrogen concentrations. These results were partly different from previous findings, varying in the soil types and geographic ranges of sampling sites. Collectively, the present results indicate that the phosphorus-mineralizing community in the Japanese arable Andisols is regulated differently from those in other soil types.

TI  - Effects of first- and second-generation bioenergy crops on soil processes and legacy effects on a subsequent crop
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
AB  - To develop a more sustainable bio-based economy, an increasing amount of carbon for industrial applications and biofuel will be obtained from bioenergy crops. This may result in intensified land use and potential conflicts with other ecosystem services provided by soil, such as control of greenhouse gas emissions, carbon sequestration, and nutrient dynamics. A growing number of studies examine how bioenergy crops influence carbon and nitrogen cycling. Few studies, however, have combined such assessments with analysing both the immediate effects on the provisioning of soil ecosystem services as well as the legacy effects for subsequent crops in the rotation. Here, we present results from field and laboratory experiments on effects of a standard first-generation bioenergy crop (maize) and three different second-generation bioenergy crops (willow short rotation coppice (SRC), Miscanthus x giganteus, switchgrass) on key soil quality parameters: soil structure, organic matter, biodiversity and growth and disease susceptibility of a major follow-up crop, wheat (Triticum aestivum). We analysed a 6-year field experiment and show that willow SRC, Miscanthus, and maize maintained a high yield over this period. Soil quality parameters and legacy effects of Miscanthus and switchgrass were similar or performed worse than maize. In contrast, willow SRC enhanced soil organic carbon concentration (0-5cm), soil fertility, and soil biodiversity in the upper soil layer when compared to maize. In a greenhouse experiment, wheat grown in willow soil had higher biomass production than when grown in maize or Miscanthus soil and exhibited no growth reduction in response to introduction of a soil-borne (Rhizoctonia solani) or a leaf pathogen (Mycosphaerella graminicola). We conclude that the choice of bioenergy crops can greatly influence provisioning of soil ecosystem services and legacy effects in soil. Our results imply that bioenergy crops with specific traits might even enhance ecosystem properties through positive legacy effects.

TI  - Abundance and Diversity of RuBisCO Genes Responsible for CO2 Fixation in Arid Soils of Northwest China
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
AB  - Arid soils where water and nutrients are scarce occupy over 30% of the Earth's total surface. However, the microbial autotrophy in the harsh environments remains largely unexplored. In this study, the abundance and diversity of autotrophic bacteria were investigated, by quantifying and profiling the large subunit genes of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) form I (cbbL) responsible for CO2 fixation, in the arid soils under three typical plant types (Haloxylon ammodendron, Cleistogenes chinensis, and Reaumuria soongorica) in Northwest China. The bacterial communities in the soils were also characterized using the 16S rRNA gene. Abundance of red-like autotrophic bacteria ranged from 3.94 x 10(5) to 1.51 x 10(6) copies g(-1) dry soil and those of green-like autotrophic bacteria ranged from 1.15 x 10(6) to 2.08 x 10(6) copies g(-1) dry soil. Abundance of both red- and green-like autotrophic bacteria did not significantly differ among the soils under different plant. types. The autotrophic bacteria identified with the cbbL gene primer were mainly affiliated with Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and an uncultured bacterial group, which were not detected in the 16S rRNA library. In addition, 25.9% and 8.1% of the 16S rRNA genes were affiliated with Cyanobacteria in the soils under H. ammodendron and R. soongorica, respectively. However, no Cyanobacteria-affiliated cbbL genes were detected in the same soils. The results suggested that microbial autotrophic CO2 fixation might be significant in the carbon cycling of arid soils, which warrants further exploration.

TI  - Salt intrusion alters nitrogen cycling in tidal reaches as determined in field and laboratory investigations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Salinization is a growing problem throughout the world and poses a threat especially to freshwater ecosystems. However, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms by which salinity impacts microbially mediated biogeochemical processes. Elevated nitrogen (N) concentrations in estuarine ecosystems have led to their eutrophication, but the relationship between N transformation and the functional genes involved in the response to saltwater intrusion is poorly understood. Here, using the Minjiang River, a tidal river in southeastern China as an easily accessible natural laboratory, we conducted a 2-year field survey to investigate N speciation during ebb and flood tides. Then, in a laboratory experiment we simulated the varying degrees of salt intrusion that occur in natural tidal reaches. The microcosm study allowed quantitative assessments of N transformation and functional gene responses. The field surveys showed that concentrations of NH4+ rose during flood tides, while the concentrations of NO3- and total N fluctuated. In the microcosms, NO3- concentrations decreased in response to salt pulses, due to simultaneous declines in the abundance of genes responsible for nitrification and increases in the abundance of those involved in dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). The elevated salinity led to increased yields of NH4+, a response that correlated positively with the abundance of nrfA genes, involved in DNRA. Furthermore, an increase in salinity promoted N2O accumulation during the denitrification process. Altogether, our study suggests that saltwater intrusion leads to a decrease in nitrification while favoring N transformation via denitrification and DNRA and that N2O accumulation in the water is dependent on the strength of the salt pulse.

TI  - Meta-analysis reveals that vertebrates enhance plant litter decomposition at the global scale
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - Evidence is mounting that vertebrate defaunation greatly impacts global biogeochemical cycling. Yet, there is no comprehensive assessment of the potential vertebrate influence over plant decomposition, despite litter decay being one of the largest global carbon fluxes. We therefore conducted a global meta-analysis to evaluate vertebrate effects on litter mass loss and associated element release across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here we show that vertebrates affected litter decomposition by various direct and indirect pathways, increasing litter mass loss by 6.7% on average, and up to 34.4% via physical breakdown. This positive vertebrate impact on litter mass loss was consistent across contrasting litter types (woody and non-woody), climatic regions (boreal, temperate and tropical), ecosystem types (aquatic and terrestrial) and vertebrate taxa, but disappeared when evaluating litter nitrogen and phosphorus release. Moreover, we found evidence of interactive effects between vertebrates and non-vertebrate decomposers on litter mass loss, and a larger influence of vertebrates at mid-to-late decomposition stages, contrasting with the invertebrate effect known to be strongest at early decomposition stage. Our synthesis demonstrates a global vertebrate control over litter mass loss, and further stresses the need to account for vertebrates when assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss on biogeochemical cycles.
   Across terrestrial and aqueous ecosystems, vertebrates increase litter decomposition, both directly and indirectly, by 6.7% on average, and this effect interacts with but generally occurs at a later stage of decomposition than the effect of invertebrates.

TI  - Compaction shapes CO2 emission contrasts in sloping farmland: Erosion-deposition zones respond via soil structure and microbiome
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Mechanical compaction and water-induced soil erosion are critical factors influencing soil carbon cycling, particularly on sloped agricultural land. However, their combined effects on soil physicochemical properties, microbial community composition, and CO2 emissions remain insufficiently understood. This study examined the interactive effects of three levels of mechanical compaction-no pressure (NP), low pressure (LP), and high pressure (HP)-at both depositional and erosional sites. The results revealed that compaction and erosion significantly altered soil structure, microbial communities (assessed using the PLFA method), and CO2 influxes. HP reduced soil porosity and aggregate stability, intensifying soil degradation at erosional sites while leading to organic carbon accumulation at depositional sites. Changes in microbial communities were evident, with shift in bacterial-to-fungal ratios depending on site conditions. Increased CO2 emissions at erosional sites were associated with soil structure collapse, whereas enhanced specific surface area at depositional sites contributed to lower emissions. Given that erosional areas generally exceed depositional ones on slopes, compaction-induced erosion led to an overall increase in CO2 emissions, as emissions increased in eroded areas but decreased in depositional zones. This study elucidates the mechanisms by which compaction erosion zones and depositional zones induce different CO2 emissions. In conclusion, the findings highlight the critical role of compaction and erosion in driving carbon cycling on sloped agricultural land. To mitigate CO2 emissions and enhance soil carbon storage, targeted management strategies should focus on reducing soil compaction and preventing erosion, especially in areas prone to degradation.

TI  - Extreme drought decreases soil heterotrophic respiration but not methane flux by modifying the abundance of soil microbial functional groups in alpine peatland
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Extreme drought can have a substantial effect on the soil water content, soil microbial community structure and function, soil heterotrophic respiration (R-h), and soil methane (CH4) flux. However, the effects of extreme drought on R(h )and CH4 flux at different plant growth stages (rapid growth, full bloom, and decline stages) and the main factors driving changes in R-h and CH4 flux remain unclear. We conducted an experiment to reveal the responses of R-h, CH4 flux, and the microbial community to extreme drought and the main factors affecting R-h and CH4 flux. Extreme drought significantly decreased R-h (from 69.41 to 31.37 mg m(-2)h(-1)) at the decline stage but had no significant effect on CH4 flux. Extreme drought significantly decreased bacterial alpha-diversity, markedly decreased the relative abundance of Rokubacteria and Chloroflexi at the rapid growth stage and decline stage, and significantly increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria at the full bloom stage. At the rapid growth and full bloom stages, extreme drought significantly decreased the relative abundance of aromatic hydrocarbon degraders by 50.26% and 64.37%, respectively. At the decline stage, extreme drought significantly decreased the relative abundance of methanol oxidizers and lignin degraders by 81.63% and 82.08%, respectively. A random forest model analysis revealed the most important role of bacterial functional groups in determing R-h and CH(4 )flux. The aromatic compound degraders and aromatic hydrocarbon degraders amounted to 11.89 % of contribution to R-h, and aromatic compound degraders, aromatic hydrocarbon degraders, aliphatic non-methane hy-drocarbon degraders, and methylotrophs amounted to 13.29 % of contribution to CH4 flux. Our findings indicate that microbial functional groups involved in carbon cycles are important factors explaining variation in R-h and CH4 flux and are critical for exploring the possible microbial response mechanism of soil carbon cycling under future scenarios of extreme drought.

TI  - Estimating the greenhouse gas fluxes of European grasslands with a process-based model: 1. Model evaluation from in situ measurements
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
AB  - [1] We improved a process-oriented biogeochemical model of carbon and nitrogen cycling in grasslands and tested it against in situ measurements of biomass and CO(2) and CH(4) fluxes at five European grassland sites. The new version of the model (PASIM) calculates the growth and senescence of aboveground vegetation biomass accounting for sporadic removals when the grassland is cut and for continuous removals when it is grazed. Limitations induced by high leaf area index (LAI), soil water deficits and aging of leaves are also included. We added to this a simple empirical formulation to account for the detrimental impact on vegetation of trampling and excreta by grazing animals. Finally, a more realistic methane emission module than is currently used was introduced on the basis of the quality of the animals' diet. Evaluation of this improved version of PASIM is performed at (1) Laqueuille, France, on grassland continuously grazed by cattle with two plots of intensive and extensive grazing intensities, (2) Oensingen, Switzerland, on cut grassland with two fertilized and nonfertilized plots, and (3) Carlow, Ireland, on grassland that is both cut and grazed by cattle during the growing season. In addition, we compared the modeled animal CH(4) emissions with in situ measurements on cattle for two grazing intensities at the grazed grassland site of Laqueuille. Altogether, when all improvements to the PASIM model are included, we found that the new parameterizations resulted into a better fit to the observed seasonal cycle of biomass and of measured CO(2) and CH(4) fluxes. However, the large uncertainties in measurements of biomass and LAI make simulation of biomass dynamics difficult to make. Also simulations for cut grassland are better than for grazed swards. This work paves the way for simulating greenhouse gas fluxes over grasslands in a spatially explicit manner, in order to quantify and understand the past, present and future role of grasslands in the greenhouse gas budget of the European continent.

TI  - Response of feather moss associated N2 fixation and litter decomposition to variations in simulated rainfall intensity and frequency
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Feather mosses in boreal forests form a dense ground-cover that is an important driver of both nutrient and carbon cycling. While moss growth is highly sensitive to moisture availability, little is known about how moss effects on nutrient and carbon cycling are affected by the dynamics of moisture input to the ecosystem. We experimentally investigated how rainfall regimes affected ecosystem processes driven by the dominant boreal feather moss Pleurozium schreberi by manipulating total moisture amount, frequency of moisture addition and moss presence/absence. Moisture treatments represented the range of rainfall conditions that occur in Swedish boreal forests as well as shifts in rainfall expected through climate change. We found that nitrogen (N) fixation by cyanobacteria in feather mosses (the main biological N input to boreal forests) was strongly influenced by both moisture amount and frequency, and their interaction; increased frequency had greater effects when amounts were higher. Within a given moisture amount, N fixation varied up to seven-fold depending on how that amount was distributed temporally. We also found that mosses promoted vascular litter decomposition rates, concentrations of litter nutrients, and active soil microbial biomass, and reduced N release into soil solution. These effects were usually strongest under low moisture amount and/or frequency, and revealed a buffering effect of mosses on the decomposer subsystem under moisture limitation. These results highlight that both the amount and temporal distribution of rainfall, determine the effect of feather mosses on ecosystem N input and the decomposer subsystem. They also emphasize the role of feather mosses in mediating moisture effects on decomposer processes. Finally, our results suggest that projected shifts in precipitation in the Swedish boreal forest through climate change will result in increased moss growth and N-2 fixation but a reduced dependency of the decomposer subsystem on feather moss cover for moisture retention.

TI  - Dissolved organic matter in peat and marl marshes varies with nutrient enrichment and restored hydrology
T2  - RESTORATION ECOLOGY
AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) drives biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. Yet, how hydrologic restoration in nutrient-enriched ecosystems changes DOM and the consequences of those changes for the carbon cycle remain unclear. To predict the consequences of hydrologic restoration on carbon cycling in restored wetlands, we need to understand how local environmental factors influence production, processing, and transport of DOM. We collected surface water samples along transects in restored peat (organic-rich, macrophyte-dominated) and marl (carbonate, periphyton-dominated) freshwater marshes in the Everglades (Florida, U.S.A.) that varied in environmental factors (water depth, phosphorus [P] concentrations [water, macrophytes, periphyton, and soil], and primary producer biomass) to understand drivers of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and DOM composition. Higher water depths led to a "greening" of DOM, due to increasing algal contributions, with decreasing concentrations of DOC in peat wetlands, and a "browning" of DOM, due to increasing humic contributions, with increasing DOC concentrations in marl wetlands. Soil total P was positively correlated with DOC concentrations and microbial contributions to DOM in peat wetlands, and periphyton total P was positively correlated with algal contributions to DOM in marl wetlands. Despite large variations in both vegetation biomass and periphyton biovolume across transects and sites, neither were predictors of DOC concentrations or DOM composition. Hydrologic restoration differentially alters DOM in peat and marl marshes and interacts with nutrient enrichment to shift proportions of green and brown contributions to surface water chemistry, which has the potential to modify wetland food webs, as well as the processing of carbon by micro-organisms.

TI  - Soil Functional Operating Range Linked to Microbial Biodiversity and Community Composition Using Denitrifiers as Model Guild
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Soil microorganisms are key players in biogeochemical cycles. Yet, there is no consistent view on the significance of microbial biodiversity for soil ecosystem functioning. According to the insurance hypothesis, declines in ecosystem functioning due to reduced biodiversity are more likely to occur under fluctuating, extreme or rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here, we compare the functional operating range, a new concept defined as the complete range of environmental conditions under which soil microbial communities are able to maintain their functions, between four naturally assembled soil communities from a long-term fertilization experiment. A functional trait approach was adopted with denitrifiers involved in nitrogen cycling as our model soil community. Using short-term temperature and salt gradients, we show that the functional operating range was broader and process rates were higher when the soil community was phylogenetically more diverse. However, key bacterial genotypes played an important role for maintaining denitrification as an ecosystem functioning under certain conditions.

TI  - Two decades of altered snow cover does not affect soil microbial ability to catabolize carbon compounds in an oceanic alpine heath
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Snow strongly affects ecosystem functioning in alpine environments with potential carry-over effects outside of snow periods. However, it is unclear whether changes in snow cover affect microbial community functioning in summer. In a field experiment, we tested whether manipulation of snow cover affected the functional capabilities of the microbial community either directly, or indirectly through concomitant changes in the vegetation. While 23 years of differential snow depth and persistence fundamentally changed the vegetation composition, the microbial community's ability to catabolize a range of carbon compounds was not altered. Instead, soil moisture content was the key driver of carbon catabolism by the microbial community.

TI  - Characteristics of methanotrophic communities and their physicochemical driving mechanisms in estuarine and nearshore wetlands of Qinghai Lake
T2  - ISCIENCE
AB  - Methanotrophic communities play avital role in regulating methane fluxes in wetland ecosystems. This study examined the composition and environmental drivers of methanotrophs in estuarine and nearshore wetlands of the Qinghai Lake basin. Soil samples from six sites across three tributaries showed clear spatial and vertical variation in organic matter, nitrogen forms, and salinity. The Heima River estuarine wetland exhibited the highest methanotrophic diversity and functional potential. Dominant genera included Methylobacter, Methylosinus, and Methylocystis, with site-specific distributions. Redundancy analysis identified soil organic matter, nitrate nitrogen, pH, and electrical conductivity as key factors shaping community structure. These findings reveal how water-salt interactions and nutrient status influence methane-oxidizing microbes, offering insights into carbon cycling dynamics in high-altitude wetlands and supporting ecological restoration efforts in plateau regions.

TI  - Global Change Modulates Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency: Mechanisms and Impacts on Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is a key parameter of initial microbial utilization of organic matter in soil. The responses of CUE to global change factors (GCFs) remain unclear due to their multiple effects and interactions. Here, this study generalized 385 observations obtained using various methods, including 13C-/14C-labeled substrates, 18O-labeled water, stoichiometric modeling, and others. The effects of climate change (drought, precipitation, warming), fertilization (nitrogen addition, phosphorus addition, potassium addition, and nitrogen fertilization combined with phosphorus and potassium), land use conversion, and natural restoration, were evaluated along with their 16 associated GCFs on CUE. CUE was insensitive to climate change factors and most fertilization practices, maintaining a mean value of 0.36 under global change scenarios. Farmland conversion to forest and vegetation restoration decreased CUE by 11% and 17%, respectively. Grassland restoration increased CUE by 41%, indicating that grasslands have high potential for soil carbon accrual. Nitrogen fertilization combined with phosphorus and potassium increased CUE by 18% because the combined application of nutrients allows plants to produce organic matter sources with high-quality and decreases nutrient limitations for microorganisms. Increase in soil pH induced by GCFs leads to higher CUE. The CUE was decoupled from soil organic carbon content under several global change scenarios (e.g., warming, fertilization), suggesting that this relationship is not universally consistent across GCFs. This study provides a new perspective on the responses of CUE to GCFs and deepens our understanding of the global change effects on microbial physiology with consequences for soil carbon cycling.

TI  - Biocrusts Mediate the Niche Distribution and Diversity of Ammonia-Oxidizing Microorganisms in the Gurbantunggut Desert, Northwestern China
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) play pivotal ecological roles in regulating nitrogen cycling within desert ecosystems. While acknowledging the essential role played by ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in nitrogen transformation, there remains a paucity of understanding concerning how disturbances to biocrusts impact the diversity and spatial distribution patterns among ammonia oxidizer communities within temperate deserts. This investigation delved into assessing how 4 years' worth of removing biocrust influenced niche differentiation between nitrifying archaea and bacteria while also examining its effects on shaping community structures of predominant ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) within the Gurbantunggut Desert soils. Despite notable variations in abundance of ammonia-oxidizing microbes across distinct soil depths throughout different seasons, it became apparent that removing biocrust significantly altered both the abundance and niche pattern for AOA alongside their bacterial counterparts during winter and summer periods. Notably dominating over their bacterial counterparts within desert soils, AOA displayed their highest archaeal to bacterial amoA gene copy ratio (6549-fold higher) at a soil depth of 5-10 cm during summer. Moreover, substantial impacts were observed upon AOA diversity along with compositional changes following such perturbation events. The aftermath saw an emergence of more diffuse yet dynamic AOA communities, especially noticeable amidst winter when nitrogen and water limitations were relatively alleviated. In summary, our findings underscore how interactions between biocrust coverages alongside factors like soil temperature, total carbon content, or NO3-_N concentrations govern niches occupied by ammoxidation communities whilst influencing assemblage processes too. The sensitivity shown by dominant AOAs towards biocrust removal further underscores how biocrust coverage influences nitrogen transformation processes while potentially involving other communities and functions in desert ecosystems.

TI  - The role of soil redox conditions in microbial phosphorus cycling in humid tropical forests
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Humid tropical forests are among the most productive ecosystems globally, yet they often occur on soils with high phosphorus (P) sorption capacity, lowering P availability to biota. Short-term anoxic events are thought to release sorbed P and enhance its acquisition by soil microbes. However, the actual effects of anoxic conditions on microbial P acquisition in humid tropical forest soils are surprisingly poorly studied. We used laboratory incubations of bulk soils, NanoSIMS analysis of single microbial cells, and landscape-scale measurements in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico to test the hypothesis that anoxic conditions increase microbial P acquisition in humid tropical forests. In laboratory and field experiments, we found that microbial P uptake generally decreased under anoxic conditions, leading to high microbial carbon (C) to P ratios in anoxic soils. The decreased P acquisition under anoxic conditions was correlated with lower microbial C use efficiency (CUE), an index of microbial energy transfer in ecosystems. Phosphorus amendments to anoxic soils led to increased microbial P uptake and higher CUE suggesting that microbes were less able to access and utilize P under natural low redox conditions. Under oxic conditions, microbial C:P ratios and CUE did not respond to changes in substrate stoichiometry. These results challenge the existing paradigm by showing that anoxic conditions can decrease microbial P uptake and ultimately constrain microbial CUE. Our findings indicate that soil redox conditions tightly couple soil P and C cycles and advance our understanding of controls on P cycling in humid tropical forest ecosystems.

TI  - From Disruption to Restoration: Global Impacts of Soil Salinity and Its Mitigation Strategies on Ecosystem Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Salinity impairs soil health by disrupting microbial activity and altering soil physicochemical properties, ultimately undermining ecosystem resilience and productivity. Yet, the effect of salinity and its mitigation strategies on soil nitrogen (N) cycling and plant ammonium and nitrate uptake and N use efficiency is not well established on a global scale. Through a meta-analysis of 3422 paired observations from 309 publications, we found that salinity significantly alters soil N dynamics across multiple pathways. It inhibited the nitrification process by reducing microbial biomass, leading to a substantial accumulation of ammonium (+145%) and nitrite (+203%), while significantly suppressing biological N fixation (-82%). These shifts significantly increased plant uptake of ammonium but reduced that of nitrate and total N, ultimately contributing to a decline in crop yield by 9.5%. Accumulated ammonium in soil also increased ammonia volatilization by 158%. The effect of salinity on soil N availability was context-specific, exhibiting greater effects under high salinity levels, especially in natural ecosystems, arid zones, and alkaline soils. Contrastingly, salinity mitigation treatments led to significant improvements across multiple N pathways. They enhanced soil N pools, including increased biological N fixation and available and total N concentrations. These changes supported greater plant N uptake, resulting in increased N use efficiency and crop yield. However, these benefits were accompanied by a significant increase in nitrous oxide emissions by 80%, indicating a trade-off between environmental impacts and productivity gains. These effects of salinity mitigation treatments on N cycling were more pronounced under the application of organic and mineral fertilizers, as well as crop growth promoters. Collectively, our findings indicate that while salinity appears to impair N cycling by reducing microbial biomass and limiting plant N assimilation, these effects are reversible through mitigation measures. However, further investigation is required to develop salinity mitigation approaches that concurrently minimize nitrous oxide emissions.

TI  - Reconstructing continental-scale variation in soil δ15N: a machine learning approach in South America
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Soil nitrogen isotope composition (delta N-15) is an essential tool for investigating ecosystem nitrogen balances, plant-microbe interactions, ecological niches, animal migration, food origins, and forensics. The advancement of these applications is limited by a lack of robust geospatial models that are capable of capturing variation in soil delta N-15 (i.e., isotopic landscapes or isoscapes). Due to the complexity of the nitrogen cycle and general scarcity of isotopic information, previous approaches have reconstructed regional to global soil delta N-15 patterns via highly uncertain linear regression models. Here, we develop a new machine learning approach to ascertain a finer-scale understanding of geographic differences in soil delta N-15, using the South American continent as a test case. We use a robust training set spanning 278 geographic locations across the continent, spanning all major biomes. We tested three different machine learning methods: cubist, random forest (RF), and stochastic gradient boosting (GBM). 10-fold cross-validation revealed that the RF method outperformed both the cubist and GBM approaches. Variable importance analysis of the RF framework pointed to biome type as the most crucial auxiliary variable, followed by soil organic carbon content, in determining the model performance. We thereby created a biogeographic boundary map, which predicted an expected multiscale spatial pattern of soil delta N-15 with a high degree of confidence, performing substantially better than all previous approaches for the continent of South America. Therefore, the RF machine learning framework showed to be a great opportunity to explore a broad array of ecological, biogeochemical, and forensic issues through the lens of soil delta N-15.

TI  - Biochar mitigates the negative effect of chloropicrin fumigation on beneficial soil microorganisms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Chloropicrin (CP) is the most commonly used soil fumigant worldwide. Although CP effectively controls soil-borne pathogens, it is also detrimental to beneficial soil microorganisms unless measures can be put in place to protect them from the effects of fumigation. In this study, we evaluated the ability of biochar made from the invasive weed Eupatorium adenophorum to mitigate the effects of CP fumigation on beneficial species. Our results showed that the addition of biochar to the soil effectively reduced the detrimental effects of CP on beneficial species and their ecological functions. Biochar added to CP-fumigated soil shortened the time to 28-84 days for microbial diversity and nitrogen cycle functions to be restored to unfumigated levels. At the same time, the inorganic nitrogen (NH4+-N, NO3--N) content and N2O production potential level in CP-fumigated soil returned to unfumigated levels relatively quickly, which showed that nitrogen metabolism improved with the addition of biochar. The mitigation effect of biochar in CP-fumigated soil was more evident at higher biochar amendment rates. Our results suggest that the addition of biochar to CP-fumigated soil significantly reduced the impact of CP on beneficial species and their ecological functions, and significantly shortened the time for beneficial species to recover to pre-fumigation levels. Field research is required to determine biochar's ability to mitigate the impact of CP and other fumigants on beneficial species and to quantify its benefits on crop quality and yield.

TI  - Warming and increased precipitation alter soil carbon cycling in a temperate desert steppe of Inner Mongolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Warming and precipitation are key global change factors driving soil carbon (C) dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects of warming and altered precipitation on soil microbial diversity and functional genes involved in soil C cycling remain largely unknown. We investigated the effects of warming and increased precipitation on soil C cycling in a temperate desert steppe of Inner Mongolia using metagenomic sequencing. We found that warming reduced plant richness, Shannon-Wiener and Simpson index. In contrast, increased precipitation significantly influenced Shannon-Wiener and Simpson index. Warming reduced soil microbial species by 5.4% while increased precipitation and warming combined with increased precipitation led to increases in soil microbial species by 23.3% and 2.7%, respectively. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria, which involve C cycling genes, was significantly increased by warming and increased precipitation. Warming significantly reduced the abundance of GAPDH (Calvin cycle) and celF (cellulose degradation) while it enhanced the abundance of glxR (lignin degradation). Increased precipitation significantly enhanced the abundance of pgk (Calvin cycle), coxL (carbon monoxide oxidation), malZ (starch degradation), and mttB (methane production). Moreover, a wide range of correlations among soil properties and C cycling functional genes was detected, suggesting the synergistic and/or antagonistic relationships under scenario of global change. These results may suggest that warming is beneficial to soil C storage while increased precipitation negatively affects soil C sequestration. These findings provide a new perspective for understanding the response of microbial communities to warming and increased precipitation in the temperate desert steppe.

TI  - Nitrogen cycle bacteria in soils of organically and conventionally managed crop rotations
T2  - ZEMDIRBYSTE-AGRICULTURE
AB  - The aim of the current research was to investigate the influence of organic and conventional farming on certain bacteria (nitrifiers, denitrifiers and azotobacteria) involved in the soil nitrogen cycle. During 2007-2013, field experiments were performed in Central-Estonia (58 degrees 33' N, 25 degrees 34' E) on a sandy loam Albeluvisol (AB) in a five-field crop rotation (winter rye --> potato --> oats --> barley with undersowing --> red clover). The following treatments were carried out: organic without manure, organic with cattle manure, and conventional where manure, mineral fertilizers and pesticides were used. In the treatments, solid cattle manure (60 t ha(-1)) was applied for potato. In 2007-2013, soil samples for microbiological tests were taken from the two fields of the crop rotation from 0-20 cm layer. All soil samples were examined for the total number of bacteria, azotobacteria, denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria using the plate-count method.
   In the organic farming, the application of cattle manure significantly (P < 0.05) increased the total bacteria communities. Also the nitrifying bacteria responded greatly to the soil nutritional status. Their abundance in the organic without manure treatment was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that in the other treatments. There were no significant (P < 0.05) differences in the counts of denitrifying bacteria between the treatments. The repeated application of fungicides and insecticides for potato protection decreased the number of azotobacteria as direct effect by 2.7 times and had a harmful aftereffect on these sensitive bacteria also in succeeding years.

TI  - Black carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments of China's marginal seas
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
AB  - This study investigates the distribution of black carbon (BC) and its correlation with total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (I PAH) pound in the surface sediments of China's marginal seas. BC content ranges from < 0.10 to 2.45 mg/g dw (grams dry weight) in the sediments studied, and varied among the different coastal regions. The Bohai Bay sediments had the highest BC contents (average 2.18 mg/g dw), which comprises a significant fraction (27%-41%) of the total organic carbon (TOC) preserved in the sediments. In comparison, BC in the surface sediments of the North Yellow Sea, Jiaozhou Bay, East China Sea and the South China Sea is less abundant and accounted for an average of 6%, 8%, 14% and 5%, respectively, of the sedimentary organic carbon pool. The concentration of I PAH pound in the surface sediments ranges from 41 to 3 667 ng/g dw and showed large spatial variations among the sampling sites of different costal regions. The Bohai Bay has the highest I PAH pound values, ranging from 79 to 3 667 ng/g dw. This reflects the high anthropogenically contaminated nature of the sediments in the bay. BC is positively correlated to TOC but a strong correlation is not found between BC and I PAH pound in the surface sediments studied, suggesting that BC and PAHs preserved in the sediments are derived from different sources and controlled by different biogeochemical processes. Our study suggests that the abundance of BC preserved in the sediments could represent a significant sink pool of carbon cycling in China's marginal seas.

In this study, paddy soil was amended with wheat straw at 1 and 2% w/w and used for rice growth. The effects of the rhizosphere, straw, and their interaction on soil bacterial community composition and N-cycling gene abundances were assessed at the rice maturity stage. For the soil without straw addition, rice growth, i.e., the rhizosphere effect, significantly altered the bacterial community composition and abundances of N-cycling genes, such as archaeal and bacterial amoA (AOA and AOB), nirK, and nosZ. The comparison of bulk soils between control and straw treatments showed a shift in bacterial community composition and decreased abundance of AOA, AOB, nirS, and nosZ, which were attributed to sole straw effects. The comparison of rhizosphere soils between control and straw treatments showed an increase in the nifH gene and a decrease in the nirK gene, which were attributed to the interaction of straw and the rhizosphere. The number of differentially abundant genera in bulk soils between control and straw treatments was 13-23, similar to the number of 16-22 genera in rhizosphere soil between control and straw treatment. However, the number of genera affected by the rhizosphere effect was much lower in soil amended with straw (3-4) than in soil without straw addition (9). Results suggest possibly more pronounced impacts of straw amendments in shaping soil bacterial community composition.

TI  - Nitrogen cycling microbiomes are structured by plant mycorrhizal associations with consequences for nitrogen oxide fluxes in forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Volatile nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO, NO2, HONO, horizontal ellipsis ) can negatively impact climate, air quality, and human health. Using soils collected from temperate forests across the eastern United States, we show microbial communities involved in nitrogen (N) cycling are structured, in large part, by the composition of overstory trees, leading to predictable N-cycling syndromes, with consequences for emissions of volatile nitrogen oxides to air. Trees associating with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi promote soil microbial communities with higher N-cycle potential and activity, relative to microbial communities in soils dominated by trees associating with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Metagenomic analysis and gene expression studies reveal a 5 and 3.5 times greater estimated N-cycle gene and transcript copy numbers, respectively, in AM relative to ECM soil. Furthermore, we observe a 60% linear decrease in volatile reactive nitrogen gas flux (NOy equivalent to NO, NO2, HONO) as ECM tree abundance increases. Compared to oxic conditions, gas flux potential of N2O and NO increase significantly under anoxic conditions for AM soil (30- and 120-fold increase), but not ECM soil-likely owing to small concentrations of available substrate (NO3-) in ECM soil. Linear mixed effects modeling shows that ECM tree abundance, microbial process rates, and geographic location are primarily responsible for variation in peak potential NOy flux. Given that nearly all tree species associate with either AM or ECM fungi, our results indicate that the consequences of tree species shifts associated with global change may have predictable consequences for soil N cycling.

TI  - Metagenomic reconstruction of nitrogen cycling pathways in a CO2- enriched grassland ecosystem
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The nitrogen (N) cycle is a collection of important biogeochemical pathways mediated by microbial communities and is an important constraint in response to elevated CO2 in many terrestrial ecosystems. Previous studies attempting to relate soil N cycling to microbial genetic data mainly focused on a few gene families by PCR, protein assays and functional gene arrays, leaving the taxonomic and functional composition of soil microorganisms involved in the whole N cycle less understbod. In this study, 24 soil samples were collected from the long-term experimental site, BioCON, in 2009. A shotgun metagenome sequencing approach was employed to survey the microbial gene families involved in soil N cycle in the grassland that had been exposed to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) for >12 years. In addition to evaluating the responses of major N cycling gene families to long-term eCO(2), we also aimed to characterize the taxonomic and functional composition of these gene families involved in soil N transformations. At the taxonomic level, organic N metabolism and nitrate reduction had the most diverse microbial species involved. The distinct taxonomic composition of different N cycling processes suggested that the complex N cycle in natural ecosystems was a result of multiple processes by many different microorganisms. Belowground microbial communities that mediate N cycling responded to eCO(2) in several different ways, including through stimulated abundances of the gene families related with organic decomposition, dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and N-2 fixation, and suppressed abundances of the gene families in glutamine synthesis and anammox. This study provides a genetic basis of the microorganisms involved in key processes in the N cycle in complex ecosystems, and shows that long-term eCO(2) selectively affects N cycling pathways instead of tuning up every process.

TI  - Depth-dependent effects of cover crops in citrus orchards on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, and soil microbial communities
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Fruit orchards are a major part of agricultural production, and planting cover crops (CCs) in the row middles of these agroecosystems can increase soil nutrient availability. However, it is largely unknown how different mixtures of CCs may impact soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) concentrations, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and the soil microbiome at different soil depths, which is important for understanding the contribution of CCs to these agroecosystems. We examined how CC composition (legumes and non-legumes vs. non-legumes only compared to a grower-standard treatment) affects soil properties, nitrification rates and gene abundances, N and C mineralization rates, denitrification gene abundances, and emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and dinitrogen (N2) at different soil depths (0-to 10-cm, 10-to 20-cm, and 20-to 30-cm soil layers) in the row middles of a Florida (USA) commercial citrus orchard after 30 months of CC treatment. We found that CC impacts on soil N and C concentrations and mineralization rates, emissions of N2O and N2, and the abundance of N-cycling genes mainly occurred in the top 0-to 10-cm soil layer whereas differences in these variables in deeper layers were not statistically significant. The combined use of legumes and non-legumes led to significantly greater soil NH4+ concentrations, net nitrification and N mineralization rates, and lower N2O emissions. Lower N2O emissions with legumes were linked to a greater abundance of N2O reducers vs. N2O producers compared to non-legumes alone and the grower-standard treatment in the topsoil layer. This study shows that CC impacts on soil nutrient cycling and microbial communities occur primarily in the topsoil of citrus orchards and that planting diverse CC mix-tures is important to enhance soil-microbe interactions to diminish GHGs.

TI  - Field assessment of sequential herbicide mixtures on nitrogen cycle-related functions in soybean production
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Herbicide applications worldwide generally intend to protect crop yields from weed interference while avoiding mechanical disturbance in the topsoil layer. Their intensive use often leads to cocktails of chemicals in soils, which may interfere with natural soil functions, and productivity. The effects of a sequence of herbicides typically used in soybean crops were tested on different endpoints related to the nitrogen cycle. The field experiment was repeated in 2020-2021 and 2021-2022, from fallow to harvest time of the soybean crop. The treatments were: a control without herbicides, a sequence of three herbicide applications at the label recommended rate, all the six possible combinations of the three herbicide applications, and a treatment with the typical, complete scheme but at twice the recommended rate. The first application was a mixture of glyphosate, dicamba, and clethodim; the second was a mixture of glyphosate, S-metolachlor, and flumioxazin, and the third herbicide application moment included fomesafen only. All the treatments remained weed-free, either by herbicides or manual removal. Significant negative effects were detected for nodulation in some treatments at the vegetative stage compared to the control, but no dose-dependent response was observed. Plant biomass and nodulation were not significantly related to herbicide mixtures at the reproductive stage, nor was the soybean yield at harvest time. These results engender a complex scenario for farmers to fully grasp the potential risks associated with the use of herbicides. However, potential nitrification was affected after the third herbicide application moment in the first year of the experiment, in all the treatments exposed to at least one herbicide application, while the abundance of ammonia oxidizers showed no effects. This comprehensive field assessment is relevant to evaluate herbicide environmental risks, accounting for plant-microbiome interactions under real pedo-climatic conditions and stress factors.

TI  - Coupled Effects of Water Depth, Vegetation, and Soil Properties on Soil Organic Carbon Components in the Huixian Wetland of the Li River Basin
T2  - LAND
AB  - Wetland ecosystems are essential to the global carbon cycle, and they contribute significantly to carbon storage and regulation. While existing studies have explored the individual effects of the water depth, vegetation, and soil properties on the soil organic carbon (SOC) components, a comprehensive study of the interactions between these factors is still lacking, particularly regarding their collective impact on the composition of the SOC in wetland soils. This paper focused on the Huixian Wetland in the Li River Basin. The variations in the SOC and its fractions, namely dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, light fraction organic carbon, and mineral-associated organic carbon, under different water depths and vegetation conditions were examined. Additionally, the effects of the water depth, vegetation, and soil properties (pH and bulk density, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N)) on the changes in the SOC and its components were quantified. Specific water depth-vegetation combinations favor SOC accumulation, with Cladium chinense at a water depth of 20 cm and Phragmites communis at 40 cm exhibiting a higher biomass and higher SOC content. The SOC components were significantly and positively correlated with plant biomass, TP, TN, and NH4-N. The coupling of water depth, vegetation, and soil properties had a significant effect on the SOC components, with the coupling of water depth, vegetation, and soil properties contributing 74.4% of the variation in the SOC fractions. Among them, water depth, plant biomass, and soil properties explained 7.8%, 7.3%, and 6.4% of the changes, respectively, and their interactions explained 25.6% of the changes. The coupling of the three significantly influenced the changes in the SOC components. Optimal water level management and the strategic planting of wetland vegetation can enhance the carbon storage capacity and increase the SOC content. This research offers valuable insights for effectively managing wetland carbon sinks and soil carbon reserves.

TI  - Abundance and productivity mediate invader effects on nitrogen dynamics in a California grassland
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) transformations have been shown to be influenced by plant community composition. Identifying species traits that control nitrogen dynamics is more straightforward when species dramatically differ in N input via litter (e.g., N-fixing invaders in a non-fixing community) or in litter carbon: N or lignin: N ratios. Cases where invaders and residents are more similar for such traits are more challenging to evaluate. In these settings, a species' relative abundance and its contribution to overall ecosystem productivity are likely to contribute significantly to the development of effects on N availability and cycling.
   We compared soil N dynamics in experimental grassland communities dominated by native perennial grasses (NP), exotic annual grasses (EA), and exotic perennial grasses (EP), as well as mixtures of the native perennial grasses with each exotic grass group (NP + EA and NP + EP). These groups differ from each other in subtle ways in traits likely to influence soil N cycling including annual productivity, allocation to roots versus shoots, litter production, litter chemistry, and degree of summertime activity. We found that ecosystem N dynamics were significantly different between the various species groups with the greatest differences occurring between EA plots and other community types: soils in EA plots had significantly lower rates of net N mineralization, net nitrification, and microbial biomass-N compared to either NP or NP + EA plots, and lower extractable nitrate in the spring compared to either NP or EP plots. The higher the proportion of productivity in a plot that derived from exotic species, particularly exotic annual species, the lower were the measured rates of net N mineralization. Stepwise regression analysis showed that vegetation productivity was the best predictor of N cycling metrics: the higher the productivity, the higher the rates of net mineralization and nitrification, and microbial biomass-N.
   We conclude that species' abundance and productivity were strong controlling factors in the development of differences in ecosystem N dynamics between our experimental treatments. Inclusion of relative proportion of productivity contributed by community members in models of the development of species effects will likely aid in predicting when and where invasive species will alter ecosystem N dynamics.

TI  - Vadose Zone Geochemical Heterogeneity Governs Vertical Microbial Assembly in Lakeshore Agricultural Lands
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - The vadose zone is an area spanning from the land surface down to the groundwater table, which serves as a critical carrier of nutrient cycling and enables occurrence of diverse biogeochemical processes. While studies have concentrated on the surface soils (<1 m), a large knowledge gap remains regarding the response of the subsurface microbial community to vadose zone geochemical heterogeneity, particularly under long-term agricultural activities. In this study, 12 boreholes were drilled across two lakeshore agricultural landscapes (paddy and aquaculture) in the Poyang Lake area, China. Compared to aquaculture environments, paddy environments exhibited higher pH, lower moisture, more oxidizing conditions, greater dissolved organic nitrogen and lower dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Across both sites, nutrients (C, N, P, Fe), moisture, cation exchange capacity, and most cations generally declined logarithmically with depth. However, fluctuations were observed below the 2-3 m depth which was the middle layer within the entire vadose zone, with more pronounced variations at deeper layers of aquaculture site likely due to historical agricultural activities and groundwater fluctuation. Microbial diversity, nitrogen cycling potential and resilience to environmental changes decreased with depth until 2-3 m but subsequently increased, likely driven by nutrient availability and a lithological shift from clay to sand. The contributions of stochastic processes (e.g., dispersal limitation and drift) to microbial community assembly grew with depth, with the paddy site exhibiting a greater degree of stochastic assembly than the aquaculture site. This study enhances our understanding of the assembly mechanisms of microbial communities in the vadose zones.

TI  - Biogeochemical limitations of carbon stabilization in forest subsoils
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Background Soils are important carbon (C) sinks or sources and thus of utmost importance for global carbon cycling. Particularly, subsoils are considered to have a high potential for additional C storage due to mineral surfaces still available for sorptive stabilization. Aims Little information exists about the extent to which additional litter-derived C is transferred to and stabilized in subsoils. This study aimed at evaluating the role of litter-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) inputs for the formation of stable mineral-associated C in subsoils. Methods We carried out a multiple-method approach including field labeling with C-13-enriched litter, exposure of C-13-loaded reactive minerals to top- and subsoils, and laboratory sorption experiments. Results For temperate forest soils, we found that the laboratory-based C sink capacity of subsoils is unlikely to be reached under field conditions. Surface C inputs via litter leachates are little conducive to the subsoil C pool. Only 0.5% of litter-derived C entered the subsoil as DOM within nearly 2 years and most of the recently sorbed C is prone to fast microbial mineralization rather than long-term mineral retention. Desorption to the soil solution and an adapted microbial community re-mobilize organic matter in subsoils faster than considered so far. Conclusions We conclude that the factors controlling the current mineral retention and stabilization of C within temperate forest subsoils will likewise limit additional C uptake. Thus, in contrast to their widely debated potential to accrue more C, the role of forest subsoils as future C sink is likely overestimated and needs further reconsideration.

TI  - High soil microbial activity in the winter season enhances nitrogen cycling in a cool-temperate deciduous forest
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The soil microbial community plays essential roles in bioavailable nitrogen (N) cycling, and microbial dynamics during the plant dormant season could affect N cycling in the subsequent growing season. Despite frequent observations of seasonal shifts in microbial community composition in forests, the biogeochemical consequences for bioavailable N cycling have not been well characterized. Here we examine the relationship between microbial community dynamics and bioavailable N dynamics throughout a year in a cool-temperate deciduous forest, with a focus on the dormant season. Specifically, we analyzed temporal changes in abundances of N cycling microbial populations and N concentrations and transformations in soils. We also assessed temporal changes in bacterial community composition by deep sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Even though the bacterial community composition was stable throughout the year, we found a drastic increase in abundances of total bacterial and fungal populations in the mid-winter, followed by a subsequent decrease during the snowmelt period in the early spring. We also found a temporary increase in abundances of NH3-oxidizing bacterial population in the mid-winter and of denitrifying bacterial and fungal populations during the snowmelt period. Correspondingly, soil NH4+, NO3-, and dissolved organic N concentrations sequentially peaked in the winter and early spring. These results suggest that successive growth of litter degraders, ammonifiers, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers in the dormant season drives the subsequent bioavailable N transformations. High microbial N metabolic activities during the dormant season could also support plant growth during the growing season and increase the efficiency of annual N cycling in the forest via the seasonal partitioning of N between plants and microbial communities.

TI  - Trade or scavenge? Miscanthus-microbiome interactions depend upon soil fertility
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Miscanthus x giganteus (Miscanthus) is a robust bioenergy crop, able to withstand the poor soil fertility found on marginal lands (e.g., anthropogenically disturbed lands). Mounting evidence suggests that this robustness is related to the ability of Miscanthus to partner with soil microorganisms to gain nutrients. Of particular interest is how Miscanthus may alter microbially-mediated nitrogen (N) cycling (e.g., N-fixation and mineralization) resulting in efficient N acquisition across a range of soil fertility levels. However, a mechanistic understanding of how Miscanthus responds to and influences soil nitrogen cycling under the variable soil properties that emerge from land disturbance is lacking. Further, it remains unclear whether these plant-growth promoting microbial functions can be bolstered by directly managing microbial community composition (i.e., biofertilization). To address these knowledge gaps, we performed a greenhouse experiment with Miscanthus grown in soil from two sites with different soil fertility levels (e.g., differences in soil texture, inorganic nitrogen, and C/N). We also tested the effect of two biofertilizers (commercially available biofertilizer or a soil transplant from a mature Miscanthus stand) on Miscanthus growth or plant-microbe interactions. We surveyed microbial community composition via community-based amplicon sequencing and quantified function by measuring the activity of prokaryotic N-fixers and nitrifiers. Initial soil fertility outweighed biofertilization in determining microbial community composition and function. Specifically, when Miscanthus was grown in low fertility soil from a highly disturbed site, rates of N fixation by free-living N-fixers increased. This increase was accompanied by increases in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) abundance suggesting a synergism between N fixation rates and AMF that facilitates plant nitrogen acquisition. These effects of Miscanthus on the soil microbiome composition and function were less pronounced in the high fertility soil with more nitrogen. This suggests a scenario where, under nitrogen limitation, Miscanthus trades with symbionts providing carbon to nitrogen fixing bacteria and AMF to acquire nitrogen. Alternatively, when nitrogen is more plentiful, Miscanthus may scavenge nutrients, obtaining nitrogen released from organic matter by saprotrophs. These observations aid in illuminating how Miscanthus can dynamically shape microbial functions occurring in its rhizosphere which more broadly increases our understanding of plant-microbe interactions and bioenergy agroecosystems.

TI  - Species identity of biocrust-forming lichens drives the response of soil nitrogen cycle to altered precipitation frequency and nitrogen amendment
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are fundamental components of drylands worldwide, and are of great importance for the regulation of ecosystem functioning. However, little is known on the role of species identify of biocrust-forming lichens in mediating the response of nitrogen (N) cycling to concurring global environmental change. Here, we conducted a microcosm study to evaluate how the species identity of biocrust-forming lichens (Diploschistes thunbergianus, Psora crystallifera and Xanthoparmelia reptans) regulate key processes of N cycling in response to simulated changes in rainfall frequency and N addition. We explicitly considered both direct and indirect effects (i.e. driven via microbial diversity and abundance) of global changes on N availability and losses using structural equation models. Our results showed that species of biocrust-forming lichens differentially mediated effects of N amendment and altered rainfall frequencies on belowground nitrate availability and N2O flux rate. For instance, soils under P. crystallifera species showed the highest increase in nitrate content in response to N amendment under low rainfall frequency. Moreover, soils under D. thunbergianus showed the highest N2O flux under high rainfall frequency without N addition. Interestingly, soils under X. reptans showed lowest and highest resistance in nitrate availability and N2O flux, respectively, in response to N addition regardless of different rainfall frequencies. Strikingly, we only found an indirect impact of either rainfall frequency or N amendment on the nitrate availability (but not N2O flux) driven via the ammonia-oxidizing community under X reptans. Our results provide evidence that the species identity of biocrust-forming lichens modulates the response of N cycling to global change drivers. These findings have implications for predicting the potential consequence of altered rainfall patterns and environmental N inputs in dryland ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Abundance of microbial genes associated with nitrogen cycling as indices of biogeochemical process rates across a vegetation gradient in Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Nitrification and denitrification processes are crucial to plant nutrient availability, eutrophication and greenhouse gas production both locally and globally. Unravelling the major environmental predictors for nitrification and denitrification is thus pivotal in order to understand and model environmental nitrogen (N) cycling. Here, we sampled five plant community types characteristic of interior Alaska, including black spruce, bog birch, tussock grass and two fens. We assessed abundance of functional genes affiliated with nitrification (bacterial and archaeal amoA) and denitrification (nirK/S and nosZ) using qPCR, soil characteristics, potential nitrification and denitrification rates (PNR and PDR) and gross mineralization rates. The main chemical and biological predictors for PNR and PDR were assigned through path analysis. The potential N cycling rates varied dramatically between sites, from some of the highest (in fens) to some of the lowest (in black spruce) measured globally. Based on path analysis, functional gene abundances were the most important variables to predict potential rates. PNR was best explained by bacterial amoA gene abundance followed by ammonium content, whereas PDR was best explained directly by nosZ gene abundance and indirectly by nirK/S gene abundance and nitrate. Hence, functional gene abundance is a valuable index that integrates recent environmental history and recent process activity, and therefore is a good predictor of potential rates. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the relative importance of different biological and chemical factors in driving the potential for nitrification and denitrification across terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Effect of Nitrogen Addition on Soil Microbial Functional Gene Abundance and Community Diversity in Permafrost Peatland

However, the response of belowground microbe to nitrogen addition in peatland ecosystems remains largely unknown. In this study, we performed long-term nitrogen addition experiments in a permafrost peatland in the northwest slope of the Great Xing'an Mountains. The four nitrogen addition treatments applied in this study were 0 g N center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) (CK), 6 g N center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) (N1), 12 g N center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) (N2), and 24 g N center dot m(-2)center dot year(-1) (N3). Effects of nitrogen addition over a period of nine growing seasons on the soil microbial abundance and community diversity in permafrost peatland were analyzed. The results showed that the abundances of soil bacteria, fungi, archaea, nitrogen-cycling genes (nifH and b-amoA), and mcrA increased in N1, N2, and N3 treatments compared to CK. This indicated that nitrogen addition promoted microbial decomposition of soil organic matter, nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation, nitrification, and methane production. Moreover, nitrogen addition altered the microbial community composition. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria increased significantly in the N2 treatment. However, the relative abundances of Actinobacteria and Verrucifera in the N2 treatment and Patescibacteria in the N1 treatment decreased significantly. The heatmap showed that the dominant order composition of soil bacteria in N1, N2, and N3 treatments and the CK treatment were different, and the dominant order composition of soil fungi in CK and N3 treatments were different. The N1 treatment showed a significant increase in the Ace and Chao indices of bacteria and Simpson index of fungi. The outcomes of this study suggest that nitrogen addition altered the soil microbial abundance, community structure, and diversity, affecting the soil microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling in permafrost peatland. The results are helpful to understand the microbial mediation on ecological processes in response to N addition.

TI  - Microorganisms Promote Soil Phosphorus Bioavailability at the Beginning of Pedogenesis
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The rapid accumulation of bioavailable phosphorus (Bio-P) promotes ecosystem development at the beginning of pedogenesis in the Hailuogou Glacier foreland. However, the role of microorganisms in Bio-P accumulation during early pedogenesis remains unclear. Using the Hailuogou Glacier foreland on Gongga Mountain as a natural laboratory, microbial community assembly, co-occurrence networks, and phosphorus cycling genes (PCGs) were examined across four successional stages, from bare land to moss crust. The results showed that bacteria were dominant at all stages. Microbial diversity and evenness increased gradually, whereas the topological properties of the microbial network initially increased and then decreased. Community assembly is mainly driven by deterministic processes under environmental pressures. At the beginning of pedogenesis, microorganisms adapt to scarce Bio-P conditions by enhancing the functional potential of key PCGs (e.g., pqqE, gcd, phoD, and 3-Phytase), which mediate mineral phosphorus solubilization and organic phosphorus mineralization. Tight cooperative network structures within microbial communities and dominant microbial taxa were the major factors accelerating Bio-P. Thus, it can be concluded that microorganisms promote Bio-P accumulation at the beginning of pedogenesis by regulating PCGs and typical microbial community construction. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which microbial communities regulate phosphorus dynamics during pedogenesis, particularly on newly exposed land resulting from global change in alpine and polar regions.

CP  - 11th Nitrogen Cycle Meeting
AB  - Any attempt to characterize a bacterial community and their functional genes coding for enzymes of the nitrogen cycle is faced with its extreme biodiversity. Novel techniques, based on PCR amplification of target genes in DNA from environmental samples, have been developed for characterizing both cultured and as yet uncultured bacteria in the last few years. Computer-based assignment tools have now been developed utilizing terminal restriction fragments obtained from digestions with multiple restriction enzymes. Such programs allow the gross characterization of bacterial life in any complex bacterial community with confidence.

TI  - Effects of Nutrient Input on Soil Nitrogen Cycle in Winter in the Alpine Zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOBASED MATERIALS AND BIOENERGY
AB  - Microbial activity is rapidly reduced due to the decrease in temperature, but does not completely cease in the cold season. The snowpack in late winter insulates the soil and further increases soil temperature, allowing microbes to remain active and inducing a shift in the nature of N processing in alpine areas. Microbes need both carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) for their growth and metabolism and the scarcity of either will limit their activity. So soil available N pools and N cycling were closely linked to the C and N of the soil. Many previous studies showed the different results in different regions. Some of the results were considered to be C limited, some considered to be N limited, and also some considered to have little impact. However, which factor limited soil microbes and controlled soil N mineralization was not clear in the alpine belt of the eastern Qinghai Tibet Plateau. In present study, the effects of litter addition in situ and nutrient factors input in laboratory on soil mineral N pools and N mineralization in the eastern Qinghai Tibet Plateau were explored. A significant decrease in soil MBN content, NH4+-N content, increase in soil NO3-N content and net N mineralization, and no change in DON contents were observed with litter input. Direct input of C in laboratory decreased mineral N pools, while mineral N contents increased when N was added. The results suggested that the soil N cycling was influenced by the addition of available C, and the C-limitation occurs in winter in the Eastern Qinghai Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Integrated reclamation of saline soil nitrogen transformation in the hyphosphere by earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil salinization greatly alters nitrogen cycling and threatens the sustainable productivity of food production areas worldwide. A two-compartment microcosm was used to investigate the integrated effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) hyphae and earthworms on nitrogen transformation at different incubation times in saline soil. The treatments were designed with or without hyphae and with or without earthworms harvested at day 40 or 60 in the hyphal compartments (HC). Salt concentration, soil aggregate-size distribution, soil organic carbon, hyphal length density (HLD), total glomalin-related soil protein (TGRSP), inorganic nitrogen concentrations, microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) and the N-functional marker genes were determined in the HC. The results showed that earthworms and AMF hyphae decreased the soil salt concentration, while increased the soil NO3--N, NH4+-N, MBN and the abundance of nifH and AOB amoA genes. Earthworms and AMF hyphae could independently or cooperatively affect soil macroaggregates. Earthworms and AMF hyphae affected soil NH4+-N and NO3--N by increasing the soil macroaggregates and MBN. At day 60, earthworms affected soil NO3-N by regulating the abundance of nifH and AOB amoA genes, while AMF hyphae increased soil NH4+-N by regulating the HLD and TGRSP. In conclusion, earthworms and AMF hyphae cooperatively affected soil NO3--N and NH4+-N by regulating the soil macroaggregates, microbial biomass nitrogen and N-cycling bacteriain saline soil. The results would be useful in reclamation programmes undertaken to rehabilitate land sources that suffer from problems associated with soil salinization.

TI  - Effects of Stocking Rates and Simulated Precipitation on Soil Respiration in a Stipa breviflora Desert Steppe, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - The subject of this study was to understand how grazing and precipitation affect the carbon cycle of grassland ecosystem. The experiment was carried out in a desert steppe of Siziwang Banner, Inner Mongolia, China, and measured CO2 flux and abiotic factors twice a month during the growing season (July to October in 2016, May to October in 2017). The experiment used a completely randomized block design, involving four different stocking rate treatments [CK, no grazing, (0 sheep unit hm(-2) half year(-1)), light stocking rate (LG, 0.93 sheep unit hm(-2) half year(-1)), moderate stocking rate (MG, 1.82 sheep unit hm(-2) half year(-1)) and heavy stocking rate (HG, 2.71 sheep unit hm(-2) half year(-1))] with three replicates, and four precipitation treatments [50% reduced precipitation (P1), natural precipitation (P2), 50% increased precipitation (P3) and 100% increased precipitation (P4)] were set up in each stocking rate treatment plot. Results indicated that increased precipitation treatments significantly increased soil water content (SWC) and soil respiration (Rs), and significantly reduced soil temperature (Ts), grazing treatments significantly reduced Ts, the interaction between precipitation and stocking rate had no significant impact on the above indicators; Rs increased with increasing precipitation in the order: P4 > P3 > P2 > P1, Rs exhibited the following order under different stocking rates: CK > LG > MG > HG. There was a strong positive correlation between Rs and SWC, and a negative relationship between Rs and Ts. Our results demonstrate that SWC is the dominant factor affecting Rs, as SWC explained 87.12% of the variation in Rs.

TI  - Interrelationships among methods of estimating microbial biomass across multiple soil orders and biomes
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Understanding the role of soil microbes is critical to ecosystem processes, and more thorough comparisons of measurement proxies for soil microbial biomass could broaden the inclusion of explicit microbial parameterization in soil carbon cycling and earth system models. We measured physical, chemical, and biological data from eight soil orders representing 11 major biomes and four climate regions. Four prominent methods to measure microbial abundance-chloroform fumigation extraction (CFE), total DNA yield, gene copy number by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (GCN), and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA)-were compared to assess their relationships with each other and with soil characteristics. Correlations were observed when comparing methods, with CFE correlating strongly with total DNA yield, GCN, and PLFA; CFE with bacterial GCN and bacterial PLFA; and to a lesser extent, total PLFA and total DNA yield. Correlations improved with the removal of organic soils (Histosols, Gelisols). Comparisons involving extracted DNA were improved by correcting for clay content, due to DNA extraction inefficiencies in clay-rich soils. Correlations involving fungi (PLFA or GCN) were always less significant. These methods could serve as reliable, inter-relatable proxies for the estimation of total soil microbial biomass while recognizing that the proxies are less effective at parsing differences between bacteria and fungi. We provide specific equations to relate measures of soil microbial biomass by these four different methods to enable microbial models to utilize a greater diversity of observed data sources in parameterizations and simulations. Caveats for the equations and their values are also discussed.

TI  - Responses of Phosphate-Solubilizing Microorganisms Mediated Phosphorus Cycling to Drought-Flood Abrupt Alternation in Summer Maize Field Soil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil microbial communities are essential to phosphorus (P) cycling, especially in the process of insoluble phosphorus solubilization for plant P uptake. Phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) are the dominant driving forces. The PSM mediated soil P cycling is easily affected by water condition changes due to extreme hydrological events. Previous studies basically focused on the effects of droughts, floods, or drying-rewetting on P cycling, while few focused on drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA), especially through microbial activities. This study explored the DFAA effects on P cycling mediated by PSM and P metabolism-related genes in summer maize field soil. Field control experiments were conducted to simulate two levels of DFAA (light drought-moderate flood, moderate drought-moderate flood) during two summer maize growing periods (seeding-jointing stage, tasseling-grain filling stage). Results showed that the relative abundance of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and phosphate-solubilizing fungi (PSF) increased after DFAA compared to the control system (CS), and PSF has lower resistance but higher resilience to DFAA than PSB. Significant differences can be found on the genera Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, and Penicillium, and the P metabolism-related gene K21195 under DFAA. The DFAA also led to unstable and dispersed structure of the farmland ecosystem network related to P cycling, with persistent influences until the mature stage of summer maize. This study provides references for understanding the micro process on P cycling under DFAA in topsoil, which could further guide the DFAA regulations.

TI  - Characterizing Dissolved Organic Matter and Other Water-Soluble Compounds in Ground Ice of the Russian Arctic: A Focus on Ground Ice Classification within the Carbon Cycle Context
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
AB  - Climate-induced changes contribute to the thawing of ice-rich permafrost in the Arctic, which leads to the release of large amounts of organic carbon into the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide and methane. Ground ice constitutes a considerable volume of the cryogenically sequestered labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) subjected to fast mineralization upon thawing. In this work, we collected a unique geochemical database of the ground and glacier ice comprising the samples from various geographic locations in the Russian Arctic characterized by a variety of key parameters, including ion composition, carbon-bearing gases (methane and carbon dioxide), bulk biogeochemical indicators, and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM) fractions. Our results show that interaction with solid material-such as sediments, detritus, and vegetation-is likely the overriding process in enrichment of the ground ice in all the dissolved compounds. Terrigenous humic-like dissolved organic matter was predominant in all the analyzed ice samples except for glacier ice from Bolshevik Island (the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago) and pure (with low sediment content) tabular ground ice from western Yamal. The labile protein-like DOM showed no correlation to humic components and was probably linked to microbial abundance in the ground ice. The sum of the fluorophores deconvoluted by PARAFAC strongly correlates to DOC, which proves the potential of using this approach for differentiation of bulk DOC into fractions with various origins and biogeochemical behaviors. The pure tabular ground ice samples exhibit the highest rate of fresh easily degradable DOM in the bulk DOC, which may be responsible for the amplification of permafrost organic matter decomposition upon thawing.

TI  - The addition of discrimination inhibitors stimulations discrimination potential and N2O emissions were linked to predation among microorganisms in long term nitrogen application and straw returning systems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) have been proven to be key microorganisms driving the ammonia oxidation process. However, under different fertilization practices, there is a lack of research on the impact of interaction between predators and AOA or AOB on nitrogen cycling at the multi-trophic level. Methods: In this study, a network-oriented microscopic culture experiment was established based on four different long-term fertilization practices soils. We used the nitrification inhibitors 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxide-3-oxyl (PTIO) and 3, 4-Dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) inhibited AOA and AOB, respectively, to explore the impact of interaction between protists and AOA or AOB on nitrogen transformation. Results: The results showed that long-term nitrogen application promoted the potential nitrification rate (PNR) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, and significantly increased the gene abundance of AOB, but had no obvious effect on AOA gene abundance. DMPP significantly reduced N2O emission and PNR, while PTIO had no obvious effect on them. Accordingly, in the multi-trophic microbial network, Cercozoa and Proteobacteria were identified as keystone taxa of protists and AOB, respectively, and were significantly positively correlated with N2O, PNR and nitrate nitrogen. However, Nitrososphaerota archaeon as the keystone species of AOA, had an obvious negative linkage to these indicators. The structural equation model (SEM) showed that AOA and AOB may be competitors to each other. Protists may promote AOB diversity through direct trophic interaction with AOA. Conclusion: The interaction pattern between protists and ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms significantly affects potential nitrification rate and N2O emission, which has important implications for soil nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Fertilizer management methods affect bacterial community structure and diversity in the maize rhizosphere soil of a coal mine reclamation area
T2  - ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundThe filling or mixed stack mode is a frequently used coal mine reclamation engineering technique that results in changes in soil microbial community structure and nutrient content, which lead to considerable deviations from the characteristics of restored coal mine reclamation areas that can be used for farming. Fertilization is an effective strategy for improving soil fertility in such areas; however, the response of soil bacterial communities, especially in the crop rhizosphere soil, to different fertilization techniques in such soils remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effects of different fertilization management methods, including no fertilizer, farmers' practice, inorganic fertilizer, organic fertilizer, and organic-inorganic fertilizer, on maize yield, rhizosphere soil bacterial community and diversity, soil physicochemical properties, and nitrogen cycle-related gene abundance (nifH, AOB, and nirS).ResultsThe results showed that organic-inorganic fertilizer treatment significantly improved maize yield. The relative abundance of the dominant phyla did not significantly differ between the treatment groups. However, the Chao 1 and Shannon indices of the bacterial community significantly changed between the no fertilizer and organic-inorganic fertilizer treatments. Notably, organic-inorganic fertilizer application significantly increased the copy numbers of nifH and nirS. Further, moisture, bulk density, and available phosphorus content were identified as the major driving factors responsible for the changes in bacterial community structure, diversity, and copy numbers of nifH, nirS, and AOB.ConclusionsThe results of this study revealed that organic-inorganic fertilizer application improved soil bacterial diversity and the copy numbers of nifH and nirS in maize rhizosphere soil. Therefore, we concluded that organic-inorganic fertilizer is an effective strategy for the restoration of maize rhizosphere soil properties and bacterial communities in coal mine reclamation areas.

TI  - Organic substitutions aggravated microbial nitrogen limitation and decreased nitrogen-cycling gene abundances in a three-year greenhouse vegetable field
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Partially substituting chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer has substantially changed the stoichiometric imbalances of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) between microbial communities and their available resources in agroecosystems. However, how organic substitution alters microbial nutrient limitation and then affects soil N cycle in intensive greenhouse vegetable ecosystem, remain unknown. Thus, we performed a threeyear greenhouse vegetable field experiment in China with different fertilization strategies: no N fertilization, chemical N fertilization, and substituting 20% (1M4N) or 50% (1M1N) of chemical N with organic fertilizer (organic substitutions). Our results demonstrated that the microbial communities presented N limitation, accompanying with a strong N:P but a weak C:N (or P) microbial homeostasis in response to high N:P imbalance among all treatments. Organic substitutions at 1M1N and 1M4N significantly aggravated microbial N limitation and decreased the gene abundances of nitrification and denitrification by 4.7%?27.3% than that of chemical N fertilization. Microbial N limitation was strongly influenced by N:P stoichiometric imbalance illustrated from regression analysis. The N-cycling gene abundances were not only dependent on the inorganic N pool and soil physicochemical properties (i.e. pH and electrical conductivity), but also affected by microbial nutrient limitation inferred from random forest analysis. Furthermore, the 1M1N treatment performed better than the 1M4N in terms of improved crop yield and less microbial N limitation. Overall, these results highlight the importance of ecological stoichiometry in regulating soil N cycle under different fertilization strategies for intensive greenhouse vegetable ecosystem.

TI  - Planting Trees on Sandy Saline Soil Increases Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Content by Altering the Composition of the Microbial Community
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - The remediation and exploitation of sandy saline soils, an underutilized resource, can be enhanced by a greater comprehension of the impact of plants and microorganisms on nutrient cycling. However, there is scant research information on the capacity of different trees and shrubs to improve carbon and nitrogen cycling in saline soils at different depth layers. This study investigated the effect of the trees Zelkova serrata (ZS) and Ligustrum lucidum (LL) and shrub Hibiscus syriacus (HS) on the carbon and nitrogen fractions, soil enzyme activities and microbial communities in sandy saline soils. Planting ZS, LL or HS improved soil quality, increased soil carbon and nitrogen content, changed rhizosphere soil metabolites and enhanced soil enzyme activities and microbial abundance and diversity. Compared to values in the bare soil, the highest reduction in soil salinity was noticed under Zelkova serrata (49%) followed by Ligustrum lucidum (48%). The highest increase in total soil organic carbon (SOC) was noted under Ligustrum lucidum and Hibiscus syriacus (62% each), followed by Zelkova serrata (43%), as compared to levels in the bare soil. In the 0-10 cm soil layer, the total N in bare soil was 298 +/- 1.48 mg/kg, but after planting LL, ZS or HS, the soil total N increased by 101%, 56% and 40%, respectively. Compared with that of the bare soil, cbbL sequencing showed that the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium increased and that of Bacillus decreased due to planting. Similarly, the nifH sequencing results indicated that the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium and Motiliproteu increased and that of Desulfuromonas and Geoalkalibacter decreased. These findings suggested that soil microorganisms could play a pivotal role in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of saline soils by influencing the content of soil carbon and nitrogen.

TI  - Antagonistic and additive interactions dominate the responses of belowground carbon-cycling processes to nitrogen and phosphorus additions
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - While responses of belowground carbon (C)-cycling processes to nutrient additions have been widely studied, how interactions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) influence belowground C-cycling processes are still unclear. By conducting a meta-analysis of 1928 observations from 158 independent experimental studies, we quantified the direction and magnitude of different interactions (i.e., additive, synergistic, and antagonistic) between N and P additions on eight variables related to belowground C pools and fluxes. The results showed that the interactions were antagonistic for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and heterotrophic respiration (Rh), and were additive for soil organic carbon (SOC), fungal biomass, and soil respiration (Rs). Synergistic interactions occurred less frequently than additive or antagonistic interactions, and were observed for bacterial and total microbial biomass (TPLFAs). Additive interactions dominated the responses of most belowground C pools and fluxes among different terrestrial ecosystems, whereas antagonistic interactions were found for DOC in subtropical forest, MBC in tropical/subtropical forest, SOC in cropland, and fungal/bacterial biomass in tundra. Synergistic interactions were rare and were found only for MBC in temperate forest and Rh in tropical forest and wetland. The responses of belowground C pools and fluxes to N and P additions were significantly dependent on environmental or experimental conditions. Our meta-analysis highlighted the importance of soil microbes in affecting belowground C-cycling processes, and identified some key interactions to be implemented into C-cycling models for predicting the impacts of increasing depositions of N and P on terrestrial C uptake in the future.

TI  - Effect of nitrogen fertilization on the abundance of nitrogen cycling genes in agricultural soils: A meta-analysis of field studies
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Quantification of functional genes involved in nitrogen (N) transformation improves our understanding of N cycling microbial population responses to environmental disturbance. Agricultural N fertilization affects N-cycling gene abundances in soil, but the general patterns and variability of N cycling gene abundances in response to N fertilization have yet to be synthesized. We conducted a meta-analysis comprising 47 field studies in agricultural ecosystems. We included five marker genes important to N-cycling: nifH (encoding nitrogenase; key enzyme for N fixation), amoA (encoding ammonia monooxygenase; key enzyme for nitrification), nirK and nirS (encoding nitrite reductase; key enzyme for denitrification), and nosZ (encoding nitrous oxide reductase; key enzyme for denitrification). We found that N fertilization had no effect on the abundance of nifH, but significantly increased archaeal amoA (31%), bacterial amoA (313%), nirK (53%), nirS (40%) and nosZ (75%), respectively. N fertilizer form (inorganic versus organic) strongly affected the response of most selected N cycling genes to N fertilization; organic fertilizers often had a much stronger effect than inorganic fertilizers. N fertilization duration, crop rotation, and soil pH were also important factors regulating the response of most N cycling genes to N fertilization. Genes involved in nitrification and denitrification were significantly correlated with each other. Improvement in understanding of the response of N-cycling gene abundance to enhanced N input will help develop quantitative models of N availability and N fluxes and improve strategies for reducing reactive N gas emissions and N management in agricultural ecosystems.

TI  - The Long-Term Application of Controlled-Release Nitrogen Fertilizer Maintains a More Stable Bacterial Community and Nitrogen Cycling Functions Than Common Urea in Fluvo-Aquic Soil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Controlled-release nitrogen fertilizer (CRNF) has been proven to surpass common urea by mitigating nutrient losses, enhancing soil quality, and improving crop productivity. However, the long-term effects of CRNF on soil biological properties are not well understood. Here, a 12-year field experiment was conducted with five treatments: no N fertilizer (PK); the split application of urea at the farmer's practice rate (FP) and the optimal rate (OPT); the one-time application of CRNF at the same rate as the OPT (CRNF); and a 20% reduced rate of the OPT (0.8CRNF). Soil samples were collected during the maize tasseling and filling stages; high-throughput sequencing and the PICRUSt2 method were employed to determine the bacterial community and its functional potential. The results showed that CRNF significantly increased alkaline hydrolysis N by 14.10% and 9.45% compared to OPT during the tasseling and filling stages, respectively. This increase in soil available N resulted in a significant increase in bacterial diversity of 2.09% and 2.35% compared with the FP and OPT, respectively. The bacterial community in the FP and OPT changed markedly between the tasseling and filling stages, with many bacterial species at the ASV and genus levels showing variations in relative abundance. In contrast, CRNF and 0.8CRNF exhibited stable N-cycling functions, as indicated by the lower variations in nitrate reductase and predicted N-cycling functional genes between the tasseling and filling stages. The obtained results suggest that CRNF application can enhance soil N supply, promote the formation of stable bacterial communities, and maintain stable N-cycling functions.

TI  - The temperature sensitivity of soil: microbial biodiversity, growth, and carbon mineralization
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Microorganisms drive soil carbon mineralization and changes in their activity with increased temperature could feedback to climate change. Variation in microbial biodiversity and the temperature sensitivities (Q(10)) of individual taxa may explain differences in the Q(10) of soil respiration, a possibility not previously examined due to methodological limitations. Here, we show phylogenetic and taxonomic variation in the Q(10) of growth (5-35 degrees C) among soil bacteria from four sites, one from each of Arctic, boreal, temperate, and tropical biomes. Differences in the temperature sensitivities of taxa and the taxonomic composition of communities determined community-assembled bacterial growth Q(10), which was strongly predictive of soil respiration Q(10) within and across biomes. Our results suggest community-assembled traits of microbial taxa may enable enhanced prediction of carbon cycling feedbacks to climate change in ecosystems across the globe.

TI  - Nitrite and nitrate reduction drive sediment microbial nitrogen cycling in a eutrophic lake
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - The anaerobic microbial nitrogen (N) removal in lake sediments is one of the most important processes driving the nitrogen cycling in lake ecosystems. However, the N removal and its underlying mechanisms regulated by denitrifying and anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) bacteria in lake sediments remain poorly understood. With the field sediments collected from different areas of Lake Donghu (a shallow eutrophic lake), we examined the denitrifying and anammox bacterial communities by sequencing the nirS/K and hzsB genes, respectively. The results indicated that denitrifiers in sediments were affiliated to nine clusters, which are involved in both het-erotrophic and autotrophic denitrification. However, anammox bacteria were only dominated by Candidatus Brocadia. We found that NO(3)(- )and NO2- concentrations, as well as Nar enzyme activity were the key factors affecting denitrifying and anammox communities in this eutrophic lake. The enrichment experiments in bio-reactors confirmed the divergence of denitrification and anammox rates with an additional complement of NO2?, especially under a condition low nitrate reductase activity. The coupled denitrification and anammox may play significant roles in N removal, and the availability of electronic acceptors (i.e., NO(2)(- )and NO3-) strongly influenced the N loss in lake sediments. Further path analysis indicated that NO2-, NO3- and some N-related enzymes were the key factors affecting microbial N removal in lake sediments. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms driving the of denitrification and anammox in lake sediments, which also provides new insights into coupled denitrification-anammox N removal in eutrophic lake ecosystems.

TI  - Structural and functional profile of phytases across the domains of life
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY
AB  - Phytase enzymes are a crucial component of the natural phosphorus cycle, as they help make phosphate bioavailable by releasing it from phytate, the primary reservoir of organic phosphorus in grain and soil. Phytases also comprise a significant segment of the agricultural enzyme market, used primarily as an animal feed additive. At least four structurally and mechanistically distinct classes of phytases have evolved in bacteria and eukaryotes, and the natural diversity of each class is explored here using advances in protein structure prediction and functional annotation. This graphical review aims to provide a succinct description of the major classes of phytase enzymes across phyla, including their structures, conserved motifs, and mechanisms of action.

TI  - Quantifying the role of termite decomposition in a mesic savanna
T2  - BIOTROPICA
AB  - Savanna systems are among the most sensitive to future climate and land-use change, yet we lack robust, direct quantifications of savanna carbon cycling. Together with fire, decomposition is the main process by which the carbon and nutrients are recycled and made available again to plants. Decomposition is largely mediated by microbes and soil invertebrates. Using a novel large-scale termite suppression experiment, we quantify, for the first time, the relative contribution of microbes, termites, and other invertebrates to the decomposition of wood (fresh native and dry non-native), dry dung, and grass in a mesic savanna. We found that termites were responsible for two thirds of the mass loss from dry wood and a third of the mass loss from fresh native wood, dry dung, and dry grass. Microbes were wholly responsible for the difference as there was no evidence of other invertebrates contributing to decomposition, even with fresh wood. Using multiple substrates in savanna decomposition studies is important where a mixture of contrasting life forms occur because both the rates of decomposition and the dominant agent varied considerably. In addition, including both a dry non-native and fresh native wood cast light on possible explanatory variables such as wood density, green-ness and the presence of bark, and the necessity of teasing these variables apart in future studies. Termites stand apart from all other insects in their impact on decomposition within savannas and should be acknowledged alongside microbes and fire as the primary agents of wood, grass, and dry dung turnover in global carbon models.
   Savanna ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate and land-use changes yet lack precise assessments of carbon cycling. In a large-scale termite suppression experiment, we found that termites accounted for two thirds of the mass loss from dry wood and a third of the mass loss from fresh native wood, dry dung, and dry grass. Understanding the precise contributions of termites, microbes, and fire is crucial for accurate global carbon models in savanna ecosystems.image

TI  - Intensive monocropping of bananas decreases the soil acid buffering capacity via ammonia-oxidizing bacteria
T2  - CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM) are vital for soil nitrogen cycling, nutrient availability, and soil health during sustainable agriculture. Long-term continuous cultivation of bananas and improper chemical fertilization affect the adaptability of AOM; however, the underlying basis for this phenomenon is unclear. This study utilized 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing techniques to examine soil from banana plantations that were continuously cultivated for 2, 3, 7, 10, 12, and 13 years (Y2, Y3, Y7, Y10, Y12, and Y13, respectively). The results indicated a significant decrease in soil acidity buffering capacity (pHBC) with increasing years of continuous cropping. Furthermore, compared with forest soil (Y0), Y7, Y10, Y12, and Y13 soils exhibited a significantly increased potential nitrification rate (PNR) as well as an abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), with no significant difference in complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox). Principal component analysis (PCA) further demonstrated marked differences in chemical properties and ammonia-oxidizing microbial community structures between the soils under long-term (Y7, Y10, Y12, Y13) and short-term (Y2, Y3) banana cultivation. In addition, metagenome analysis results indicated that the relative abundance of Nitrososphaera-AOA and Ca. Nitrosocosmicus-AOA as well as Nitrosospira-AOB, Nitrosovibrio-AOB, Nitrosomonas-AOB, and comammox Nitrospira jacus was significantly higher in Y7 and Y13 soils than in Y0 controls. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified pHBC, CEC, and NH4+ as the primary chemical factor responsible for the differences in AOM microbial communities, whereas random forest analysis revealed that Nitrosospira-AOB significantly contributed to PNR. In summary, long-term continuous banana cultivation primarily stimulates AOB promote soil ammonia oxidation, leading to soil acidification.

TI  - The speed of soil carbon throughput in an upland grassland is increased by liming
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB  - In situ C-13 pulse labelling was used to measure the temporal and spatial carbon flow through an upland grassland. The label was delivered as C-13-CO2 to vegetation in three replicate plots in each of two treatments: control and lime addition. Harvests occurred over a two month period and samples were taken along transects away from the label delivery area. The C-13 concentration of shoot, root, bulk soil, and soil-respired CO2 was measured. There was no difference in the biomass and C-13 concentration of shoot and root material for the control and lime treatments meaning that the amount of C-13-CO2 assimilated by the vegetation and translocated below ground was the same in both treatments. The C-13 concentration of the bulk soil was lower in the lime treatment than in the control and, conversely, the C-13 concentration of the soil-respired CO2 was higher in the lime. Unlike the difference in bulk soil C-13 concentration between treatments, the difference in the C-13 concentration of the soil-respired CO2 was obvious only at the delivery site and primarily within 1 d after labelling. An observed increase in the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in the lime treatment was a possible cause for this faster carbon throughput. The potential key role of mycorrhizas in the soil carbon cycle is discussed. The importance of a better understanding of soil processes, especially biological ones, in relation to the global carbon cycle and environmental change is highlighted.

TI  - Short-term impact of fire on the total soil microbial and nitrifier communities in a wet savanna
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Savannas are characterized by the coexistence of grasses and trees. Fires are critical for their coexistence, because they decrease the survival of tree seedlings and saplings and their recruitment to the adult stage. In some humid savannas, perennial grasses inhibit nitrification and trees stimulate nitrification, which likely favors coexistence between trees and grasses. However, fires may influence plant capacity to control nitrogen cycling, which could subsequently influence tree-grass coexistence and savanna nitrogen budget. Therefore, we sampled soil in a humid savanna of Ivory Coast under the dominant nitrification-inhibiting grass species and the dominant nitrification-stimulating tree species and under bare soil before and after (i.e., 5 days) fire during the long dry season. We quantified the total microbial and nitrifier abundances and transcriptional activities and the nitrification enzyme activity. Fire decreased soil water content, probably by increasing evaporation and, maybe, by triggering the growth of grasses, and increased soil ammonium availability likely due to ash deposition and increased mineralization. Fire did not impact the total archaeal, bacterial, or fungal abundances, or that of the nitrifiers. Fire did not impact archaeal transcriptional activity and increased bacterial and fungal total transcriptional activities. In contrast, fire decreased the archaeal nitrifier transcriptional activities and the nitrification enzymatic activity, likely due to the often reported resumption of the growth of nitrification-inhibiting grasses quickly after the fire (and the subsequent increase in root exudation). These results pave the way for a better understanding of the short-term effects of fire on nitrogen cycling and tree-grass competition for nitrogen.

TI  - Distributions, abundances and activities of microbes associated with the nitrogen cycle in riparian and stream sediments of a river tributary
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - River tributaries are ecologically important environments that function as sinks of inorganic nitrogen. To gain greater insight into the nitrogen cycle (N-cycle) in these environments, the distributions and activities of microbial populations involved in the N-cycle were studied in riparian and stream sediments of the Santa Fe River (SFR) tributaries located in northern Florida, USA. Riparian sediments were characterized by much higher organic matter content, and extracellular enzyme activities, including cellobiohydrolase, beta-D-glucosidase, and phenol oxidase than stream sediments. Compared with stream sediments, riparian sediments exhibited significantly higher activities of nitrification, denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) and anaerobic ammonia oxidation; correspondingly, with higher copies of amoA (a biomarker for enumerating nitrifiers), nirS and nirK (for denitrifiers), and nrfA (for DNRA bacteria). Among N-cycle processes, denitrification showed the highest activities and the highest concentrations of the corresponding gene (nirK and nirS) copy numbers. In riparian sediments, substantial nitrification activities (6.3 mg-N kg soil(-1)d(-1) average) and numbers of amoA copies (7.3 x 10(7) copies g soil(-1) average) were observed, and nitrification rates correlate with denitrification rates. The guild structures of denitrifiers and nitrifiers in riparian sediments differed significantly from those found in stream sediments, as revealed by analysis of nirS and archaeal amoA sequences. This study shows that riparian sediments serve as sinks for inorganic nitrogen loads from non-point sources of agricultural runoff, with nitrification and denitrification associated with elevated levels of carbon and nitrogen contents and extracellular enzyme activities.

TI  - Peatland Microbial Community Composition Is Driven by a Natural Climate Gradient
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Peatlands are important players in climate change-biosphere feedbacks via long-term net carbon (C) accumulation in soil organic matter and as potential net C sources including the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4). Interactions of climate, site-hydrology, plant community, and groundwater chemical factors influence peatland development and functioning, including C dioxide (CO2) and CH4 fluxes, but the role of microbial community composition is not well understood. To assess microbial functional and taxonomic dissimilarities, we used high throughput sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) to determine bacterial and archaeal community composition in soils from twenty North American peatlands. Targeted DNA metabarcoding showed that although Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla on average, intermediate and rich fens hosted greater diversity and taxonomic richness, as well as an array of candidate phyla when compared with acidic and nutrient-poor poor fens and bogs. Moreover, pH was revealed to be the strongest predictor of microbial community structure across sites. Predictive metagenome content (PICRUSt) showed increases in specific genes, such as purine/pyrimidine and amino-acid metabolism in mid-latitude peatlands from 38 to 45 degrees N, suggesting a shift toward utilization of microbial biomass over utilization of initial plant biomass in these microbial communities. Overall, there appears to be noticeable differences in community structure between peatland classes, as well as differences in microbial metabolic activity between latitudes. These findings are in line with a predicted increase in the decomposition and accelerated C turnover, and suggest that peatlands north of 37 degrees latitude may be particularly vulnerable to climate change.

TI  - Impact of plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) burrowing-induced microtopography on ecosystem respiration of the alpine meadow and steppe on the Tibetan plateau
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background Alpine ecosystem underlain by permafrost is considered as one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to disturbance, especially the alpine grassland on the Tibetan plateau with an altitude above 4000 m. Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) burrowing can create distinctive bare grounds and cause micro-topographical heterogeneity in alpine grasslands. The burrowing-induced changes in microtopography may directly alter plant and soil interactions as well as ecosystem carbon cycle, which have rarely been studied in Tibetan alpine grasslands. Methods To test the responses of ecosystem respiration (Re) to pika burrowing-induced changes in microtopography, we investigated plant characteristics, soil properties and Re from the bare grounds and vegetated grounds in the alpine meadow and steppe on the Tibetan Plateau. Results Our study showed that vegetation cover, species richness, plant biomass, soil moisture (SM), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (STN), soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) in the bare grounds were significantly lower than in the vegetated grounds in both alpine meadow and alpine steppe (P < 0.05). However, soil temperature and inorganic nitrogen tended to increase in the bare grounds. The growing season Re was significantly lower in the bare grounds than that in the vegetated grounds (P < 0.01). Pika burrowing had negative effects on Re and its temperature sensitivity in both alpine vegetations (P < 0.05). The relative changes in Re due to burrowing-induced changes in microtopography were positively correlated with the burrowing caused changes of AGB, BGB, SOC and MBC (P < 0.05). Pika burrowing-induced changes in soil temperature, soil moisture, plant biomass and microbial biomass are the major factors for the decrease of Re in the bare grounds. Conclusion In view of the large number of pika burrows in the alpine grasslands and the loss of soil organic carbon due to pika bioturbation, the impacts of pika burrowing-induced changes in microtopography on Re must be considered in predicting the carbon cycle in alpine grasslands.

TI  - Effects of organic perturbation on marine sediment betaproteobacterial ammonia oxidizers and on benthic nitrogen biogeochemistry
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - The failure of denitrification to remove nitrogen build-up from aquatic systems is often attributed to sediment chemical conditions inhibiting nitrification and therefore the supply of suitable substrates to be denitrified. We investigated the effects of organic fish farm pollution on nitrogen-cycle dynamics and betaproteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (beta-AOB) community structure to elucidate the potential role of the nitrifier community on nitrogen biogeochemistry in marine sediments. Porewater nitrogen concentrations, denitrification rates, (beta-AOB 16S rDNA gene quantification, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) community fingerprints and infaunal counts were determined in samples collected from beneath fish cages and at adjacent, non-impacted control sites. The study was conducted over 2 full, 1 yr production cycles. Although nitrogen cycling was significantly altered beneath cages, changes appeared to result from a reduction in the proportion of ammonia nitrified rather than from inhibition of nitrification per se. DGGE revealed beta-AOB communities shifted rapidly and remained diverse at both cage and reference sites. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed beta-AOB numbers did not decline in absolute terms but did decline as a proportion of the total bacterial community at cage sites and at the end of the stocking periods. Sediment infaunal community analysis showed significant effects of organic loading and indicated more bioirrigation at impacted sites. Despite the induction of conditions thought to be detrimental to nitrification and to beta-AOB (low oxygen, reduced sediments, low pH, and high sulphide concentrations), these communities remained diverse and apparently viable, perhaps a result of heavy sediment bioirrigation. However, despite the increase in denitrification, nitrogen left the sediment predominantly as ammonia, thus producing potential point sources of eutrophication.

TI  - Enchytraeids simultaneously stimulate rice straw degradation and mitigate CO2 release in a paddy soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The contribution of soil enchytraeids (potworms) to carbon cycling is often considered marginal and is therefore rarely quantified. In our experiment we aimed at evaluating the impact of the model enchytraeid species Enchytraeus buchholzi Vejdovsky, 1879 on rice straw degradation and associated CO2 release from soil. We filled 48 microcosms with soil collected in rice paddies of the Republic of Kalmykia, Russia, at 75% water holding capacity and added 0.5 g dry rice straw sealed in litterbags to each of them. Half of the microcosms were inoculated with 100 potworms. On days 3, 6, 9, 14, 21 and 31 after the start of the experiment, we measured CO2 emissions from soil. In addition, we terminated four microcosms with and four without enchytraeids at each of these dates to measure both rice straw mass loss and enchytraeid recovery rates. E. buchholzi significantly accelerated the relative rice straw mass loss (10.2 +/- 1.4 and 14.2 +/- 2.0%, respectively). It also significantly reduced CO2 emissions by 35% on average across the whole observation period. Though the number of potworms extracted dropped by 61% of the initial density up to day 9, it then consistently increased and reached a mean density of 365 individuals per microcosm at the end of the experiment. Considering both the rapid reproduction of E. buchholzi and the efficient mitigation of CO2 release, the promotion of enchytraeid activity may be a promising management measure for stabilizing carbon in paddy soils amended with rice straw. This opens up innovative perspectives for further research on exploiting the potential of the soil fauna for sustainable recycling of rice crop residues.

TI  - Bacteria in agricultural soils: Diversity, role and future perspectives
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Bacteria in soil are very diverse, very numerous, and functionally important, and have historically been an important object of research by Canadian microbiologists. Only a small fraction of bacteria in soils are amenable to culturing in the laboratory, limiting the ability to study these organisms. Canadian scientists have contributed to the development and implementation of both nucleic acid-based and chemical biomarker-based methods now widely used for assessing soil microbial biodiversity without the need for isolation and cultivation. Pesticide degradation, and the cycling of nitrogen in soils are used here to illustrate the significance of bacterial biodiversity to soil functions relevant to human and environmental health, and crop production. There remains much to be discovered about the genetic and functional biodiversity of soil bacteria, and much to be gained from this knowledge. A number of recommendations are made for future research in soil bacteriology.

TI  - High microbial diversity of the nitric oxide dismutation reaction revealed by PCR amplification and analysis of the nod gene
T2  - INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION
AB  - Microbial nitric oxide dismutation reaction (NOD), involved in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle on Earth, has been implemented to N removal in laboratory-scale wastewater treatment systems, but microorganisms from relatively a few lineages have been implicated to be associated with this biochemical process. Detection of abundant putative (or novel) nitric oxide dismutase-encoding gene PCR products could confer the diversity of nitric oxide dismutase in additional microbial groups other than the two known lineages, but the distribution pattern of nod gene is unclear in different environments including oil reservoirs. Here, we surveyed the distribution and diversity of nod genes by clone library sequencing together with the inference of 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomy by amplicon sequencing in diverse samples including wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), wetland, hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, and oil reservoirs. A total of 730 phylogenetically diverse nod-related sequences recovered from these samples were clustered into 42 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showing a considerably high diversity of nod gene in these different ecosystems. The abundance of nod gene in five environmental samples were similar to 1.80 x 10(7)-2.62 x 10(8) copies g(-1) soil (sludge) and similar to 9.67 x 10(6) copies l(-1) water. The dominant microorganisms were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Our results expanded significantly the diversity of microbial groups potentially involved in nitric oxide dismutation, suggesting the ubiquity of microbial members in the different ecosystems carrying out NO dismutation reaction. Further studies on the functional capacity of this new microbial group will advance a better understanding of the microbially-driven nitrogen cycling and provide thorough information on N-removal processes and potential applications.

TI  - Compost as a carrier for microplastics and plastic-bound toxic metals into agroecosystems
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & HEALTH
AB  - Research on microplastics (MPs) primarily focuses on the abundance in different ecosystems, ecotoxicology, and health aspects. The primary focus is now on structural and physicochemical changes in soil, ecotoxicology, and influence on plant growth performance. Compost is considered one of the prime sources of MPs in agricultural environments, where MPs in compost can influence the carbon cycle in copious ways, such as soil microbial processes, plant growth, or litter decomposition. Microplastics are reported in the range of 10-2800 item kg(-1) in compost from various countries. Most importantly, compost can be a carrier for MP-bound toxic trace metals into the agroecosystems. It has been identified that different toxic metals are associated with the MPs in compost, i.e. Cr, Pb, Cu and Ni; however, no considerable attention is given to the study of their concentrations, translocation, and fate. As the addition of MPs changes the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil, which leads to a change in toxic trace metal fractionation and partitioning, as reported in the literature. Importantly, future research needs to capture the toxic metal mobilization and immobilization in terms of chemistry, aging, size, aggregation, and shape of MPs.

TI  - Insights into CO2 and N2O emissions driven by applying biochar and nitrogen fertilizers in upland soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Biochar and soil carbon sequestration hold promise in mitigating global warming by storing carbon in the soil. However, the interaction between biochar properties, soil carbon-nitrogen cycling, and nitrogen fertilizer application's impact on soil carbon-nitrogen balance remained unclear. Herein, we conducted batch experiments to study the effects and mechanisms of rice straw biochar application (produced at 300, 500, and 700 degrees C) on net greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, 2 , N2O, 2 O, CH4) 4 ) in upland soils under different forms of nitrogen fertilizers. The findings revealed that (NH4)2SO4 4 ) 2 SO 4 and urea significantly elevated soil carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, ranging from 28 to 61.7 kg CO2e/ha 2 e /ha and 8.2 to 37.7 kg CO2e/ha, 2e /ha, respectively. Conversely, KNO3 3 reduced soil CO2e 2e emissions, ranging from 2.2 to 13.6 kg CO2e/ha. 2e /ha. However, none of these three nitrogen forms exhibited a significant effect on CH4 4 emissions. The pyrolysis temperature of biochar was found negatively correlated with soil CO2 2 and N2O 2 O emissions. The alkaline substances presented in biochar pyrolyzed at 500-700 degrees C raised soil pH, increased the ratio of Gram-negative to Gram-positive bacteria, and enhanced the relative abundance of Sphingomonadaceae. . Moreover, the co-application of KNO3 3 based nitrogen fertilizer and biochar increased the total carbon/inorganic nitrogen ratio and reduces the relative abundance of Nitrospirae. This series of reactions led to a significant increase in soil DOC content, meanwhile reduced soil CO2 2 emissions, and inhibited the nitrification process and decreased the emission of soil N2O. 2 O. This study provided a scientific basis for the rational application of biochar in soil.

TI  - Temporal variation in microbial and plant biomass during summer in a Mediterranean high-mountain dry grassland
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - We assessed the temporal changes on microbial biomass in relation to changes in soil moisture, dissolved organic carbon and plant biomass during the summer season in a Mediterranean high-mountain grassland.
   Temporal variations were tested by two-way ANOVA. The relationships among microbial biomass, plant biomass, soil water content, soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and total soil nitrogen during the summer season were assessed by means of structural equation modeling.
   Microbial biomass did not show variation, while dissolved organic carbon and root biomass decreased throughout the summer. Aboveground plant biomass peaked in the middle of the summer, when soil water content was at its minimum. Soil water content directly and negatively affected soil microbial biomass, and positively affected dissolved organic carbon. Moreover soil microbial biomass and dissolved organic carbon were negatively related. Plant biomass effects on soil microbial biomass were driven by root biomass, which indirectly affected soil microbial biomass through effects on soil organic carbon and soil nitrogen.
   The temporal dynamic of microbial biomass during the summer season appeared to differ from previous observations in temperate alpine communities, and indicated the drought resistance of the microbial community during the summer in Mediterranean high-mountain grasslands. During the dry period, microbial biomass may play an alternative role in soil carbon conservation.

TI  - Growing season warming and winter freeze-thaw cycles reduce root nitrogen uptake capacity and increase soil solution nitrogen in a northern forest ecosystem
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Northern forest ecosystems are projected to experience warmer growing seasons and increased soil freeze-thaw cycles in winter over the next century. Past studies show that warmer soils in the growing season enhance nitrogen uptake by plants, while soil freezing in winter reduces plant uptake and ecosystem retention of nitrogen, yet the combined effects of these changes on plant root capacity to take up nitrogen are unknown. We conducted a 2-year (2014-2015) experiment at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, USA to characterize the response of root damage, nitrogen uptake capacity, and soil solution nitrogen to growing season warming combined with soil freeze-thaw cycles in winter. Winter freeze-thaw cycles damaged roots, reduced nitrogen uptake capacity by 42%, and increased soil solution ammonium in the early growing season (May-June). During the peak growing season (July), root nitrogen uptake capacity was reduced 40% by warming alone and 49% by warming combined with freeze-thaw cycles. These results indicate the projected combination of colder soils in winter and warmer soils in the snow-free season will alter root function by reducing root nitrogen uptake capacity and lead to transient increases of nitrogen in soil solution during the early growing season, with the potential to alter root competition for soil nitrogen and seasonal patterns of soil nitrogen availability. We conclude that considering interactive effects of changes in climate during winter and the snow-free season is essential for accurate determination of the response of nitrogen cycling in the northern hardwood forest to climate change.

TI  - Urea fertilization and grass species alter microbial nitrogen cycling capacity and activity native C4 native grassland
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Soil microbial transformation of nitrogen (N) in nutrient-limited native C-4 grasslands can be affected by N fertilization rate and C-4 grass species. Here, we report in situ dynamics of the population size (gene copy abundances) and activity (transcript copy abundances) of five functional genes involved in soil N cycling (nifH, bacterial amoA, nirK, nirS, and nosZ) in a field experiment with two C-4 grass species (switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii)) under three N fertilization rates (0, 67, and 202 kg N ha(-1)). Diazotroph (nifH) abundance and activity were not affected by N fertilization rate nor grass species. However, moderate and high N fertilization promoted population size and activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB, quantified via amoA genes and transcripts) and nitrification potential. Moderate N fertilization increased abundances of nitrite-reducing bacterial genes (nirK and nirS) under switchgrass but decreased these genes under big bluestem. The activity of nitrous oxide reducing bacteria (nosZ transcripts) was also promoted by moderate N fertilization. In general, high N fertilization had a negative effect on N-cycling populations compared to moderate N addition. Compared to big bluestem, the soils planted with switchgrass had a greater population size of AOB and nitrite reducers. The significant interaction effects of sampling season, grass species, and N fertilization rate on N-cycling microbial community at genetic-level rather than transcriptional-level suggested the activity of N-cycling microbial communities may be driven by more complex environmental factors in native C-4 grass systems, such as climatic and edaphic factors.

TI  - Response of Community Characteristics and Assembly Mechanisms of cbbL-Carrier Carbon-Fixing Microorganisms to Precipitation Changes in Alpine Lakeshore Wetland
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Precipitation change strongly influences soil microbial communities, and precipitation patterns have become a key factor affecting carbon and nitrogen cycling processes in wetland ecosystems. The cbbL gene is a key gene in the fixation of carbon dioxide during the Calvin cycle. However, the response of cbbL-carrier carbon-fixing microorganisms in the lakeshore wetland to precipitation change remains unclear. To this end, we established 25% and 50% increased and decreased precipitation treatments, along with a natural control, and used high-throughput sequencing to investigate the response of the cbbL-carrier carbon-fixing microbial community in a lakeshore wetland of Qinghai Lake in response to precipitation change. The results showed that a 25% reduced precipitation treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Chlorophyta and Bradyrhizobium. pH was found to be the most important factor influencing the carbon-fixing microbial community, with a significant positive correlation with Ferrithrix. A 25% increased precipitation treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of aerobic chemoheterotrophy and chemoheterotrophy, while a 25% reduced precipitation treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of nitrogen fixation. The increased precipitation and 50% reduced precipitation treatments shift the community assembly process of cbbL-carrier carbon-fixing microorganisms from randomness to determinism. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that the network complexity and connectivity between species of cbbL-carrier carbon-fixing microorganisms initially decreased and then increased with increasing precipitation. In summary, precipitation change tended to reduce the carbon sequestration potential of the lakeshore wetland, while a 25% reduced precipitation treatment favored the nitrogen fixation process in these wetlands.

TI  - Manganese oxides in Phragmites rhizosphere accelerates ammonia oxidation in constructed wetlands
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - Phragmites reeds are widely used in constructed wetlands (CWs) for treating wastewater. The enrichment of microorganisms and Fe/Mn plaque in Phragmites rhizospheres largely contributes to pollutant removal. However, their interactions and potential synergistic roles in water purification are poorly understood. To address the issue, we first compared the microbial community traits in the Phragmites rhizosphere and adjacent bulk soil in six long-term operated CWs. Results showed that enriched microbes and functional genes in the Phragmites rhizosphere were largely involved in Mn oxidation, resulting in a two to three times enrichment of Mn oxides in the rhizosphere. In turn, the enriched Mn oxides played significant roles in driving microbial community composition and function. To further understand the biological manganese oxidation in the rhizosphere, we identified Mn-oxidizing bacteria using genome-centric analysis and found that 92% of identified Mn-oxidizing bacteria potentially participated in nitrogen cycling. We then conducted relationships between Mn-oxidizing genes and different nitrogen cycling genes and found Mn-oxidizing gene abundance was significantly corre-lated with ammonia oxidation gene amoA (R = 0.65). Remarkably, complete ammonia oxidation (comammox) Nitrospira, accounting for 39.11% of ammonia oxidizers, also positively correlated with Mn-oxidizing microbes. Based on the above observations, we inferred that the use of Mn oxides as a substrate in CWs may enhance ammonia oxidation. To apply this to actual engineering, we explored treatment performance in a pilot-scale Mn-amending CW. As expected, ammonia removal capacity improved by 23.34%, on average, in the Mn-amending CW. In addition, the abundance of amoA genes increased significantly in the Mn-amending CW, indicating improved biological processes rather than chemical reactions.

TI  - Rapid mineralization of biogenic volatile organic compounds in temperate and Arctic soils
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are produced by all life forms. Their release into the atmosphere is important with regards to a number of climate-related physical and chemical processes and great effort has been put into determining sources and sinks of these compounds in recent years. Soil microbes have been suggested as a possible sink for BVOCs in the atmosphere; however, experimental evidence for this sink is scarce despite its potentially high importance to both carbon cycling and atmospheric concentrations of these gases. We therefore conducted a study with a number of commonly occurring BVOCs labelled with C-14 and modified existing methods to study the mineralization of these compounds to (CO2)-C-14 in four different topsoils. Five of the six BVOCs were rapidly mineralized by microbes in all soils. However, great differences were observed with regards to the speed of mineralization, extent of mineralization and variation between soil types. Methanol, benzaldehyde, acetophenone and the oxygenated monoterpene geraniol were mineralized within hours in all soils. The hydrocarbon monoterpene p-cymene was mineralized rapidly in soil from a coniferous forest but was mineralized slower in soil from an adjacent beech stand, while chloroform was mineralized slowly in all soils. From our study it is clear that soil microbes are able to completely degrade BVOCs released by above-ground vegetation as well as BVOCs released by soil microbes and plant roots. In addition to the possible atmospheric implications of this degradation, the very fast mineralization rates are likely important in shaping the net BVOC emissions from soil and it is possible that BVOC formation and degradation may be important but little-recognized parts of internal carbon cycling in soil.

TI  - Effects of Polyethylene Microplastics and Phenanthrene on Soil Properties, Enzyme Activities and Bacterial Communities
T2  - PROCESSES
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pollution has received increasing concern due to their ubiquitous distribution and potential risks in soils. However, nothing is known about the influences of PAHs-MPs combined pollution on soil ecosystems. To address the knowledge gap, a 1-year soil microcosm experiment was conducted to systematically investigate the single and combined effect of polyethylene (PE)/phenanthrene (PHE) on soil chemical properties, enzymatic activities and bacterial communities (i.e., diversity, composition and function). Results showed that PE and PHE-PE significantly decreased soil pH. The available phosphorus (AP) and neutral phosphatase activity were not considerably changed by PHE, PE and PHE-PE. Significant enhancement of dehydrogenase activity in a PHE-PE amended system might be due to the degradation of PHE by indigenous bacteria (i.e., Sphingomonas, Sphingobium), and PE could enhance this stimulative effect. PHE and PHE-PE led to a slight increase in soil organic matter (SOM) and fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse) activity but a decrease in available nitrogen (AN) and urease activity. PE significantly enhanced the functions of nitrogen cycle and metabolism, reducing SOM/AN contents but increasing urease/FDAse activities. There were insignificant impacts on overall community diversity and composition in treated samples, although some bacterial genera were significantly stimulated or attenuated with treatments. In conclusion, the addition of PHE and PE influenced the soil chemical properties, enzymatic activities and bacterial community diversity/composition to some extent. The significantly positive effect of PE on the nitrogen cycle and on metabolic function might lead to the conspicuous alterations in SOM/AN contents and urease/FDAse activities. This study may provide new basic information for understanding the ecological risk of PAHs-MPs combined pollution in soils.

TI  - Postglacial Carbon Cycling History of a Northeastern Baffin Island Lake Catchment Inferred From Ramped Pyrolysis Oxidation and Radiocarbon Dating
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Anthropogenic warming in the Arctic has caused accelerated permafrost thaw, leading to the export of relict organic carbon (OC) to the atmosphere and surrounding depositional environments. Past episodes of warmth exceeding pre-industrial temperatures, such as the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; 11-8 ka at our study site), may serve as an analog for how the Arctic carbon cycle responds to ongoing warming. Here, we reconstructed accumulation rates of three OC endmembers (aquatic biomass, postglacial soil, and MIS 5 soil) in downcore sediments from Lake CF8, northeastern Baffin Island, during the 12.4 kyr since local deglaciation. We characterized endmembers and sediment mixtures using Ramped Pyrolysis/Oxidation (RPO), radiocarbon (14C) age offsets between bulk sediment and macrofossils, and stable carbon isotope ratios (delta 13C). We then modeled endmember contributions to the lake sediments using MixSIAR. RPO revealed similar patterns between OC volatilization and pyrolysis temperature indicating minimal OC degradation between endmembers and mixtures. MixSIAR-derived endmember accumulation rates showed that mean soil-derived OC inputs to Lake CF8 were proportionally greatest between 11.9 and 9.0 ka (5.2 +/- 1.9 g OC/m2/yr), 1.5 times greater than the rest of the record (3.4 +/- 1.5 g OC/m2/yr). This period coincided with regional rapid warming and peak Holocene summer temperatures. Since modern Arctic temperatures have already warmed by 2-3 degrees C, similar to the HTM, modern regional permafrost OC may be mobilized at the same rates that we estimate for that period.

TI  - Greater soil carbon stocks and faster turnover rates with increasing agricultural productivity
T2  - SOIL
AB  - Devising agricultural management schemes that enhance food security and soil carbon levels is a high priority for many nations. However, the coupling between agricultural productivity, soil carbon stocks and organic matter turnover rates is still unclear. Archived soil samples from four decades of a long-term crop rotation trial were analyzed for soil organic matter (SOM) cycling-relevant properties: C and N content, bulk composition by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, amino sugar content, short-term C bioavailability assays, and long-term C turnover rates by modeling the incorporation of the bomb spike in atmospheric C-14 into the soil. After >40 years under consistent management, topsoil carbon stocks ranged from 14 to 33 Mg C ha(-1) and were linearly related to the mean productivity of each treatment. Measurements of SOM composition demonstrated increasing amounts of plant- and microbially derived SOM along the productivity gradient. Under two modeling scenarios, radiocarbon data indicated overall SOM turnover time decreased from 40 to 13 years with increasing productivity - twice the rate of decline predicted from simple steady-state models or static three-pool decay rates of measured C pool distributions. Similarly, the half-life of synthetic root exudates decreased from 30.4 to 21.5 h with increasing productivity, indicating accelerated microbial activity. These findings suggest that there is a direct feedback between accelerated biological activity, carbon cycling rates and rates of carbon stabilization with important implications for how SOM dynamics are represented in models.

TI  - Effects of Soil Microbes on Forest Recovery to Climax Community through the Regulation of Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Microbes, as important regulators of ecosystem processes, play essential roles in ecosystem recovery after disturbances. However, it is not clear how soil microbial communities and functions change and affect forest recovery after clear-cutting. Here, we used metagenome sequencing to systematically analyse the differences in soil microbial community composition, functions, and nitrogen (N) cycling pathways between primary Korean pine forests (PF) and secondary broad-leaved forests (SF) formed after clear-cutting. Our results showed that the dominant phyla of the two forest types were consistent, but the relative abundance of some phyla was significantly different. Meanwhile, at the genus level, the fold-changes of rare genera were larger than the dominant and common genera. The genes related to microbial core metabolic functions, virulence factors, stress response, and defence were significantly enriched in SF. Additionally, based on the relative abundance of functional genes, a schema was proposed to analyse the differences in the whole N cycling processes between the two forest types. In PF, the stronger ammoniation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA) and the weaker nitrification provided a genetic explanation for PF dominated by ammonium (NH4+) rather than nitrate (NO3-). In SF, the weaker DNRA, the stronger nitrification and denitrification, the higher soil available phosphorus (AP), and the lower nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (N/P) comprehensively suggested that SF was faced with a greater degree of N limitation. These results offer insights into the potential relationship between soil microbes and forest recovery, and aid in implementing proper forestry management.

TI  - The role of soil microbial tests in ecological risk assessment: Differentiating between exposure and effects
T2  - HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT
AB  - The use of soil microorganisms in ecological risk assessment is hampered by an unclear dose-response relationship for most contaminants. Establishing dose-response curves for soil microbial communities requires that one have a clear estimate of exposure at the site of toxic action and a response free of confounding environmental factors. It is not clear what methods can estimate toxicant dose at the site of toxic action or determine microbial response to a toxicant. Pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) is one possible estimate of microbial toxicant exposure. The PICT hypothesis is that the tolerance of a microbial community is proportional to the in situ dose. This method automatically corrects for differences due to differences in soil physical-chemical variables between samples. Various components of the soil nitrogen cycle can act as microbial bioindicators of toxicant impacts. Estimating denitrification activity presents a number of advantages over other components of the nitrogen cycle. Denitrifying bacteria come fi-om a diversity of habitats, can be autotrophic or heterotrophic, and denitrification is a well-defined enzymatic system, which allows the use of molecular tools. Determining denitrification may be a good estimate of effects of toxicants on microbial communities. However, given the state of our ignorance regarding soil microbial community structure and function, redundant estimates of exposure and effect are necessary to adequately characterize the response of microbial communities to toxicants.

TI  - Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria-mediated remediation of glyphosate-contaminated tea plantation soils through restoration of nutrient cycling and microbial diversity
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum herbicide widely used in tea plantations worldwide, however, its excessive use has exerted significant negative impacts on soil ecology and tea plant growth. Therefore, effective ecological remediation strategies are urgently required. In this study, a three-year field experiment was conducted in a glyphosate-treated tea plantation soil, where a plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) compound inoculant was applied following herbicide treatment. Metagenomic analysis was further performed to evaluate the remediation efficacy of PGPR. The results demonstrated that PGPR application significantly increased soil pH and nutrient levels (e.g., organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and enhanced soil enzyme activities, including protease, urease, acid phosphatase. PGPR inoculation also restored microbial diversity, optimized community structure, and upregulated functional genes associated with carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling. Moreover, tea leaf quality was improved, as evidenced by an increase in amino acid content and a reduction in phenol-ammonia ratio. Overall, the introduction of PGPR effectively mitigated the adverse impacts of glyphosate, thereby improving soil health and tea quality. These findings indicate that PGPR represents an environmentally friendly bioremediation strategy capable of restoring glyphosate-contaminated tea plantation soils and its ecosystem functions, thereby underscoring its practical value and ecological significance for sustainable tea plantation management.

TI  - Identity of biocrust species and microbial communities drive the response of soil multifunctionality to simulated global change
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Increasing N inputs and changing rainfall regimes will lead to drastic changes in multiple ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition and gas exchange in dryland ecosystems. As fundamental components of drylands, biological soil crusts (biocrusts) play important roles in the regulation of responses of multiple ecosystem functions to global environmental changes. Biocrusts are home to highly functional microbial communities; however little is known on the role of microbial communities associated with different biocrust species in regulating the response of multiple ecosystem functions to global change. Here, we conducted a microcosm experiment to evaluate the roles of biocrust-forming lichens (Diploschistes thunbergianus, Psora crystallifera and Xanthoparmelia reptans) in mediating the effects of simulated changes in rainfall frequency and nitrogen (N) addition on soil multifunctionality involving nutrient availability, greenhouse gas flux and enzyme activities. The three biocrust species supported different levels of soil bacterial diversity, and specific community composition as revealed by MiSeq sequencing. Biocrust species always promoted multiple functions related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling compared to bare ground, with X. reptans having the highest effect on multifunctionality. Most importantly, the relative abundance of specific microbial communities associated with different lichen species modulates the response of multifunctionality to impacts of water frequency (negative) and N addition (positive). Our results suggest that biocrust species could regulate global change impacts on soil multifunctionality in drylands, although the strength and direction vary among the biocrust species. These findings highlight the importance of preserving biocrusts as hotspots of microbial genetic resources and ecosystem functioning in drylands.

TI  - Distinct influence of conventional and biodegradable microplastics on microbe-driving nitrogen cycling processes in soils and plastispheres as evaluated by metagenomic analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Plastic mulching is one of the large contributors to microplastic (MP) accumulation in agricultural landscapes. However, the effects of conventional (PE-MPs) and biodegradable MPs (BMPs) on microbial functional and genomic information encoding nitrogen (N) cycling have yet to be addressed. Here, a soil microcosmic experiment was conducted by adding PE-MPs and BMPs to a Mollisol at dosage of 5% (w/w) followed by incubation for 90 days. The soils and MPs were examined by metagenomics and genome binning methods. The results revealed that BMPs harbored rougher surfaces and induced stronger alterations in microbial functional and taxonomic profiles in the soil and plastisphere than PE-MPs. In comparison to their respective soils, the plastispheres of PEMPs and BMPs stimulated the processes of N fixation, N degradation and assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA) and reduced the gene abundances encoding nitrification and denitrification, in which BMPs induced stronger influences than PE-MPs. Ramlibacter mainly drove the differences in N cycling processes between the soils containing two types of MPs and was further enriched in the BMP plastisphere. Three high-quality genomes were identified as Ramlibacter stains with higher abundances in the plastisphere of BMP than that of PE-MP. These which were potentially attributed to their biosynthesis and the accumulation of soil NH4+-N. Taken together, our results highlight the genetic mechanisms of soil N bioavailability in the presence of biodegradable MPs, which have important implications for maintaining sustainable agriculture and controlling microplastic risk.

TI  - Stable Carbon Isotope Depletions in Lipid Biomarkers Suggest Subsurface Carbon Fixation in Lava Caves
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Lava caves, formed through basaltic volcanism, are accessible conduits into the shallow subsurface and the microbial life residing there. While evidence for this life is widespread, the level of dependence of these microbial communities on surface inputs, especially that of organic carbon (OC), is a persistent knowledge gap, with relevance to both terrestrial biogeochemistry and the characterization of lava caves as Mars analog environments. Here, we explore carbon cycling processes within lava caves at Lava Beds National Monument, CA. We interrogate a range of cave features and surface soils, characterizing the isotopic composition (delta C-13) of bulk organic and inorganic phases, followed by organic geochemical analysis of the distribution and delta C-13 signatures of fatty acids derived from intact polar lipids (IPLs). From these data, we estimate the carbon sources of different sample types, finding that surface soils and mineral-rich speleothems incorporate plant-derived biomass (delta C-13(VPDB) similar to -30 parts per thousand), whereas biofilms are dominated by strongly C-13-depleted lipids (minimum delta C-13(VPDB) -45.4 parts per thousand) specific to bacteria, requiring a significant proportion of their biomass to derive from in situ fixation of inorganic carbon from previously respired OC. Based on the prevalence and abundance of these C-13-depleted lipids, we conclude that biofilms here are fueled by in situ chemolithoautotrophy, despite relatively high concentrations of dissolved OC in colocated cave waters. This unexpected metabolic potential mirrors that found in other deep subsurface biospheres and has significant positive implications for the potential microbial habitability of the Martian subsurface.

TI  - Neem oil based nanopesticide as an environmentally-friendly formulation for applications in sustainable agriculture: An ecotoxicological perspective
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Sustainable agriculture encourages practices that present low risks to the environment and human health. To this end, zein (corn protein) can be used to develop nanocanier systems capable of improving the physicochemical properties of biopesticides, reducing their possible toxicity. Neem oil extracted from the Azadiraclua indica tree contains many active ingredients including azadirachtin, which is the active ingredient in multiple commercially available biopesticides. In this study, we describe the preparation and characterization of neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles, together with evaluation of their toxicity towards nontarget organisms, using Allium cepa, soil nitrogen cycle microbiota, and Caenorhabditis elegans aiming to achieve the safer by design strategy. the spherical nanoparticles showed an average diameter of 278 +/- 61.5 nm and a good stability during the experiments. In the toxicity assays with A. cepa, the neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles mitigated the increase in the DNA relative damage index caused by the neem oil. Molecular genetic analysis of the soil nitrogen cycle microbiota revealed that neem oilloaded zein nanoparticles did not change the number of genes which encode nitrogen-fixing enzymes and denitrifying enzymes. In C. elegans, the neem oil-loaded win nanoparticles had no toxic effect, while neem oil interfered with pharyngeal pumping and GST-4 protein expression. These neem oil-loaded zein nanoparticles showed promising results in the toxicity studies, opening perspectives for its use in crop protection in organic agriculture. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dynamics of nitrogen mineralization and nitrogen cycling functional genes in response to soil pore size distribution
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil pore distribution influences the permeability of gas, water, and solutes, affecting microbial activities such as nitrogen (N) mineralization. Understanding its impact on N mineralization and the subsequent N transformations is essential for managing compacted paddy soils. This study conducted incubation experiments on two paddy soils from typical Chinese rice regions, Northeastern meadow chernozemic Mollisols, and Southern umbric Ferralsols, under three bulk densities (1.0 g cm(-3), 1.2 g cm(-3), and 1.4 g cm(-3)) to investigate the effects of soil porosity on N mineralization and N cycling functional genes. Although the cumulative mineralized N showed no significant difference, with increased macropores (>100 mu m) and mesopores (30-100 mu m), Ferralsols exhibited a significantly higher net N mineralization rate from day 0 to day 7, while Mollisols extended the mineralization after day 21. Soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC) had a similar temporal trend to the net N mineralization rate, suggesting DOC was the product of mineralization. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) showed an opposite temporal trend to the net N mineralization rate in Mollisols, suggesting microbial biomass as a key N source for mineralization. Soil pores distribution did not affect nitrification under waterlogged conditions, but it affected nirK, nirS and nosZ genes by altering redox potential and substrates availability in the pore micro-environment. Overall, soil pores over 30 mu m were the key pore size ranges affecting the intensity and duration of N mineralization, with different effects on DOC, MBC, and N cycling functional genes in Mollisols and Ferralsols. These findings emphasized the role of pore size in regulating N transformation in waterlogged conditions, contributing to the understanding of the N availability in compacted paddy soils from typical geographic rice-growing regions.

TI  - Conversion to agroforestry and monoculture plantation is detrimental to the soil carbon and nitrogen cycles and microbial communities of a rainforest
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The conversion of rainforests to plantations leads to about 50% loss in the organic carbon (C) content of the soil and strongly influences nitrogen (N) cycling, potentially increasing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the effect of land-use change in forests on the microbial communities responsible for C and N cycling processes remains poorly understood. This study quantified C and N fractions of soil organic matter in a tropical forest, rubber agroforestry system, 5- and 15-year-old rubber plantations. The community structure and abundance of fungi and bacteria were studied using high-throughput sequencing and q-PCR. Forest conversion substantially altered community structure and abundance of microbial communities. Rainforest conversion to plantation enhanced bacterial diversity and reduced the soil C mineralization rate. In addition, land-use change also enhanced the soil N mineralization rate in 5-year-old rubber plantation and agroforestry system. A structural equation modelling suggested that soil microbial communities played more dominant roles in driving the shift in C and N cycles caused by land-use change than soil C and N pools. These mechanistic insights into the differential control of soil fungal and bacterial communities on C and N mineralization has implications for managing land-use changes in tropical forest ecosystems.

TI  - Grapevine rootstock genotypes shape the functional composition of phyllosphere microbiome
T2  - SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE
AB  - The impact of rootstock selection and grafting on grapevines has been extensively studied, yet the influence on microbial functions in plant-associated environments remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of rootstock genotypes on the grapevine microbiome in both the below-ground rhizosphere and the aboveground phyllosphere using metagenomic sequencing. Rootstock genotypes significantly influence the diversity and composition of prokaryotic taxa in rhizosphere soil. Conversely, shotgun sequencing reveals that rootstock genotypes have no impact on the taxonomic composition of the phyllosphere microbiome, although the functional gene composition does vary. In total, 252 microbial genes across 31 biogeochemical pathways were identified from the metagenomic sequences of the phyllosphere microbiome. Notably, phosphorus-cycling pathways involving purine and pyruvate metabolism showed distinct compositions among grapevine rootstock genotypes. The 25 microbial genes involved in purine and pyruvate metabolism were attributed to 482 microbial genera, with four archaeal and four Firmicutes genera each harboring no fewer than 10 genes. Additionally, the read counts of purine metabolism were significantly associated with leaf nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Our findings highlight the importance of rootstock selection in shaping the microbial functional composition in the grapevine phyllosphere, underscoring potential avenues for precision viticulture strategies that leverage microbiome management.

TI  - Responses of soil respiration and microbial activity in Phragmites australis and Spartina alterniflora marshes to hydrological changes
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Coastal wetlands face unprecedented challenges from sea-level rise; however, the effects of increased waterlogging and salinity on soil respiration remain unclear, particularly given the contrasting stress tolerance strategies of dominant marsh species such as native Phragmites australis and invasive Spartina alterniflora. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to compare soil respiration responses to waterlogging (control: low water level; treatment: high water level) and salinity (control: 0 ppt; treatments: 5, 15, and 30 ppt) between these two species, while also examining the underlying mechanisms and the role of drainage. Under waterlogged conditions, high water levels significantly suppressed soil respiration, with P. australis exhibiting a greater reduction than S. alterniflora (78.9 % vs. 74.4 %). The species showed distinct responses to salinity: high salinity (30 ppt) caused a more pronounced reduction in P. australis than in S. alterniflora (56.4 % vs. 28.9 %). Drainage conditions fundamentally altered these responses; P. australis showed a greater post-drainage enhancement under high water level (42.4 % vs. 12.9 %) but consistently exhibited higher sensitivity to salinity. These species-specific responses were mediated by differential changes in root biomass, microbial biomass carbon, and carbon-cycling enzyme activities. Principal component analysis revealed clear ecological niche separation along the stress gradients, with S. alterniflora maintaining higher biological activity and P. australis displaying greater stress sensitivity under severe combined conditions. The combined effects of waterlogging and salinity revealed non-additive impacts on soil respiration, with S. alterniflora demonstrating superior tolerance through sustained microbial activity and root functioning. Our findings underscore the importance of considering species-specific adaptive strategies and tidal dynamics when predicting coastal wetland carbon cycling under future sea-level rise scenarios, as the differential stress responses of these ecologically significant species may substantially influence ecosystem carbon dynamics.

TI  - Spartina alterniflora invasion altered soil greenhouse gas emissions via affecting labile organic carbon in a coastal wetland
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Coastal wetlands are vital carbon repositories with a substantial soil carbon storage potential; as such, they play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration and climate regulation. The most invasive species in the global coastal zone, Spartina alterniflora, has significantly affected the ecosystem functions and nutrient cycling of coastal wetlands. However, it is uncertain how S. alterniflora invasion affects the driving mechanism of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by causing changes in the soil labile organic carbon (LOC) pool. Therefore, we investigated the mediating role of soil LOC in influencing the impact of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil GHG emissions. Our study was conducted in the coastal wetlands of the Dongtai Tiaozini Wetland Reserve in Yancheng, China. The relationship between variations in soil LOC components and GHG emissions in coastal wetlands was analyzed by measuring these variables across areas with high, moderate, and no invasion of S. alterniflora. The results showed that as the degree of invasion intensified, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and the global warming potential (GWP) showed significant increasing trends, while methane (CH4) emissions tended to increase first and then decrease. Compared with CO2 emissions in the non-invasive plots of S. alterniflora, CO2 emissions in moderately and highly invasive plots increased by 166.68 % and 403.35 %, respectively (P < 0.05). Similarly, N2O emissions increased by 34.67 % and 303.03 %, respectively (P < 0.01), and the GWP increased by 683.87 % and 947.32 %, respectively (P < 0.01). For CH4 emissions, moderate invasion represented a carbon source, and high invasion represented a carbon sink. The findings indicated that S. alterniflora invasion alters GHG emissions by modifying the soil LOC components and the ratio of LOC to soil organic carbon. These results provide a robust data foundation for understanding changes in carbon cycling and predicting feedback mechanisms on climate change in the context of S. alterniflora invasions in coastal wetlands.

TI  - Earthworm invasion and interaction with litter increased CO2 and N2O emissions in Changbai Mountain: A microcosm study
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Climate change is changing the elevational pattern of soil fauna in the mountain system, leading to their upward invasion process. Earthworm invasion activity contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and soil nutrients. However, the effect of earthworm invasion on gas emission, and the contributions of interaction with litter have not been clearly understood. In this study, we conducted a microcosm study of soil samples collected from four vegetation zones in Changbai Mountain to determine the effect of earthworms, litter, and their interactions on soil CO2 and N2O emissions. Soil samples were incubated in the laboratory at the average soil temperature in each vegetation zone during summer for 71 days. Our findings indicate that the CO2 gas emission rate (RCO2) first increased and then decreased, whereas the N2O gas emission rate (RN2O) decreased with increasing elevation. During the microcosm study, the addition of litter decelerated the rate of decline in earthworm biomass. Earthworm-, litter-, and the interactions-induced RCO2 increased by 19.7-44.2 %, 72.8-96.3 %, and 104.1-131.6 %, respectively. Litter-induced (SL and SLE) RN2O was higher (1.24-10 and 5.5-16 times) compared to S except in coniferous and broad-leaved forests, with SLE showing the highest values (0.11-1.23 mu g kg- 1 h- 1). The impacts of earthworms and litter on greenhouse gases were not a simple additive effect. Environmental factors explained 35.34 % and 42.83 % of the total variations in RCO2 and RN2O emissions, respectively, in which NO3 --N contributed the largest variations. Piecewise structural equation modeling (SEM) results underscored the interplay between elevation, earthworms, litter, and soil properties in affecting soil CO2 and N2O emissions. Earthworms, litter, and their interactions could affect CO2 and N2O emissions, and these variations were predominantly controlled by environmental factors. Our study provides valuable insights into how litter input and earthworm invasion influence soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. With the background of global climate change, the synergistic response of soil fauna invasion and greenhouse gas emissions to warming be an integral part of future risk assessment, and that to evaluate soil process, both the soil fauna and environmental factors must be taken into account.

TI  - Biological denitrification inhibition (BDI) on nine contrasting soils: An unexpected link with the initial soil denitrifying community
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Denitrification is considered the major pathway leading to soil gaseous (N) losses, affecting N availability for plants and consequently plant productivity. Biological denitrification inhibition (BDI) in Fallopia spp., a plant species complex with a high level of growth and competitiveness for mineral N, acts through procyanidin production. However, the soil factors governing BDI development are still unknown. Through a mesocosm experiment using two treatments - soil planted with Fallopia japonica and unplanted-, nine biologically and physically contrasting soils were studied with the aim to ascertain how each can affect BDI development. Microbial enzyme activities (respiration - SIR, denitrification - DEA), denitrifying functional gene abundance (nirK, nirS), total bacterial community abundance (rRNA 16S) and soil physicochemical parameters (N mineral forms, soil texture, moisture, pH) were measured before and after plant growth, and the DEA:SIR ratio was used as a BDI proxy. The DEA:SIR ratio decreased for six soils. BDI development is related to a small number of soil factors, mainly initial soil moisture and ammonium concentration, and unexpectedly, with the initial abundance of nirK(in), nirS(in) and rRNA 16S(in). The intensity of this decrease is positively correlated to the level of DEA in unplanted soil: the higher the DEA in unplanted soil, the more intense the BDI under F. japonica. The procyanidin concentration of the F. japonica belowground system was positively correlated to BDI intensity. These results suggest that a procyanidin assay from the plant belowground system could be a new proxy for measuring BDI intensity. Interestingly, this research shows that BDI is not systematic, and that few (a)biotic soil parameters influence its development. More importantly, this research is the first to highlight that biotic factors are relevant in explaining BDI. This paper also presents new perspectives on plant-microorganism interactions in terms of plant awareness of the soil microbial community.

TI  - Ecoenzymatic stoichiometry reflects the regulation of microbial carbon and nitrogen limitation on soil nitrogen cycling potential in arid agriculture ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - Purpose Water and nutrient availability are critical factors that affect soil biological processes in agroecological systems, which are regulated by extracellular ecoenzymatic activity; however, the response of these enzymes to water and nutrient levels is poorly understood. Methods A 4-year field experiment with three levels of irrigation (high, 400 mm; medium, 300 mm; and low, 200 mm) and two levels of fertilization (high, 600 kg/ha P2O5 + 300 kg/ha urea; and low, 300 kg/ha P2O5 + 150 kg/ha urea) was conducted to investigate the microbial metabolic status in an arid agroecological system in China using the model of extracellular enzymatic stoichiometry. Results Higher C-acquisition enzyme activity and lower N-acquisition enzyme activity were observed during the crop growth stage, suggesting promoted C limitation and alleviated N limitation for microbes by the combination of medium irrigation and low fertilization. Increased microbial C limitation surged the abundance of amoA-AOA and amoA-AOB genes involved in nitrification and strengthened this process. Decreased microbial N limitation hindered the denitrification potential by reducing the abundance of the involved nirK, nirS, nosZ, and narG genes. Increased microbial C limitation was due to the elevated soil water content, which further promoted the activity of C-acquiring enzymes and facilitated microbial decomposition of organic matter. The decreased microbial N limitation was largely related to the increased soil N availability. Conclusions These findings suggest that a combination of medium irrigation and low fertilization is effective for organic matter decomposition, by promoting microbial C metabolism and reducing the risk of N loss via alleviation of microbial N limitation. Our results emphasize the roles of stoichiometry-regulated microbial metabolism in soil nutrient transformation and have implications for agricultural practices in arid fertigation agroecosystems.

AB  - Microbial contribution to carbon and nitrogen cycling in forest soils is important, and may depend on tree species. The amount of amino sugars and their ratios can serve as reliable indicators for bacterial and fungal contribution. We compare forest floor microbial residues (amino sugars) beneath three canopy-tree species (Sugar Maple (SM), Acer saccharum Marsh; Basswood (BA), Tilia americana L.; Eastern Hemlock, Tsuga canadensis L.) replicated in five plots in an upper Michigan old-growth forest. We hypothesized that because individual tree species develop a unique microbial community over time, they will accumulate microbial residues to different degrees. In this study at three tree species sites, the absolute amount of fungal residue (glucosamine (GluN)) was relatively constant, while absolute quantities of bacterial residues (galactosamine (GalN) and muramic acid (MurA)) were least in the Hemlock site. Amino sugar ratios revealed that microbial residues were compositionally distinct in the three sites. The lower ratios of GluN to GalN and GluN to MurA in BA and SM sites relative to Hemlock site indicate the lower net accumulations of GalN and MurA in Hemlock site. In terms of microbial contribution to carbon and nitrogen cycle in forest soils, we suggest that caution may be needed when using amino sugars as a tool, especially for nitrogen pool assessment, as the amino sugars are diluted by plant-derived litter. This study provides information on the microbial residues in undisturbed forest soils which may assist interpretation of data derived from managed or damaged forests in the future.

TI  - Effects of Long-Term and Short-Term Droughts on the Hydrolytic Enzymes in Haplic Luvisol
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - The transformation of organic matter in the soil is largely determined by hydrolytic enzymes. Under the conditions of climate change, understanding the mechanisms of microbial response is of particular importance for predicting the carbon cycle. Until now, the effect of drought duration and frequency on soil hydrolytic enzymes has been little studied. A multifactorial field manipulation experiment was carried out, simulating in the presence of plants and without them: two short-term droughts, a long-term drought, and an optimal level of soil moisture. The maximum reaction rate V-max, Michaelis constant K-m, and catalytic efficiency K-a of five groups of enzymes involved in the carbon cycle (cellobiase, glucosidase, xylanase), phosphorus (phosphatase), and nitrogen (chitinase) were determined. In phosphatases, glucosidases, and xylanases, V-max decreased during short-term drought. During prolonged drought, the V-max value of phosphatases, cellobiohydrolases, and xylanases decreased and increased in chitinases, while remaining unchanged in glucosidases. Both long-term and short-term droughts led to an increase in K-m and a decrease in catalytic efficiency (K-a) for almost all enzymes. Short-term droughts were not a "weakened version" of a long-term drought, but had their own specifics-a decrease in K-m of glucosidases, which led to an increase in K-a. Long-term drought was characterized by an increase in V-max of chitinases and spatial variability of V-max of phosphatases and glucosidases. The influence of the presence of plants was secondary and manifested itself only during short droughts. The reversibility of the effect of drought on V-max, K-m, and K-a decreased in the series first short-term drought > second short-term drought > long-term drought due to an increase in the total duration of the stress impact.

TI  - Vertical distribution of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in the hyporheic zone of a eutrophic river in North China
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Nitrification plays a significant role in the global nitrogen cycle, and this concept has been challenged with the discovery of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in the environment. In this paper, the vertical variations of the diversity and abundance of AOA in the hyporheic zone of the Fuyang River in North China were investigated by molecular techniques, including clone libraries, phylogenetic analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The archaeal amoA gene was detected in all sediments along the profile, and all AOA fell within marine group 1.1a and soil group1.1b of the Thaumarchaeota phylum, with the latter being the dominant type. The diversity of AOA decreased with the sediment depth, and there was a shift in AOA community between top-sediments (0-5 cm) and sub-sediments (5-70 cm). The abundance of the archaeal amoA gene (1.48 x 10(7) to 5.50 x 10(7) copies g(-1) dry sediment) was higher than that of the bacterial amoA gene (4.01 x 10(4) to 1.75 x 10(5) copies g(-1) dry sediment) in sub-sediments, resulting in a log(10) ratio of AOA to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) from 2.27 to 2.69, whereas AOB outnumbered AOA in top-sediments with a low log(10) ratio of (-0.24). The variations in the AOA community were primarily attributed to the combined effect of the nutrients (ammonium-N, nitrate-N and total organic carbon) and oxygen in sediments. Ammonium-N was the major factor influencing the relative abundance of AOA and AOB, although other factors, such as total organic carbon, were involved. This study helps elucidate the roles of AOA and AOB in the nitrogen cycling of hyporheic zone.

TI  - Plant Phylogeny and Life History Shape Rhizosphere Bacterial Microbiome of Summer Annuals in an Agricultural Field
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Rhizosphere microbial communities are critically important for soil nitrogen cycling and plant productivity. There is evidence that plant species and genotypes select distinct rhizosphere communities, however, knowledge of the drivers and extent of this variation remains limited. We grew 11 annual species and 11 maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) inbred lines in a common garden experiment to assess the influence of host phylogeny, growth, and nitrogen metabolism on rhizosphere communities. Growth characteristics, bacterial community composition and potential activity of extracellular enzymes were assayed at time of flowering, when plant nitrogen demand is maximal. Bacterial community composition varied significantly between different plant species and genotypes. Rhizosphere beta-diversity was positively correlated with phylogenetic distance between plant species, but not genetic distance within a plant species. In particular, life history traits associated with plant resource acquisition (e.g., longer lifespan, high nitrogen use efficiency, and larger seed size) were correlated with variation in bacterial community composition and enzyme activity. These results indicate that plant evolutionary history and life history strategy influence rhizosphere bacterial community composition and activity. Thus, incorporating phylogenetic or functional diversity into crop rotations may be a tool to manipulate plant-microbe interactions in agricultural systems.

TI  - Microbial Enzyme Activities Drive CO2 and CH4 Emissions During Freeze-Thaw Cycles in Peatlands
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Climate change is projected to intensify freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) in the peatlands of Changbai Mountain, influencing soil biogeochemistry and carbon cycling. In order to elucidate microbial regulation of carbon emissions during FTCs, we performed controlled laboratory simulations using soils from a peatland in the Changbai Mountains, Northeast China. Our findings indicate that after 15 FTCs with small (-5 degrees C to 5 degrees C) and large amplitudes (-10 degrees C to 10 degrees C), the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission rates from surface soils declined by 63.8% and 64.2%, respectively, compared to the constant-temperature control; in deeper soils, the respective declines were 27.5% and 50.9%. We found that oxidase activities were negatively correlated with CO2 emissions during FTCs and served as the primary driver of these emissions. Methane (CH4) was oxidized during FTCs, with oxidation rates inversely related to FTC amplitude and greater under small amplitude than large amplitude conditions. Soil hydrolase activities were negatively correlated with CH4 oxidation rates, functioning as the primary regulators of methane oxidation. The carbon emissions were subsequently influenced by microbial phospholipid fatty acids, which modulated enzyme activities. This investigation comprehensively explores the interactive effects of soil enzymes, organic carbon fractions, and microbial community composition on carbon emissions. The results underscore the central role of soil enzymes in mediating these processes. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the microbial mechanisms governing greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands during FTCs.

TI  - Co-application of cadmium-immobilizing bacteria and organic fertilizers alter the wheat root soil chemistry and microbial communities
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Cadmium contamination poses a significant risk to soil ecosystems in certain parts of the world. Using ecofriendly fertilizers alongside beneficial microorganisms offers a viable solution to mitigate Cd pollution in agricultural soil. This study used an outdoor experiment to evaluate the impact of administering a Cdimmobilizing bacterial (Bacillus) inoculant with two biologically-enriched organic fertilizers (either fermentative edible fungi residue or fermented cow dung) on wheat plants and associated microbial populations in a field contaminated with Cd. The mixed application of fermentative cow dung with the Cd-immobilizing bacterium reduced the effective Cd content of wheat root-soil by 13,0 %. Application of Cd-immobilizing Bacillus inoculant reduced the Cd enrichment of wheat roots by 0.07 mg/kg. Co-application of fermentative cow dung with the bacterial inoculant reduced the Cd enrichment of wheat seeds by 20,0 %. Co-application of the two organic fertilizers could improve some of the nutrients related to wheat and soil fertility; however, the diversity of the soil microbial community changed less and its species richness decreased. Applying the Bacillus inoculant inhibited the growth of native pathogenic bacteria, such as Proteobacteria. Whether administering it with either fermented cow manure or fermented edible fungus residue, the relative abundance of nitrate-reducing bacteria such as Rhodobacter increased, which should promote the soil nitrogen cycle. The main factors influencing soil microbial community structure of wheat plants were pH, available potassium, and available Cd content. Symbiotic network analysis revealed bacterial inoculant and organic fertilizer inoculum further altering the ecological relationships of microbial communities. According to the FAPROTAX functional prediction, Rhodanobacter may play a key role in nitrate respiration in the soil nitrogen cycle. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive, timely reference for understanding microbial changes caused by the combined application of this type of bacterial inoculant and organic soil amendments in Cd-contaminated fields.

TI  - Effects of litter species and genetic diversity on plant litter decomposition in coastal wetland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - With the enhancement of carbon sink capacity and the intensification of biodiversity change in coastal wetlands, previous studies have well studied the relationship between species diversity and litter decomposition, a vital process of carbon cycling. However, previous studies ignored the importance of genetic diversity, which restricted our comprehensive understanding of the effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functions. Here, we manipulated different richness levels with litters of eight common species of coastal wetland plants and eight different genotypes of common reed (Phragmites australis) to explore the effects of species and genetic diversity on litter decomposition. We found the litter mass loss of mixtures was significantly lower than the average mass loss of single litters (ANOVA, p < 0.05), suggesting higher species and genetic diversity had negative effects on plant litter decomposition. The negative effects were also supported by the t-test that the observed mass loss was significantly lower than expected at both species and genetic diversity levels, which also identified that antagonistic effects occurred. In addition, the functional diversity of initial litter qualities, such as lignin content and the C/P ratio, had a significant correlation with the negative effects at species and genetic levels, whereas phylogenetic diversity did not reveal such a correlation, implying functional diversity might better predict the effects of diversity changes on litter decomposition in coastal wetlands at both species and genetic levels. Furthermore, the presence of specific species or genotype litters, such as Scorzonera mongolica, Imperata cylindrica and the common reed numbered CN2026, could also predict negative effects. In this study, we found that genetic diversity influenced litter decomposition as much as species diversity, and we provided significant implications for predicting the effect of wetland biodiversity loss or conservation on carbon sink capacity.

TI  - Changes in soil microbial functions involved in the carbon cycle response to conventional and biodegradable microplastics
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Biodegradable mulch film has become an encouraging alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastic, but it is likely to generate more microplastics (MPs) than conventional films with lower resistance and thus profoundly affects the soil environment. However, the effects of biodegradable (BMPs) and conventional polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) on soil microbial carbon (C) cycle remain unclear. Here, metagenomic sequencing was used to investigate microbial functional and relative taxonomic traits in response to PE-MP and BMP addition (5 % w/w) via a soil microcosm experiment. The results showed that the presence of BMPs, rather than PE-MPs, significantly changed soil microbial C cycling patterns at the functional and taxonomic levels. In soils, BMP addition significantly increased the abundances of genes regulating aerobic respiration, C decomposition (intracellular), C fixation, fermentation and CO oxidation pathways compared to those in the control and PE-MP added soils. Specifically, BMPs promoted soil starch and PHA (liable C) degradation, acetate and ethanol fermentation, Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3HP/4HB) associated with C fixation. Most of these C cycling pathways were further strengthened in the microplastisphere of BMPs. Furthermore, MPs selectively enriched specific taxa on their surface and subsequently increased their abundance in soils; Bradyrhizobium, Ramlibacter and Variovorax (enriched by BMPs) positively regulated labile C degradation, and Amycolatopsis and Nocardia (enriched by PE-MPs) promoted recalcitrant C degradation. Moreover, Pseudonocardia and Variovorax that were enriched by BMPs improved C dissimilation and assimilation by regulating fermentation and C fixation processes, respectively. Taken together, these results improve the understanding of the influence of conventional and biodegradable MPs on soil C cycling pathways and related microbial communities, highlighting that the presence of BMPs rather than PE-MPs accelerates soil C turnover.

TI  - Co-inoculation with Bacillus thuringiensis RZ2MS9 and rhizobia improves the soybean development and modulates soil functional diversity
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Despite the beneficial effects of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria on agriculture, understanding the consequences of introducing foreign microbes into soil taxonomic and functional diversity is necessary. This study evaluated the effects co-inoculation of soybean with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) RZ2MS9 and commercial rhizobia on the natural microbial community structure and functional potential. Our results indicated that soybean development was positively influenced by co-inoculation, plants exhibited greater height and a higher number of pods, and no reductions in productivity estimates. Soil prokaryotic diversity and community structure remained unchanged by Bt RZMS9 inoculation or co-inoculation with rhizobia 147 days after sowing. However, functional diversity was influenced by sole Bt inoculation, potentially due to community quorum sensing disruption by N-acyl homoserine lactone hydrolases. The genes enriched by co-inoculation were mostly related to soil phosphorus cycling, with gcd showing the most pronounced increase. The nifA genes increased when rhizobia alone were inoculated, suggesting that this pathway could be affected by Bt RZ2MS9 inoculation. This study demonstrates the synergistic activity of rhizobia and Bt RZ2MS9 on soybean development, without significantly interfering with natural microbial community, presenting a promising approach for sustainable crop management.
   We demonstrated that co-inoculating Bacillus thuringiensis RZ2MS9 with rhizobia in soybean does not affect soil taxonomic diversity over a production cycle but decreased soil functional diversity at the flowering stage.

TI  - A Mechanistic Model of Microbially Mediated Soil Biogeochemical Processes: A Reality Check
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
AB  - Present gaps in the representation of key soil biogeochemical processes such as the partitioning of soil organic carbon among functional components, microbial biomass and diversity, and the coupling of carbon and nutrient cycles present a challenge to improving the reliability of projected soil carbon dynamics. We introduce a new soil biogeochemistry module linked with a well-tested terrestrial biosphere model T&C. The module explicitly distinguishes functional soil organic carbon components. Extracellular enzymes and microbial pools are differentiated based on the functional roles of bacteria, saprotrophic, and mycorrhizal fungi. Soil macrofauna is also represented. The model resolves the cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Model simulations for 20 sites compared favorably with global patterns of litter and soil stoichiometry, microbial and macrofaunal biomass relations with soil organic carbon, soil respiration, and nutrient mineralization rates. Long-term responses to bare fallow and nitrogen addition experiments were also in agreement with observations. Some discrepancies between predictions and observations are appreciable in the response to litter manipulation. Upon successful model reproduction of observed general trends, we assessed patterns associated with the carbon cycle that were challenging to address empirically. Despite large site-to-site variability, fine root, fungal, bacteria, and macrofaunal respiration account for 33%, 40%, 24%, and 3% on average of total belowground respiration, respectively. Simulated root exudation and carbon export to mycorrhizal fungi represent on average about 13% of plant net primary productivity. These results offer mechanistic and general estimates of microbial biomass and its contribution to respiration fluxes and to soil organic matter dynamics.

TI  - Community assemblage of free-living diazotrophs along the elevational gradient of Mount Gongga
T2  - SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Mountain systems are unique for studying the responses of species distribution and diversity to environmental changes along elevational gradients. It is well known that free-living diazotrophic microorganisms are important to nitrogen cycling in mountain systems. However, the elevational patterns of free-living diazotrophs and the underlying ecological processes in controlling their turnover along broader gradients are less well documented. Here, we investigated the pattern of diazotrophic diversity along the elevational gradient (1800 m-4100 m) in Mount Gongga of China. The results showed that the alpha -diversity of diazotrophs did not change with the elevation from 1800 m to 2800 m, but decreased at elevations above 3000 m. Such diversity pattern was driven mainly by soil total carbon, nitrogen, and plant richness. Various diazotrophic taxa showed differential abundance-elevation relationships. Ecological processes determining diazotrophic community assemblage shift along the elevations. Deterministic processes were relatively stronger at both low and high elevations, whereas stochastic processes were stronger at the middle elevation. This study also suggested a strong relationship among aboveground plants and diazotrophs, highlighting their potential interactions, even for free-living diazotrophs.

TI  - An agricultural practise with climate and food security benefits: "Claying" with kaolinitic clay subsoil decreased soil carbon priming and mineralisation in sandy cropping soils
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - As the agricultural sector seeks to feed a growing global population, climate-smart agriculture offers opportunities to concurrently mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and/or increasing carbon storage in soils. This study examined the potential for clay addition to reduce CO2 emissions from plant residues and soil organic matter in a sandy soil. Soils were sourced from a 15-year-old field trial where claying (200 t ha(-1)) had already demonstrated improvements in water infiltration, grain yield and profits. Isotopically labelled plant residues (wheat, canola, or pea) were used to separate residue-derived and soil-derived CO2 sources from a nil-clay control, a historically clayed, and two freshly created soils with either high (10%) or low (3%) subsoil clay additions. Laboratory incubations demonstrated that historically clayed soils released less CO2 from plant residues and soil organic matter. Clay addition also decreased the priming effect of adding fresh residue to soils. The results from clay experimentally added in the laboratory varied. Differences in chemical and biological indicators (pH, microbial biomass C and N, extractable organic C and N, NO3-, NH4+, abundance of bacterial, archaeal, fungal, LMCO, GH48 and CbhI genes) did not correlate with patterns of CO2 emissions across treatments. While claying practices have previously demonstrated benefits to crop productivity, this research demonstrates long-term changes in carbon-cycling that could promote greater carbon sequestration.

TI  - Water-Insoluble Components in Rainwater in Suburban Guiyang, Southwestern China: A Potential Contributor to Dissolved Organic Carbon
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in rainwater affects climate change and global carbon cycles. Relatively little work has focused on DOC and the remaining water-insoluble components (WICs) simultaneously; moreover, the potential transformation of WICs to DOC remains questionable. The WICs (i.e., nonleachable particulates) were extracted from rainwater collected in suburban Guiyang (southwestern China) over a 1-year period. Correlations of DOC with indicative parameters (e.g., potassium, calcium, and sulfate ions) showed that DOC (271 +/- 152 mu mol L-1) was partly derived from biomass burning, soils, and nitrate- and sulfate-related secondary processes. Moreover, DOC concentration tended to increase with decreasing particulate amino acid-based degradation index, likely suggesting that the biodegradation of WICs can enhance DOC abundance. Further, a laboratory simulation with WICs from rainwater and particulate matter (PM2.5) demonstrated the microbe-driven rapid increase in DOC. The organic matter in rainwater was compositionally similar to that in concurrently collected PM2.5, suggesting that rainwater DOC in this area was largely controlled by in-cloud scavenging of fine particles. This consideration was confirmed by insignificant differences in volume-weighted DOC concentrations between forepart and posterior (cloud water with little below-cloud scavenging effect) rainwater. Since the time for rainwater to reach the ground is fairly short, the overall results can indicate that the in-cloud processing of WICs is a potential source of rainwater DOC. Moreover, this source contribution was estimated to be less than 2% per day. Therefore, the study provides novel insights into the carbon cycle in the atmosphere and surface ecosystems.

TI  - Enhanced plant litter impacts nematode communities and carbon use efficiency in a mixed forest
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Rising temperatures and higher atmospheric CO2 levels can potentially increase plant photosynthesis and boost forest productivity, thereby spurring litter inputs to soils on a global scale. Understanding the feedback loops between increased litter inputs and soil biota activity will allow for better prediction of organic matter and carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. Nematodes represent the full spectrum of trophic groups within the soil biota. Accordingly, we studied the link between nematode metabolic activities and plant litter input. For this, different litter input levels were manipulated in a temperate forest, including control zones without litter, natural litter input zones and zones with double, triple and quadruple amounts of natural litter input. Soil top layers (0-10 cm) were then collected to study the responses of nematode communities. Increased litter input positively influenced the abundance and diversity of nematodes, except for plant-parasitic species. Higher litter input levels led to an enhancement in the ratio of bacterivores to the total of bacterivores and fungivores. More litter increased the K/r strategist ratio among bacterivores and the corresponding nematode metabolic footprints. More litter also stimulated nematode production and respiration components and improved the carbon use efficiency of bacterivores. Moreover, structural equation modelling revealed the crucial role of bacterivores in influencing soil organic C under increased litter input. In conclusion, our study shows that increased plant above-ground litter input modifies the taxonomic and functional communities of soil nematodes, ultimately regulating carbon cycling in forest soils.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

TI  - Cascade damming impacts on microbial mediated nitrogen cycling in rivers
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Rivers display essential role in nitrogen (N) cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but now they are suffering from damming worldwide, especially from cascade damming. Despite of the importance of microorganisms in biogeochemical nutrient cycling, little attention has been paid to microbial functional biogeography under damming disturbances. Here, the Geochip microarray was applied to investigate the microbial mediated N cycling across the single-dammed Yarlung Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River and the cascade-dammed LancangMekong River in southwest China. Our results showed that the N cycling processes (nitrogen fixation, ammonification, denitrification, nitrification and anammox) were stimulated in reservoirs in both rivers and the enhancement was inversely coupled with hydraulic retention time, but the recovery of N-cycling gene abundance in downstream of dam was intervened by cascade damming. Moreover, N-cycling gene composition was significantly altered in the single-dammed river, while no remarkable change was found in the cascade-dammed reaches. However, different from the unvaried gene composition, cascade damming intervened the recovery of N cycling gene flow connectivity and resulted in the continuous decrease of connectivity in cascade damming reaches. In addition, in the single-dammed river, nutrients were the important drivers for variation in gene abundance, while they did not influence gene composition. Meanwhile, the abundance and composition of N cycling genes in the cascade-dammed river were both significantly correlated to geographical parameters and water physical characteristics. Therefore, our study has vital implications for anticipating microbial functional response and biogeochemical feedback to ongoing cascade damming, contributing to the protection of river ecosystems under river regulation.

TI  - Modeling carbon cycles and estimation of greenhouse gas emissions from organic and conventional farming systems
T2  - RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS
CP  - 1st Scientific Conference of the International-Society-of-Organic-Agriculture Research
AB  - The paper describes the model software REPRO (REPROduction of soil fertility) designed for analyzing interlinked carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) fluxes in the system soil-plant-animal-environment. The model couples the balancing of C, N and energy fluxes with the target to estimate the climate-relevant CO2, CH4 and N2O sources and sinks of fanning systems. For the determination of the net greenhouse effect, calculations of C sequestration in the Soil, CO2 emissions from the use of fossil energy, CH4 emissions from livestock keeping and N2O emissions from the soil have been made. The results were converted into CO2 equivalents using its specific global warming potential (GWP). The model has been applied in the experimental farm Scheyem in southern Germany, which had been divided into an organic (org) and a conventional (con) farming system in 1992. Rather detailed series of long-term measuring data are available for the farm in Scheyern, which have been used for validating the software for its efficiency and applicability under very different management yet nearly equal site conditions.
   The organic farm is multi-structured with a legume-based crop rotation (N-2 fixation: 83 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). The livestock density (LSU =Livestock Unit according to FAO) is 1.4 LSU ha(-1). The farm is oriented on closed mass cycles; from the energetic point of view it represents a low-input system (energy input 4.5 GJ ha(-1) yr(-1)). The conventional farm is a simple-structured cash crop system, based on mineral N (N input 145 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Regarding the energy consumption, the system is run on high inputs (energy input 14.0 GJ ha(-1) yr(-1)). The organic crop rotation reaches about 57% (8.3 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) of the DM yield, about 66% (163 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) of the N removal and roughly 56% (3741 kg ha(-1) yr(-1))of the C fixation of the conventional crop rotation. In the organic rotation, 18 GJ per GJ of fossil energy input are bound in the harvested biomass vis-a-vis 11.1 GJ in the conventional rotation. The strongest influence on the greenhouse effect is exerted by C sequestration and N2O emissions. In Scheyern, C sequestration has set in under organic management (+0.37 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), while humus depletion has been recorded in the conventional system (-0.25 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)).
   Greenhouse gas emissions (GGEs) due to fuel consumption and the use of machines are nearly on the same level in both crop rotations. However, the conventional system emits an additional 637 kg CO2 eq ha(-1) yr(-1), which had been consumed in the manufacture of mineral N and pesticides in the upstream industry.
   Besides the analyses in the experimental farm Scheyern, the model has been applied in 28 commercial farms (18 org and 10 con) with comparable soil and climate conditions in the surroundings of Scheyern (mean distance 60 km). The program calculations are aimed at benchmarking the results obtained in the farming systems Scheyern; they are expected to disclose management-specific variations in the emission of climate-relevant gases and to rate the suitability of the model for describing such management-specific effects. In order to make the situation in the farms comparable, only the emissions from cropping systems were analyzed. Livestock keeping remained unconsidered. Due to lower N and energy inputs, clearly lower N2O and CO2 emissions were obtained for the organic farms than for the conventional systems.
   The analyses have shown possibilities for the optimization of management and the mitigation of GGE. Our findings underline that organic farming includes a high potential for C sequestration and the reduction of GGEs. Currently, the model REPRO is tested by 90 farms in the Federal Republic of Germany with the aim to apply it in the future not only in the field of research but also in the management of commercial farms.

TI  - Mechanisms underlying the succession of plant rhizosphere microbial community structure and function in an alpine open-pit coal mining disturbance zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Elucidating the responses and potential functions of soil microbial communities during succession is important for understanding biogeochemical processes and the sustainable development of plant communities after environmental disturbances. However, studies of such dynamics during post-mining ecological restoration in alpine areas remain poorly understood. Microbial diversity, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycle functional gene potential in the Heishan mining area of Northwest China was studied, including primitive succession, secondary succession, and artificial succession disturbed by mining. The results revealed that: (1) The dominant bacteria in both categories (non-remediated and ecologically restored) of mining area rhizosphere soil were Proteobacteria, adopting the r strategy, whereas in naturally occurring soil outside the mining area, the dominant bacteria were actinomycetes and Acidobacteria, adopting the k strategy. Notably, mining perturbation significantly reduced the relative abundance of archaea. (2) After restoration, more bacterial network node connections were observed in mining areas than were originally present, whereas the archaeal network showed the opposite trend. (3) The networks of microbial genes related to nitrogen and phosphorus cycle potential differed significantly, depending on the succession type. Namely, prior to restoration, there were more phosphorus related functional gene network connections; these were also more strongly correlated, and the network was more aggregated. (4) Soil factors such as pH and NO3-N affected both the mining area remediation soil and the soil outside the mining area, but did not affect the soil of the original vegetation in the mining area. The changes in the structure and function of plant rhizosphere microorganisms after mining disturbance can provide a theoretical basis for the natural restoration of mining areas.

TI  - Warming enhances soil microbial respiration through divergent mechanisms in a tropical forest and a temperate forest
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resulting from soil microbial respiration constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle. However, the impact of climate warming on these emissions remains inconclusive, as it is uncertain whether microorganisms increase CO2 emissions from soils to the atmosphere by increasing their respiration or mitigate them through thermal adaptation. Here, we conducted both in-situ warming experiments and laboratory-controlled assays to investigate whether microbial respiration exhibits thermal adaptation in a temperate forest soil and a tropical forest soil. We also examined the mechanisms of microbial thermal adaptation by analyzing changes in microbial respiratory temperature sensitivity (Q10) and community structure (via amplicon sequencing). Our findings indicate that no thermal adaptation occurs and that in-situ warming enhances microbial respiration in both temperate and tropical forest soil samples, regardless of glucose addition. In the temperate forest soil, warming increased microbial respiration without significantly affecting respiratory Q10 and diversity. Conversely, in the tropical forest soil, warming increased microbial respiration by significantly increasing respiratory Q10 (by 8.13% with excess glucose and by 10.93% without excess glucose) and shifting diversity, including decreased richness and reduced Shannon diversity. The divergent responses of tropical and temperate forest soil microbes to warming may be attributed to temperature differences, leading to distinct microbial strategies for coping with temperature changes. Although limited to two sites and requiring further validation, our findings carrying significant implications for gaining insights into how soil microorganisms globally react to climate warming and for making future predictions about the intricate feedback mechanisms between the carbon cycle and climate.

TI  - The Impacts of Riparian Vegetation Buffer Strips on Soil Nitrogen Components and Microbial Communities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Riparian vegetation buffer strips play a crucial role in soil and water conservation, yet the impact of different vegetation on soil nitrogen components and microbial communities remains poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different riparian vegetation buffer strip on soil organic nitrogen components and microbial communities. Three types of riparian vegetation buffer strips along Taihu Lake in Yixing City (mixed poplar (Populus x euramericana "Nanlin 95") and Taxodium "zhongshanshan" (Taxodium"zhongshanshan"), pure poplar, and pure Taxodium "zhongshanshan") were compared with barren land (HD) as control. Soil nitrogen components, microbial community characteristics, abundance, and their relationships were analyzed across 0-60 cm soil profiles. Results showed that all riparian vegetation buffer strips significantly increased soil total nitrogen (TN) content compared to HD, with content decreasing with soil depth. Riparian vegetation buffer strips significantly enhanced microbial abundance and diversity, with mixed buffer strips exhibiting the highest abundance of Chloroflexi and Acidobacteriota, which contribute positively to nitrogen cycling. RDA revealed that soil nitrogen components and enzyme activities were positively correlated with soil organic carbon (SOC) content but negatively with total potassium (TK) content. The microbial communities in mixed riparian vegetation buffer strips and pure Taxodium "zhongshanshan" buffer strips were closely associated with organic nitrogen parameters (P < 0.05), while communities in pure poplar buffer strips and HD were more related to TK. These findings demonstrate that strategically designed mixed riparian vegetation buffer strips offer superior enhancement of soil nitrogen cycling and microbial diversity compared to pure vegetation buffer strips, these findings provide valuable insights for optimizing riparian vegetation buffer strips design to improve soil quality and nitrogen management in lakeside ecosystems.

TI  - Comparison With Global Soil Radiocarbon Observations Indicates Needed Carbon Cycle Improvements in the E3SM Land Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - We evaluated global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and turnover time predictions from a global land model (ELMv1-ECA) integrated in an Earth System Model (E3SM) by comparing them with observed soil bulk and Delta C-14 values around the world. We analyzed observed and simulated SOC stocks and Delta C-14 values using machine learning methods at the Earth System Model grid cell scale (similar to 200km). In grid cells with sufficient observations, the model provided reasonable estimates of soil carbon stocks across soil depth and Delta C-14 values near the surface but underestimated Delta C-14 at depth. Among many explanatory variables, soil albedo index, soil order, plant function type, air temperature, and SOC content were major factors affecting predicted SOC Delta C-14 values. The influences of soil albedo index, soil order, and air temperature were primarily important in the shallow subsurface (<= 30cm). We also performed sensitivity studies using different vertical root distributions and decomposition turnover times and compared to observed SOC stock and Delta C-14 profiles. The analyses support the role of vegetation in affecting soil carbon turnover, particularly in deep soil, possibly through supplying fresh carbon and degrading physical-chemical protection of SOC via root activities. Allowing for grid cell-specific rooting and decomposition rates substantially reduced discrepancies between observed and predicted Delta C-14 values and SOC content. Our results highlight the need for more explicit representation of roots, microbes, and soil physical protection in land models.
   Plain Language Summary Quantifying feedbacks between the terrestrial carbon cycle and climate is important for understanding climate change. Among many factors that control terrestrial carbon cycle responses to climate, soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are particularly important, although highly uncertain. In addition to SOC stocks, radiocarbon is an important observational constraint for land model predictions. We evaluated, against worldwide observations of SOC stocks and radiocarbon, predictions from a new land model used for climate change analyses. We analyzed differences between model predictions and observations using a machine learning method at a large grid cell scale (similar to 200km). Among many explanatory variables, soil albedo index, soil order, plant function type, air temperature, and SOC densities were major factors affecting predicted SOC radiocarbon values. The influences of soil albedo index, soil order, and air temperature were primarily important for topsoil. Our sensitivity analysis highlights the role of plant root activity in affecting soil carbon turnover, particularly in deep soil, possibly through supplying fresh carbon and degrading physical-chemical protection of SOC. Allowing for grid cell-specific rooting and decomposition rates substantially reduced discrepancies between observed and predicted values. Our results highlight the need for more explicit representation of roots, microbes, and soil physical protection in land models.

TI  - Regulatory Mechanisms of Tannins on the Decomposition Rate of Mixed Leaf Litter in Submerged Environments
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Terrestrial cross-boundary inputs of leaf litter serve as a critical foundation for secondary productivity in freshwater ecosystems. The regulatory mechanisms of tannins in leaf litter on degradation rates under submerged conditions remain unclear. This study employed leaf litter from low-tannin plants Osmanthus fragrans (A) and Canna glauca (B) as decomposition substrates, with the high-tannin species Myriophyllum verticillatum (C) incorporated to adjust tannin levels. A 140-day hydroponic degradation experiment was conducted under controlled temperature and dark conditions, which included four mixed litter treatments with a gradient of tannin additions (AB as the control, 0 g; ABC1: 0.5 g; ABC2: 2.5 g; ABC3: 4.5 g) along with two single-species treatments (A and B). The following results were found: (1) Low tannin levels (ABC1) promoted degradation rates of A and B (increased by 1.33-12.70%), whereas high tannin (ABC3) inhibited decomposition (decreased by 6.21-6.82%). (2) Tannin-protein complexes reduce nitrogen bioavailability and inhibit nitrification, thereby disrupting the nitrogen cycle in aquatic systems. In ABC3, total nitrogen content in A and B litter increased by 17.69-26.46% compared to AB, with concurrent 59.29% elevation in water NH4+-N concentration. (3) High tannin induced dominance of oligotrophic stress-resistant bacterial communities (e.g., Treponema) through nutrient limitation and toxicity stress; however, their low metabolic efficiency reduced overall decomposition efficiency. Research reveals that the ecological benefits of plant secondary metabolites outweigh their nutritional quality attributes.

TI  - Effect of harvest gap formation and thinning on soil nitrogen cycling at the boreal-temperate interface
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - In mixedwood forest, different types of commercial thinning that generate different gap sizes are being tested as alternatives to clearcutting to create forest stands with an irregular structure that would emulate the pre-industrial forests. The main goal of this study was to investigate the soil nitrogen (N) dynamics in response to two partial harvesting treatments, used alone or in combination: commercial thinning creating tree-size canopy gaps and harvest gaps creating 0.05 ha gaps. In a 30 year old balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) stand, both treatments, alone or in combination, as well as unharvested controls were compared on replicated 0.75 ha plots. The most noticeable changes following treatments were observed in gaps, while commercial thinning did not significantly influence any of the parameters assessed. In gaps, increases in N mineralization rates and mineral N concentrations and proportions (NO3--N and NH4+-N) relative to dissolved organic N were observed. Our results suggest that these changes are caused by the increase in soil temperature and water content. In these forests, the response threshold of the N cycling regarding the size of the intervention would therefore be located between the removal of one or a few trees (one to three stems, 6-12m(2)) and a gap of 500m(2). Other studies conducted in different climate and forest types have shown that this threshold could be of equivalent or of a smaller size. These findings will contribute to optimizing our management strategies regarding partial cuts or small-scale clearcuts.

TI  - Prairie restoration and carbon sequestration: difficulties quantifying C sources and sinks using a biometric approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - We investigated carbon cycling and ecosystem characteristics among two prairie restoration treatments established in 1987 and adjacent cropland, all part of the Conservation Reserve Program in southwestern Wisconsin, USA. We hypothesized that different plant functional groups (cool-season C-3 vs. warm-season C-4 grasses) between the two prairie restoration treatments would lead to differences in soil and vegetation characteristics and amount of sequestered carbon, compared to the crop system.
   We found significant (P < 0.05) differences between the two prairie restoration treatments in soil CO2 respiration and above- and belowground productivity, but no significant differences in long-term (similar to 16-year) carbon sequestration. We used a biometric approach aggregating short-term observations of above- and belowground productivity and CO2 respiration to estimate total net primary production (NPP) and net ecosystem production (NEP) using varied methods suggested in the literature. Net ecosystem production is important because it represents the ecosystem carbon sequestration, which is of interest to land managers and policymakers seeking or regulating credits for ecosystem carbon storage. Such a biometric approach would be attractive because it might offer the ability to rapidly assess the carbon source/sink status of an ecosystem.
   We concluded that large uncertainties in (1) estimating aboveground NPP, (2) determining belowground NPP, and (3) partitioning soil respiration into microbial and plant components strongly affect the magnitude, and even the sign, of NEP estimates made from aggregating its components. A comparison of these estimates across treatments could not distinguish differences in NEP, nor the absolute sign of the overall carbon balance. Longer-term quanti. cation of carbon stocks in the soil, periodically linked to measurements of individual processes, may offer a more reliable measure of the carbon balance in grassland systems, suitable for assigning credits.

TI  - A tipping point in carbon storage when forest expands into tundra is related to mycorrhizal recycling of nitrogen
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Tundra ecosystems are global belowground sinks for atmospheric CO2. Ongoing warming-induced encroachment by shrubs and trees risks turning this sink into a CO2 source, resulting in a positive feedback on climate warming. To advance mechanistic understanding of how shifts in mycorrhizal types affect long-term carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks, we studied small-scale soil depth profiles of fungal communities and C-N dynamics across a subarctic-alpine forest-heath vegetation gradient. Belowground organic stocks decreased abruptly at the transition from heath to forest, linked to the presence of certain tree-associated ectomycorrhizal fungi that contribute to decomposition when mining N from organic matter. In contrast, ericoid mycorrhizal plants and fungi were associated with organic matter accumulation and slow decomposition. If climatic controls on arctic-alpine forest lines are relaxed, increased decomposition will likely outbalance increased plant productivity, decreasing the overall C sink capacity of displaced tundra.

TI  - Fungal interactions reduce carbon use efficiency
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - The efficiency by which fungi decompose organic matter contributes to the amount of carbon that is retained in biomass vs. lost to the atmosphere as respiration. This carbon use efficiency (CUE) is affected by various abiotic conditions, including temperature and nutrient availability. Theoretically, the physiological costs of interspecific interactions should likewise alter CUE, yet the magnitude of these costs is untested. Here we conduct a microcosm experiment to quantify how interactions among wood-decay basidiomycete fungi alter growth, respiration and CUE across a temperature and nitrogen gradient. We show that species interactions induced consistent declines in CUE, regardless of abiotic conditions. Multispecies communities exhibited reductions in CUE of up to 25% relative to individual CUE, with this biotic effect being greater than the observed variation attributable to abiotic conditions. Our results suggest that the extent to which fungal-mediated carbon fluxes respond to environmental change may be influenced strongly by species interactions.

TI  - Combining waste biomass with functional microorganisms can effectively ameliorate hardened saline-alkali soil and promote plant growth
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsSoil salinization, a prevalent ecological issue in China and even worldwide, has resulted in soil compaction, which has emerged as a crucial barrier to agricultural economic development in northwest China.MethodsIn this study, a soil amendment (D2) was created using microorganisms capable of dissolving phosphorus, fixing nitrogen, and releasing potassium, as well as waste biomass carriers such as corn cobs, pine needles, bone meal and seashell powder, with the aim of revitalizing hardened saline-alkali soil and improving its overall quality.ResultsThe potted plant experiment verified that D2 application over 60 days notably boosted soil enzyme activity, organic matter, porosity, and water retention, while reducing soil pH and bulk density, signifying a healthier soil environment. Concurrently, it significantly promoted plant growth, increased rhizosphere microbial diversity and abundance of genes related to soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling, underscoring D2's potential as a sustainable soil conditioner that significantly enhances soil environment quality.ConclusionD2 has demonstrated excellent ability to remediate hardened saline-alkali soil, making it an environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to traditional chemical amendments.

TI  - A global meta-analysis reveals the positive effect of invasive alien plants on soil heterotrophic respiration
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Plant invasions represent a major global change in the carbon cycle. Soil respiration (Rs) comprises autotrophic respiration (Ra) and heterotrophic respiration (Rh). Understanding the impacts of plant invasions on different components of soil respiration is critical for predicting how invasive alien plants (IAPs) affect the exchange of C between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. However, the responses of Rs, Rh and Ra to IAPs are poorly understood on a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis based on 54 published papers and 256 observations to explore the effects of IAPs on Rs, Rh and Ra. Overall, the results showed that at the global scale, IAPs significantly increased the Rh by an average of 87.91% but had no significant effects on Rs or Ra. Regarding the life forms, we found that invasive forbs significantly increased Rh regardless of ecosystem type, and the subgroup analysis of ecosystem types showed that invasive forbs significantly increased Rh only in grasslands. However, the effects of IAPs on soil Rs and Rh did not differ among ecosystem types. Soil respiration is substantially influenced by soil biotic and abiotic properties. We found IAPs significantly increased microbial biomass carbon (MBC) by 9.28% (mainly from invasive forbs) and soil beta-glucosidase activity by 80.35% (mainly from invasive shrubs), but the IAPs had no significant effect on invertase activity. The effect size of Rh was significantly positively correlated with the changes in soil pH, MBC and beta-glucosidase. In addition, the response of Rh differed depending on the ecosystem management approach. IAPs significantly increased the Rh in abandoned ecosystems but had no significant effects on the Rh in managed ecosystems or natural ecosystems. These results emphasize the importance and complexity of the relationship between IAPs and soil respiration and highlight the need for better management to reduce soil respiration due to plant invasion.

TI  - Plant species diversity and abundance of functional groups influence net nitrogen mineralization along productivity gradients in montane Calluna-dominated heathlands
T2  - PLANTS PEOPLE PLANET
AB  - Societal Impact StatementHeathlands are globally important ecosystems that provide key functions and services but are increasingly threatened by land use changes. We investigated how plant diversity and productivity influence nitrogen cycling under different management regimes. Our findings reveal that extensive grazing modulates the relationship between plant diversity and soil nitrogen dynamics, with contrasting effects in grazed versus abandoned sites. Increased plant species diversity and abundance of annual and perennial herbs in grazed sites were associated with enhanced N mineralization rates. These insights highlight the need for adaptive management strategies to address the challenges posed by land use changes and biodiversity loss in heathland ecosystems.Summary Abiotic controls on soil N-transformations in heathlands are well understood; however, the effects of plant species diversity-productivity on N cycling remain unclear, particularly concerning grazing management. We evaluated the feedbacks among plant species diversity, functional group productivity and soil properties, as well as their relationship with net N mineralization rates, in six heathlands dominated by Calluna vulgaris with differing management history (grazed at low intensity and abandoned). Our findings revealed a pronounced increase in soil organic matter content with plant diversity in abandoned, species-poor heathlands compared to the stronger feedback with soil total N in grazed, species-rich sites, suggesting trade-offs in the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. Mean net ammonification, nitrification, and mineralization rates showed no significant differences between species-rich and species-poor heathlands. However, increased plant species diversity and abundance of productive functional groups in grazed sites were associated with enhanced N mineralization rates. In contrast, high species diversity in abandoned heathlands led to increased woody species productivity with traits related to nutrient conservation, which was linked to slower N mineralization rates. These findings enhance our understanding of the effects of the diversity-productivity relationship on nitrogen cycling in heathlands, providing insights for anticipating ecosystem responses to changing management regimes.

TI  - Elevated Atmospheric CO2 Impacts Abundance and Diversity of Nitrogen Cycling Functional Genes in Soil
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere has increased over the last century. Although this increase is unlikely to have direct effects on soil microbial communities, increased atmospheric CO2 may impact soil ecosystems indirectly through plant responses. This study tested the hypothesis that exposure of plants to elevated CO2 would impact soil microorganisms responsible for key nitrogen cycling processes, specifically denitrification and nitrification. We grew trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) trees in outdoor chambers under ambient (360 ppm) or elevated (720 ppm) levels of CO2 for 5 years and analyzed the microbial communities in the soils below the trees using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and clone library sequencing targeting the nitrite reductase (nirK) and ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes. We observed a more than twofold increase in copy numbers of nirK and a decrease in nirK diversity with CO2 enrichment, with an increased predominance of Bradyrhizobia-like nirK sequences. We suggest that this dramatic increase in nirK-containing bacteria may have contributed to the significant loss of soil N in the CO2-treated chambers. Elevated CO2 also resulted in a significant decrease in copy numbers of bacterial amoA, but no change in archaeal amoA copy numbers. The decrease in abundance of bacterial amoA was likely a result of the loss of soil N in the CO2-treated chambers, while the lack of response for archaeal amoA supports the hypothesis that physiological differences in these two groups of ammonia oxidizers may enable them to occupy distinct ecological niches and respond differently to environmental change.

TI  - Irrigation and enhanced soil carbon input effects on below-ground carbon cycling in semiarid temperate grasslands
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Global climate change is generally expected to increase net primary production, resulting in increased soil carbon (C) inputs. To gain an understanding of how such increased soil C inputs would affect C cycling in the vast grasslands of northern China, we conducted a field experiment in which the responses of plant and microbial biomass and respiration were studied.
   Our experiment included the below-ground addition of particulate organic matter (POM) at rates equivalent to 0, 60, 120 and 240 g C m(-2), under either natural precipitation or under enhanced precipitation during the summer period (as predicted for that region in recent simulations using general circulation models).
   We observed that addition of POM had a large effect on soil microbial biomass and activity and that a major part of the added C was rapidly lost from the system. This suggests that microbial activity in the vast temperate grassland ecosystems of northern China is energy-limited. Moreover, POM addition (and the associated nutrient release) affected plant growth much more than the additional water input.
   Although we performed no direct fertilization experiments, the response of plant productivity to POM addition (and associated release of nutrients) leads us to believe that plant productivity in the semiarid grassland ecosystems of northern China is primarily limited by nutrients and not by water.

TI  - Ammonia-oxidizing Archaea in Kamchatka Hot Springs
T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Mounting evidence suggests that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) may play important roles in nitrogen cycling in geothermal environments. In this study, the diversity, distribution and ecological significance of AOA in terrestrial hot springs in Kamchatka (Far East Russia) were explored using amoA genes complemented by analysis of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) of archaea. PCR amplification of functional genes (amoA) from AOA and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was performed on microbial mats/streamers and sediments collected from three hot springs (42 degrees C to 87 degrees C and pH 5.5-7.0). No amoA genes of AOB were detected. The amoA genes of AOA formed three distinct phylogenetic clusters with Cluster 3 representing the majority (59%) of OTUs. Some of the sequences from Cluster 3 were closely related to those from acidic soil environments, which is consistent with the predominance of low pH (7.0) in these hot springs. Species richness (estimated by Chao1) was more frequently higher at temperatures below 75 degrees C than above it, indicating that AOA may be favored in the moderately high temperature environments. Quantitative PCR of 16S rRNA genes showed that crenarchaeota counted for up to 80% of total archaea. S-LIBSHUFF separated all samples into two phylogenetic groups. The profiles of GDGTs were well separated among the studied springs, suggesting a spatial patterning of archaeal lipid biomarkers. However, this patterning did not correlate significantly with variation in archaeal amoA, suggesting that AOA are not the predominant archaeal group in these springs producing the observed GDGTs.

TI  - Addition of activated switchgrass biochar to an aridic subsoil increases microbial nitrogen cycling gene abundances
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - It has been demonstrated that soil amended with biochar, designed specifically for use as a soil conditioner, results in changes to the microbial populations that reside therein. These changes have been reflected in studies measuring variations in microbial activity, biomass, and community structure. Despite these studies, very few experiments have been performed examining microbial genes involved in nutrient cycling processes. Given the paucity of research in this area, we designed a 6 month study in a Portneuf subsoil treated with three levels (1%, 2%, and 10% w/w ratio) of a biochar pyrolyzed from switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) at 350 degrees C and steam activated at 800 degrees C to measure the abundances of five genes involved in N cycling. Gene abundances were measured using qPCR, with relative abundances of these genes calculated based on measurement of the 16S rRNA gene. At the end of the 6 month study, all measured genes showed significantly greater abundances in biochar amended treatments as compared to the control. In soil amended with 10% biochar, genes involved in nitrogen fixation (nifH), and denitrification (nirS), showed significantly increased relative abundances. Lastly, gene abundances and-relative abundances correlated with soil characteristics, in particular NO3-N, % N and % C. These results confirm that activated switchgrass-derived biochar, designed for use as a soil conditioner, has an impact on the treated soils microbial communities. We therefore suggest that future use of biochar as a soil management practice should take into account not only changes to the soil's physiochemical properties, but its biological properties as well.

TI  - Impact of Tea Tree Cultivation on Soil Microbiota, Soil Organic Matter, and Nitrogen Cycling in Mountainous Plantations
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - This study focused on examining the early stages of tea cultivation (1, 3, and 5 years) in mountainous tea plantations. It specifically aimed to investigate the changes in soil micro-ecology at different locations (inter-row, terrace surfaces, and terrace walls). It was revealed that as tea tree cultivation progressed over the years, bacterial diversity and co-occurrence networks annually decreased in different locations. The results of soil physicochemical index analysis showed that the soil's available nutrients and the activities of cellulase and protease increased. Furthermore, the amplitude of variation of these indexes in the inter-row soil was significantly higher than that on the terrace surfaces and the terrace walls (p < 0.05). Alterations occurred in the soil microbial community structure, with an enrichment of bacterial genera such as Sinomonas, Granulicella, and Sphingomonas, as well as fungal genera such as Trichoderma, Penicillium, and Talaromyces; an increase in the proportion of plant pathogenic fungi (Cladosporium, Fusarium, and Curvularia) was observed in the inter-row soil. The results of soil microbial function prediction showed that nitrification and nitrogen fixation decreased, but denitrification increased (p < 0.05). In conclusion, cultivating tea trees in mountainous terraced plantations significantly impacted the soil microbial community, accelerated the metabolism of soil organic matter, disrupted soil nitrogen cycling functions, and increased the presence of plant pathogenic fungal pathogens. Moreover, the changes in the structure and functions of the soil microbial community demonstrate a spatial distance effect across different terrace locations.

TI  - Soil microbial responses to drought and exotic plants shift carbon metabolism
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Significant gaps in our understanding of how global change drivers interact to affect the resistance and functioning of microbial communities hinders our ability to model ecosystem responses and feedbacks to co-occurring global stressors. Here, we investigated the effects of extreme drought and exotic plants, two of the most significant threats to Mediterranean-type ecosystems, on soil microbial community composition and carbon metabolic genes within a four-year field rainfall manipulation experiment. We combined measurements of bulk microbial and soil properties with high-throughput microbial community analyses to elucidate microbial responses and microbial-mediated alterations to carbon cycling. While microbial responses to experimental droughts were weak, scant rainfall periods resulted in decreased microbial biomass and activity, and relative abundances of bacterial groups such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Acidobacteria decreased concomitantly with increases in Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes abundance. Soils under exotic plants had increased temperatures, enhanced infiltration during rainfall events, and decreased water retention and labile carbon in comparison to soils under native plants. Higher peaks and more seasonally variable microbial activity were found under exotic plants and, like drought periods, the microbial community shifted towards osmotic stress life-strategies. Relationships found between microbial taxonomic groups and carbon metabolic genes support the interpretation that exotic plants change microbial carbon cycling by altering the soil microclimate and supplying easily decomposed high-quality litter. Soil microbial community responses to drought and exotic plants could potentially impact ecosystem C storage by producing a smaller, more vulnerable C pool of microbial biomass that is prone to increased pulses of heterotrophic respiration.

TI  - Forest Thinning in Ponderosa Pines Increases Carbon Use Efficiency and Energy Flow From Primary Producers to Primary Consumers
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - A better understanding of carbon use efficiency (CUE) and carbon allocation during disturbance is critical to improve simulations of the global carbon cycle and understanding future climate impacts. Forest thinning of high-stem density, high elevation dry western US forests is becoming more common to reduce severe fire danger but there are uncertainties about how forest thinning may impact forest CUE, carbon allocation and energy flow through the food chain. In three, quarter ha stands with similar soils, elevation and climate along a forest thinning gradient near Flagstaff (AZ), we measured total net primary production (NPP of wood, fine root, and leaves), total autotrophic respiration (R-a of wood, rhizosphere, and canopy respiration), gross primary production (GPP = NPP + R-a) and large mammal herbivory (with camera traps and dung counts) over a similar to 2-year period. We found strong seasonality in all carbon cycling variables and herbivory, peaking during the warm, wet monsoon period. Carbon was produced more efficiently in the thinned stands, with carbon use efficiency (CUE = NPP/GPP) of similar to 0.63, versus the unthinned stand with CUE of 0.38. GPP was similar in the two thinned stands (similar to 3.5 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) but was about 30% greater in the unthinned stands (5.0 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)). Finally, the thinned stand had higher understory NPP, large herbivore consumption and had triple the total energy going into primary consumers. Overall, the thinning, and the return to a more natural prefire suppression forest structure, increased the CUE and energy flow from primary producers to primary consumers.

TI  - Impacts of chronic nitrogen additions vary seasonally and by microbial functional group in tundra soils
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Previous studies have shown that fertilization with nitrogen depresses overall microbial biomass and activity in soil. In the present study we broaden our understanding of this phenomenon by studying the seasonality of responses of specific microbial functional groups to chronic nitrogen additions in alpine tundra soils. We measured soil enzyme activities, mineralization kinetics for 8 substrates, biomass of 8 microbial functional groups, and changes in N and carbon pools in the soil. Our approach allowed us to compare the ability of the soil microbial biomass to utilize various substrates in addition to allowing us to estimate changes in biomass of microbial functional groups that are involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Overall microbial activity and biomass was reduced in fertilized plots, whereas pools of N in the soil and microbial biomass N were higher in fertilized plots. The negative effects of N were most prominent in the summer. Biomass of the dominant microbial functional groups recovered in fertilized soils during the winter and nitrogen storage in microbial biomass was higher in fertilized soils in the autumn and winter than in the summer. Microbial immobilization of N may therefore be a significant sink for added N during autumn and winter months when plants are not active. One large microbial group that did not recover in the winter in fertilized soils was phenol mineralizers, possibly indicating selection against microbes with enzyme systems for the breakdown of phenolic compounds and complex soil organic matter. Overall, this work is a step towards understanding how chronic N additions affect the structure and biogeochemical functioning of soil microbial communities.

TI  - Responses of ecosystem nitrogen cycle to nitrogen addition: a meta-analysis
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) addition may substantially alter the terrestrial N cycle. However, a comprehensive understanding of how the ecosystem N cycle responds to external N input remains elusive.
   Here, we evaluated the central tendencies of the responses of 15 variables associated with the ecosystem N cycle to N addition, using data extracted from 206 peer-reviewed papers.
   Our results showed that the largest changes in the ecosystem N cycle caused by N addition were increases in soil inorganic N leaching (461%), soil NO3- concentration (429%), nitrification (154%), nitrous oxide emission (134%), and denitrification (84%). N addition also substantially increased soil NH4+ concentration (47%), and the N content in belowground (53%) and aboveground (44%) plant pools, leaves (24%), litter (24%) and dissolved organic N (21%). Total N content in the organic horizon (6.1%) and mineral soil (6.2%) slightly increased in response to N addition. However, N addition induced a decrease in microbial biomass N by 5.8%.
   The increases in N effluxes caused by N addition were much greater than those in plant and soil pools except soil NO3-, suggesting a leaky terrestrial N system.

TI  - Nitrogen addition and warming rapidly alter microbial community compositions in the mangrove sediment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The mangrove ecosystem is an important CO2 sink with an extraordinarily high primary productivity. However, it is vulnerable to the impact of climate warming and eutrophication. While there has been extensive research on plant growth and greenhouse gas emission in mangrove ecosystems, microbial communities, the primary biogeochemical cycling drivers, are much less understood. Here, we examined whether short-term experimental treatments: (1) eutro-phication with a supplement of 185 g N m-2middotyear-1 (N), (2) 3? warming (W), and (3) the dual treatment of N and W (NW) were sufficient to alter microbial communities in the sediment. After 4 months of experiments, most environ-mental factors remained unchanged. However, N had significant, strong effects on bacterial, fungal, and functional community compositions, while the effects of W on microbial communities were weaker. N increased bacterial rich-ness, phylogenetic diversity, and evenness, owing to stronger stochastic processes induced by eutrophication. There were no interactive effects of N and W on bacterial, fungal, and functional community compositions, suggesting that joint effects of N and W were additive. Concomitant with higher N2O efflux induced by N, the relative abundances of most bacterial nitrogen cycling genes were increased or remained changed by N. In contrast, N decreased or did not change those of most bacterial carbon degradation genes, while W increased or did not change the relative abundances of most of bacterial and fungal carbon degradation genes, implying higher carbon degradation potentials. As the most abundant inorganic nitrogenous species in mangrove sediment, ammonium was a key factor in shaping microbial functional communities. Collectively, our findings showed that microbial community compositions in the mangrove sediment were highly sensitive to short-term N and W treatments, giving rise to ecological consequences such as higher N2O efflux.

TI  - The importance of integration and scale in the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
CP  - Workshop on Methods for Study of the Hyphae of AMH
AB  - The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus contributes to system processes and functions at various hierarchical organizational levels, through their establishment of linkages and feedbacks between whole-plants and nutrient cycles. Even though these fungal mediated feedbacks and linkages involve lower-organizational level processes (e.g. photo-assimilate partitioning, interfacial assimilate uptake and transport mechanisms, intraradical versus extraradical fungal growth), they influence higher-organizational scales that affect community and ecosystem behavior (e.g. whole-plant photosynthesis, biodiversity, nutrient and carbon cycling, soil structure). Hence, incorporating AM fungi into research directed at understanding many of the diverse environmental issues confronting society will require knowledge of how these fungi respond to or initiate changes in vegetation dynamics, soil fertility or both. Within the last few years, the rapid advancement in the development of analytical tools has increased the resolution by which we are able to quantify the mycorrhizal symbiosis. It is important that these tools are applied within a conceptual framework that is temporally and spatially relevant to fungus and host. Unfortunately, many of the studies being conducted on the mycorrhizal symbiosis at lower organizational scales are concerned with questions directed solely at understanding fungus or host without awareness of what the plant physiologist or ecologist needs for integrating the mycorrhizal association into larger organizational scales or process levels. We show by using the flow of C from plant-to-fungus-to-soil, that through thoughtful integration, we have the ability to bridge different organizational scales. Thus, an essential need of mycorrhizal research is not only to better integrate the various disciplines of mycorrhizal research, but also to identify those relevant links and scales needing further investigation for understanding the larger-organizational level responses.

TI  - Soil Carbon-Fixation Rates and Associated Bacterial Diversity and Abundance in Three Natural Ecosystems
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - CO2 assimilation by autotrophic microbes is an important process in soil carbon cycling, and our understanding of the community composition of autotrophs in natural soils and their role in carbon sequestration of these soils is still limited. Here, we investigated the autotrophic C incorporation in soils from three natural ecosystems, i.e., wetland (WL), grassland (GR), and forest (FO) based on the incorporation of labeled C into the microbial biomass. Microbial assimilation of C-14 (C-14-MBC) differed among the soils from three ecosystems, accounting for 14.2-20.2% of C-14-labeled soil organic carbon (C-14-SOC). We observed a positive correlation between the cbbL (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) large-subunit gene) abundance, C-14-SOC level, and C-14-MBC concentration confirming the role of autotrophic bacteria in soil carbon sequestration. Distinct cbbL-bearing bacterial communities were present in each soil type; form IA and form IC RubisCO-bearing bacteria were most abundant in WL, followed by GR soils, with sequences from FO soils exclusively derived from the form IC clade. Phylogenetically, the diversity of CO2-fixing autotrophs and CO oxidizers differed significantly with soil type, whereas cbbL-bearing bacterial communities were similar when assessed using coxL. We demonstrate that local edaphic factors such as pH and salinity affect the C-fixation rate as well as cbbL and coxL gene abundance and diversity. Such insights into the effect of soil type on the autotrophic bacterial capacity and subsequent carbon cycling of natural ecosystems will provide information to enhance the sustainable management of these important natural ecosystems.

TI  - Microbial growth and carbon use efficiency show seasonal responses in a multifactorial climate change experiment
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
AB  - Microbial growth and carbon use efficiency (CUE) are central to the global carbon cycle, as microbial remains form soil organic matter. We investigated how future global changes may affect soil microbial growth, respiration, and CUE. We aimed to elucidate the soil microbial response to multiple climate change drivers across the growing season and whether effects of multiple global change drivers on soil microbial physiology are additive or interactive. We measured soil microbial growth, CUE, and respiration at three time points in a field experiment combining three levels of temperature and atmospheric CO2, and a summer drought. Here we show that climate change-driven effects on soil microbial physiology are interactive and season-specific, while the coupled response of growth and respiration lead to stable microbial CUE (average CUE=0.39). These results suggest that future research should focus on microbial growth across different seasons to understand and predict effects of global changes on soil carbon dynamics. Eva Simon et al. show non-linear responses and non-additive interactive effects of climate change on microbial physiology, but not on microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE). These findings suggest that future research should focus on microbial growth instead of CUE alone to understand and predict effects of global changes on soil carbon dynamics.

TI  - No temperature acclimation of soil extracellular enzymes to experimental warming in an alpine grassland ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Alpine grassland soils store large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) and are susceptible to rising air temperature. Soil extracellular enzymes catalyze the rate-limiting step in SOC decomposition and their catalysis, production and degradation rates are regulated by temperature. Therefore, the responses of these enzymes to warming could have a profound impact on carbon cycling in the alpine grassland ecosystems. This study was conducted to measure the responses of soil extracellular enzyme activity and temperature sensitivity (Q(10)) to experimental warming in samples from an alpine grassland ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. A free air-temperature enhancement system was set up in May 2006. We measured soil microbial biomass, nutrient availability and the activity of five extracellular enzymes in 2009 and 2010. The Q(10) of each enzyme was calculated using a simple first-order exponential equation. We found that warming had no significant effects on soil microbial biomass C, the labile C or N content, or nutrient availability. Significant differences in the activity of most extracellular enzymes among sampling dates were found, with typically higher enzyme activity during the warm period of the year. The effects of warming on the activity of the five extracellular enzymes at 20 A degrees C were not significant. Enzyme activity in vitro strongly increased with temperature up to 27 A degrees C or over 30 A degrees C (optimum temperature; T-opt). Seasonal variations in the Q(10) were found, but the effects of warming on Q(10) were not significant. We conclude that soil extracellular enzymes adapted to seasonal temperature variations, but did not acclimate to the field experimental warming.

TI  - Coupled Biological and Abiotic Mechanisms Driving Carbonyl Sulfide Production in Soils
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
AB  - Understanding soil production of the trace gas carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is key to its use as a tracer of ecosystem function. Underlying its application is the observation that vascular plants consume atmospheric OCS via their stomatal pores in proportion with CO2 photosynthesis and that soil fluxes of OCS are negligible in comparison. Recent soil-centered studies demonstrate that soils can produce OCS and contribute as much as a quarter of the atmospheric terrestrial flux. Despite the potential widespread importance of soil OCS emissions, insufficient data exist to predict variations in OCS production across ecosystems, and the chemical and biological drivers of OCS production are virtually unknown. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by investigating variables controlling OCS soil production including soil physical and chemical properties, microbial community composition, and sulfur speciation in two independent surveys. We found that soil OCS production was nearly ubiquitous across the 58 sites, increased exponentially with temperature, and was insensitive to visible light conditioning. Soil pH, N, and C/N were predictors of OCS soil production rates in both soil surveys. Patterns in soil S speciation and predicted microbial S-cycling pathways both pointed to S-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine and their derivatives as potential precursors for OCS production. Elevated sulfate levels were associated with OCS production in some soils. This study provides new mechanistic insight into OCS production in soils and presents strategies to represent soil OCS fluxes that facilitate the use of OCS as a tracer for leaf-level processes related to carbon and water cycling.

TI  - Influence of distillery sewage sludge application placement methods on microbial community functions in sorghum rhizosphere: Focus on nitrogen and phosphorus cycling
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The effect of different fertilization methods using distillery sewage sludge (DSS) on the functional potential of soil microorganisms involved in nutrient cycling is largely unknown. This study used metagenomic sequencing to investigate the effects of two basic DSS application placement methods on soil microbial nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling in sorghum rhizosphere soil. The treatments applied were mix powder application (MF), spherical deep application (further classified as vertical (VF) and lateral (LF) placement methods), and no fertilization control (CK). The results showed that microbial diversity is highly correlated with soil AN and Ex-Na. The VF treatment revealed a high abundance of phnA, phnM, appA, and phnJ genes responsible for organic P mineralization. LF treatment significantly increased the abundance of hao and amoA/B/C genes involved in nitrification. MF treatment significantly enhanced the abundance of phnA, phoD, phnM, TC.PIT, and phoB genes, increasing the genetic potential for P cycling. Moreover, the abundance of N denitrification-related genes rose considerably during the MF treatment, increasing the risk of N loss. Network analysis showed that VF and LF treatments reduced the complexity and stability of soil microbial networks while modularity increased. The partial least squares path model demonstrated that N (including available N, ammonium N, and nitrate N), available P, and available potassium (K) directly influence N and P cycling. In contrast, changes in soil organic matter indirectly affect this cycling. This study offers comprehensive insights into the distinct microbial functional potentials associated with various DSS fertilization methods. The findings could potentially impact soil nutrient cycling in agroecosystems, particularly effective solid waste recycling from the distillery industry.

TI  - Grazing promotes soil phosphorus cycling by enhancing soil microbial functional genes for phosphorus transformation in plant rhizosphere in a semi-arid natural grassland
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Soil microorganisms play a key role in soil P transformation and cycling in grassland ecosystems, while the microbial mechanisms of animal grazing mediating soil P processes are not fully understood. We conducted a grazing experiment in a typical steppe grassland in Inner Mongolia, to explore the responses of microbial communities in rhizosphere and bulk soils to grazing intensity for understanding the mechanisms of grazing affecting P cycling. We determined soil physico-chemical properties and alkaline phosphatase activities, and measured soil microbial diversity and the relative abundance of microbial P-transformation genes by meta-genomics in the rhizosphere and bulk soils of a Stipa grandis dominated grassland under three grazing intensities (no-, moderate, and heavy grazing). We found that (i) grazing significantly increased soil available P concen-tration and soil alkaline phosphatase activity; (ii) grazing increased the abundance of bacterial, but not fungal communities, and the enhanced abundance of rhizosphere bacteria promotes the P-cycling potential; (iii) grazing increased the relative abundance of the genes responsible for microbial P-uptake and transport, and inorganic P solubilization and organic P mineralization in rhizosphere soil, but not in bulk soil; (iv) grazing reduced the node degree of the network of the genes involved in P-transformation, but it increased the node degree of the genes encoding alkaline phosphatase and the C-P lyase multi-enzyme complex in the rhizosphere soil. The grazing-induced changes in the abundance of microbial functional genes are beneficial to P-solubilization and miner-alization. Our results indicate a divergent effect of grazing on soil microbial communities and their functional genes involved P-transformation in rhizosphere and bulk soils, and represent an important progress towards the understanding of the mechanisms of microbial regulation of P cycling in grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of pyroxsulam on soil enzyme activity, nitrogen and carbon cycle-related gene expression, and bacterial community structure
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Pyroxsulam is a new herbicide which is being widely used to prevent the growth of broad-leaved weeds in wheat fields because of its low quantity of application and high efficiency. However, its ecotoxic effects on soil microorganisms have yet to be clarified. In the present study, the effects of pyroxsulam on soil enzymes, nitrogen and carbon cycle functional genes, and bacterial community structure in the soil were investigated. The effect of pyroxsulam on urease and dehydrogenase activities was not obvious at the end of the experiment (56 d), but beta-glucoside activity was consistently promoted. At the enzyme level, the effect of different concentrations of pyroxsulam on soil enzymes was within an acceptable range. Functional gene expression analysis indicated that the expression of the nitrogen-fixing gene (nifH), nitrifying gene (amoA), and carbon fixation gene (cbbL) was inhibited by three different doses of pyroxsulam, and the inhibition was most effective at 2.5 mg kg(-1). Therefore, the 2.5 mg kg(-1) pyroxsulam dose had adverse effects on functional genes, and application should be controlled. Combined with the results of soil bacterial community structure analysis, we concluded that pyroxsulam inhibited soil nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and carbon dioxide fixation and promoted soil denitrification. In addition, pyroxsulam increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria with the ability to inhibit the spread of soil diseases and degrade organic pollutants. According to the integrated biomarker response calculations, the green-like cbbL gene was the most sensitive indicator of pyroxsulam toxicity. A high concentration of pyroxsulam may have a negative impact on soil microorganisms in different aspects and dosage should therefore be carefully considered.

TI  - Multiple nutrients limit litterfall and decomposition in a tropical forest
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - To explore the importance of 12 elements in litter production and decomposition, we fertilized 36 1600 m(2)-plots with combinations of N, P, K, or micronutrients (i.e. B, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Mo, S, Zn) for 6 years in a lowland Panamanian forest. The 90% of litter falling as leaves and twigs failed to increase with fertilization, but reproductive litter (fruits and flowers) increased by 43% with N. K enhanced cellulose decomposition; one or more micronutrients enhanced leaf-litter decomposition; P enhanced both. Our results suggest tropical forests are a non-Liebig world of multiple nutrient limitations, with at least four elements shaping rates of litterfall and decomposition. Multiple metallomic enzymes and cofactors likely create gradients in the break down of leaf litter. Selection favours individuals that make more propagules, and even in an N-rich forest, N is a non-substitutable resource for reproduction.

TI  - Divergent modulation of land use-driven changes in soil properties and herbicide acetochlor application on soil nitrogen cycling
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - To boost grain yield, land use conversion and herbicide application are commonly considered two primary anthropogenic interventions to microbe-mediated nitrogen (N) cycling of soils. However, the coupling effects of land use and herbicide acetochlor application on soil N cycle are still poorly understood although separate role had been extensively investigated. A 31-day laboratory batch experiment on bacterial communities associated with N metabolism in soil collected from various land use types were carried out under acetochlor application using classic dilution plating method. The results showed soil characteristic changes induced by land-use strongly influenced soil bacterial communities, and pH, nitrate (NO3--N) contents were the best predictors for nitrifying bacteria (p < 0.05). Soil nitrifying bacteria was the dominant species in vegetable fields (VF30 and VF70), whereas denitrifying bacteria was the keystone species in paddy field cultivated over 100 years (PF100), resulting in mean nitrification potentials of vegetable fields approximately 3 times that of PF100 (p < 0.05). Rather, a dosage of 10 mg kg(-1) acetochlor application inhibited denitrification potentials in all three soils (p < 0.05), and had negligible impact on nitrification potentials. This could be attributed to decreases in abundance and activity of denitrifying bacteria after acetochlor application. Therefore, acetochlor application was capable of decreasing denitrification of N removal from soils to atmosphere, and vegetable cultivation enhanced transformation of ammonium (NH4+-N) to NO3--N species in comparison to paddy field. Our findings renew functional differentiations of land use and herbicide acetochlor application on soil N cycling, and give insight for soil N nutrient management in agricultural practices to ensure food security and improve environmental sustainablility.

TI  - Effects of Increasing CO2 Concentration on Crop Growth and Soil Ammonia-Oxidizing Microorganisms in a Fababean (Vicia faba L.) and Wheat (Triticum aestivum Yunmai) Intercropping System
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)) levels can enhance crop yields but may simultaneously reduce quality, impacting both macronutrient and micronutrient concentrations, and potentially decreasing protein content in cereal grains. This study examined the effects of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and nitrogen (N) fertilization on crop growth, yield, and soil nitrogen cycling through a glass greenhouse experiment using Eutric Regosol soil. The experimental design incorporated two CO2 gradients: ambient CO2 (aCO(2)) at approximately 410 ppm during the day and 460 ppm at night, and eCO(2) at approximately 550 ppm during the day and 610 ppm at night. Additionally, two nitrogen fertilization treatments were applied: no fertilizer (N0) and 100 mg N kg(-1) dry weight (DW) soil (N100). Crops were cultivated under two cropping systems: the monoculturing of fababean (Vicia faba L.) or wheat (Triticum aestivum Yunmai) and the intercropping of both species. The results demonstrated that eCO(2) significantly enhanced the growth and yield of both fababean and wheat, particularly when nitrogen fertilization was applied. Nitrogen fertilizer application did not always enhance crop yield, considering the complexity of nitrogen management under elevated CO2 conditions. Furthermore, the intercropping of fababean and wheat presented multiple advantages, including improved crop yields, enhanced soil health, and increased ecosystem services. These findings suggest that intercropping can serve as a sustainable strategy to boost productivity and ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change. The changes in nitrogen application and CO2 concentration affect the gene copy number of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea, which may affect the nitrogen cycling process in soil. There are complex interactions between crop biomass, nitrogen accumulation, transpiration rate, photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance with soil properties (e.g., pH, organic matter, nitrogen content) and microbial community structure. The interaction between CO2 concentration, nitrogen application level and crop intercropping pattern had significant effects on crop growth, soil properties and microbial communities. Future research should prioritize investigating the long-term effects of intercropping on soil productivity and the development of management strategies that optimize the benefits of this cropping system.

TI  - Responses of anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and methane-oxidizing archaea communities from different tillage modes in paddy fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - PurposeThe process of anaerobic ammonium (anammox) and methane oxidation reactions with nitrite as an electron acceptor is of great significance for the global carbon and nitrogen cycle. This study aims to explore the effects of different tillage modes on the abundance and community structure of anammox bacteria and anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME-2d), and anaerobic methane-oxidation rate in paddy fields to manage the paddy fields sustainably and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.MethodsThe abundance and community structure of anammox bacteria and ANME-2d, and anaerobic methane-oxidation rate were investigated in a 0-100 cm depth of paddy soil under three tillage modes: conventional paddy-upland rotation tillage (CT), combing ridge with no-tillage (RNT), and flooded paddy fields (FPF).ResultThe highest abundance of anammox bacteria was recorded under RNT (2.35 x 10(5) - 6.01 x 10(6) gene copies g(-1) dry soil). The 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of ANME-2d archaea under CT, RNT and FPF were 3.68 x 10(5) - 2.20 x 10(6), 4.92 x 10(5) - 3.54 x 10(6) and 5.79 x 10(5) - 5.19 x 10(6) gene copies g(-1) dry soil, respectively. The community compositions of anammox bacteria varied with tillage modes. In the CT mode, three species namely: Candidatus (Ca). Brocadia fulgida, Ca. Brocadia anammoxidans, and Ca. Kuenenia were detected, while Ca. Brocadia fulgida, Ca. Brocadia I and Ca. Brocadia II species were detected in the RNT. Two species of Ca. Brocadia fulgida and Ca. Jettenia were detected in the FPF. The species Ca. Brocadia was dominant and found in all tillage modes. All of the sequences in the three tillage modes were ANME-2d. The net methane-oxidation rate in RNT was two times higher than the other two tillage modes.ConclusionOur findings demonstrated that RNT mode increased the abundance of anammox bacteria and ANME-2d, improved soil fertility and increased the net methane-oxidation rate of the soil. This study thus provides a reliable practice for expanding RNT to rice cultivation for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Tripled plant productivity and soil microbiome restructuring in a greenhouse volcanic ash fertilization experiment
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Volcanic ash is widely held responsible for fertilizing soils, but the processes and conditions leading to volcanic soil fertility remain poorly understood. We report here the results of a greenhouse volcanic ash fertilization (VAF) experiment aimed to explore the impact of basaltic ash addition (0-10 wt%) to soil on plant growth, nutrient uptake, and the soil microbiome. Our four-month experiment with the Coleus species Plectranthus scutellarioides on forest soil revealed a non-linear growth response with distinct growth patterns below and above 3 wt% ash addition, respectively. Low ash VAF (<3 wt% ash) had a negligible growth impact, while high ash addition yielded a threefold increase in biomass production, reproductive effort, and total nutrient uptake in aboveground plant biomass. An increased uptake of nutrients that are not part of the ash itself (e.g., nitrogen) implies that VAF was not a direct nutrient addition process but rather acts indirectly. The soil microbiome composition (16S rRNA; Bacteria/Archaea, and 18S rRNA; Eukaryota, rRNA gene markers) also changed at >3 wt% ash concentrations, with no apparent further change with increasing ash content. Key changes were not only an increased relative abundance of several potentially plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria and fungi but also a decreased nematode abundance, suggesting that changes in the microbiome are likely a major factor for the substantial VAF effect observed in our experiment. We conclude that VAF with basaltic ash offers substantial potential benefits for agriculture as well as post-eruptive plant productivity on soils possibly associated with significant CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere. However, VAF is a complex process that does not act by simple nutrient addition from its chemical inventory but rather acts by restructuring the soil growth environment.

TI  - Elevated temperature shifts soil N cycling from microbial immobilization to enhanced mineralization, nitrification and denitrification across global terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - We assessed the response of soil microbial nitrogen (N) cycling and associated functional genes to elevated temperature at the global scale. A meta-analysis of 1,270 observations from 134 publications indicated that elevated temperature decreased soil microbial biomass N and increased N mineralization rates, both in the presence and absence of plants. These findings infer that elevated temperature drives microbially mediated N cycling processes from dominance by anabolic to catabolic reaction processes. Elevated temperature increased soil nitrification and denitrification rates, leading to an increase in N2O emissions of up to 227%, whether plants were present or not. Rates of N mineralization, denitrification and N2O emission demonstrated significant positive relationships with rates of CO(2)emissions under elevated temperatures, suggesting that microbial N cycling processes were associated with enhanced microbial carbon (C) metabolism due to soil warming. The response in the abundance of relevant genes to elevated temperature was not always consistent with changes in N cycling processes. While elevated temperature increased the abundances of thenirSgene with plants andnosZgenes without plants, there was no effect on the abundances of the ammonia-oxidizing archaeaamoAgene, ammonia-oxidizing bacteriaamoAandnirKgenes. This study provides the first global-scale assessment demonstrating that elevated temperature shifts N cycling from microbial immobilization to enhanced mineralization, nitrification and denitrification in terrestrial ecosystems. These findings infer that elevated temperatures have a profound impact on global N cycling processes with implications of a positive feedback to global climate and emphasize the close linkage between soil microbial C and N cycling.

TI  - Drying, more than warming, alters ecosystem functioning in streams with different energy pathways
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Empirical evidence and theory suggest that climate warming and an increase in the frequency and duration of drying events will alter the metabolic balance of freshwater ecosystems. However, the impacts of climate change on ecosystem metabolism may depend on whether energy inputs are of autochthonous or allochthonous origin. To date, few studies have examined how warming and drying may interact to alter stream metabolism, much less how their impacts may depend on the energy-base of the food web.
   2. To address this research gap, we conducted a multi-factorial experiment using outdoor mesocosms to investigate the individual and synergistic effects of warming and drought on metabolic processes in stream mesocosms with green (algal-based) vs. mixed (algal-and detritus-based) vs. brown (detritus-based) energy pathways.
   3. We set up 48 mesocosms with one of three different levels of shade and leaf litter input combinations to create mesocosms with different primary energy channels. In addition, we warmed half of the mesocosms by similar to 2-3 degrees C. We assessed changes in ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and organic matter biomass in warmed and ambient temperature mesocosms before a 24 day drying event and after rewetting.
   4. Surprisingly, experimental warming had little effect on metabolic processes. Drying, however, led to decreased rates of ER and GPP and led to an overall reduction in NEP. Although the effects of drying were similar across energy channel treatments, reductions in ER and GPP were primarily driven by decreases in biomass of benthic and filamentous algae.
   5. Overall, we demonstrate that drying led to lower rates of NEP in mesocosms regardless of energy inputs. While warming showed little effect in our study, our results suggest that an increase in the frequency of stream drying events could greatly alter the metabolic balance of many aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Soil type determines the abundance and community structure of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea in flooded paddy soils
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - Ammonia oxidation plays an important role in global nitrogen cycle. However, little information is available on ammonia oxidizers in paddy soils. This study aimed to understand the controlling factors of ammonia oxidizers in the paddy soils.
   Three types of paddy soils were collected from southwest [Chongqing City (CQ)], central [Honghu City (HH)], and northeast [Panjin City (PJ)] of China, respectively. The soils were cultured with unplanted and rice-planted pot experiments for 10 weeks. The abundance and composition of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) of the paddy soil samples were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis approaches based on amoA genes.
   In this study, minor changes in the abundance and community structure of both AOB and AOA were observed among the treatments of unplanted and rhizosphere and bulk of rice-planted soil samples in the same type of paddy soil. The AOB population sizes in CQ were lower than those in HH and PJ, while the AOA in CQ and HH were lower than those in PJ. The amoA gene copy numbers of AOA were more abundant than those of AOB in all treatments of the three paddy soils. The community structure of both AOB and AOA in all paddy soils was different from each other.
   The population size and community structure of AOB and AOA in the flooded paddy soils were mainly determined by the soil types, irrespective of rice-planted or unplanted.

TI  - Biochar addition affected the dynamics of ammonia oxidizers and nitrification in microcosms of a coastal alkaline soil
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB  - Biochar amendments have frequently been reported to alter microbial communities and biogeochemical processes in soils. However, the impact of biochar application on bacterial (AOB) and archaeal ammonia oxidizers (AOA) remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the responses of AOB and AOA to the application of biochar derived from cotton stalk at rates of 5, 10, and 20 % by weight to a coastal alkaline soil during a 12-week incubation. The results showed that the amoA gene of AOB consistently outnumbered that of AOA, whereas only the AOA amoA gene copy number was significantly correlated with the potential ammonia oxidation (PAO) rate (P < 0.01). The significant decrease of PAO rates in biochar treatments occurred after incubation for 4-6 weeks, which were distinctly longer than that in the control (2 weeks). The PAO rates were significantly different among treatments during the first 4 weeks of incubation (P < 0.05), with the highest usually in the 10 % treatment. Biochar application significantly increased the abundance of both nitrifiers in the 4 weeks of incubation (P < 0.05). Biochar amendment also decreased AOA diversity, but increased AOB diversity, which resulted in different community structures of both nitrifiers (P < 0.01), as shown by the differences between the 5 % biochar and the control treatments. We conclude that biochar application generally enhanced the abundance and altered the composition of ammonia oxidizers; the rate of biochar application also affected the rate and dynamics of nitrification, and the risk for increasing the alkalinity and N leaching of the studied soil was lower with a lower application rate.

TI  - Grazing exclusion alters soil microbial respiration, root respiration and the soil carbon balance in grasslands of the Loess Plateau, northern China
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Grassland ecosystems are a significant component of the global carbon cycle. To better understand how grazing affects the carbon cycle of grasslands, soil microbial respiration (Rm) and root respiration (Rr), which are the main soil respiration components, we investigated with a trenching method in grazed grasslands (GG) and fenced (FG) grasslands on the Loess Plateau, northern China in 2008. The annual carbon balance in the two grasslands were also assessed and compared. After exclusion of grazing for about 3years, soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in the surface soil increased significantly (P<0.05), resulting in the increase of Rm in most seasons. Exclusion of grazing did not change the diurnal variations of Rm, Rr and total soil respiration (Rt). Grazing decreased the temperature dependence of Rm. The annual accumulations of Rm were 165.9gCm(-2) in FG and 116.1gCm(-2) in GG. On most dates, Rr in FG was higher than in GG, but significant differences were only found in some seasons. The seasonal average value of Rr was 0.374 mu mol carbon dioxide (CO2) m(-2)s(-1) in FG, 21.0% higher than that in GG (0.309 mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)). Net primary production (NPP) in FG and GG were 243.6 and 205.8gCm(-2), respectively. The annual C balance resulted in net C sequestrations of 77.7 and 89.7gC m(-2) in FG and GG, respectively, suggesting that the grassland in this region may act as a C sink both under grazing and fencing.

TI  - Compost Addition Attenuates the Negative Impacts of High Soil Mineral Nitrogen Levels on Rhizosphere Microbial Characteristics and Enhances Cucumber Growth in Monoculture Systems
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Due to the increase in the human population, it is necessary to seek efficient methods of increasing crop productivity and, simultaneously, sustaining the soil. One way is to grow high demand crops continuously without rotating with other crops. This practice is often accompanied by increased rates of fertilizer application that can affect efficient nitrogen (N) cycling in the plant rhizosphere soil which, in turn, affects both plant growth and environmental pollution. In the present study, twelve various cucumber soils were selected from monoculture systems presenting different cropping years and divided into two groups including soils with relatively high mineral N (HMN) content (N > 100 mg kg(-1) soil) and those with a lower mineral N (LMN) content (N < 100 mg kg(-1) soil). All soils were amended with the addition of compost alone or in combination with bacterial inoculation to evaluate their effects on plant growth, microbial numbers, N mineralization, and N cycling genes. In general, the HMN soils increased (p < 0.05) net N mineralization (NNM) but did not statistically (p > 0.05) affect plant biomass compared to the LMN soils; however, compost addition increased both NNM and plant biomass in the HMN soils. In addition, the HMN soils had higher fungal pathogen numbers (FPNs) but lower total microbial biomass (TMB) and bacterial numbers (BNs) compared to the LMN soils; however, compost addition decreased FPNs but increased TMB and BNs in the HMN soils (all p < 0.05). Plant biomass was positively related to TMB, BN and NNM but was negatively related to FPN (all p < 0.05). In summary, compost addition reduced the high mineral N levels' adverse effects on the rhizosphere soil and plant growth.

TI  - Coupled moisture and microbial dynamics in unsaturated soils
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB  - A continuum-scale mathematical model which couples water flow and bacterial dynamics explores the process of biological clogging in unsaturated soils. The impact of biomass dynamics on soil water flow is assumed to take place through the changes in porosity and the structural properties of the medium by suitable modifications of the pore size distribution, water retention, and hydraulic conductivity functions. The feedback of soil moisture on biomass is taken into account by including the effect of water stress on microbial growth. The model is calibrated against existing laboratory experimental data for an artificial porous medium in saturated conditions, and it is used to analyze the hydraulic behavior of unsaturated soils when subject to biological clogging and plant water uptake. The results of this analysis show that this feedback may have a substantial impact on the net water flow, the soil water-holding capacity, and the soil moisture and biomass space-time distributions.

TI  - Vertical differentiation drives the changes in the main microflora and metabolites of carbon and nitrogen cycling in the early freeze-thaw period in the Qinghai Lake Basin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Global climate change has altered the frequency of soil freeze-thaw cycles, but the response of soil microorganisms to different elevation gradients during the early freeze-thaw period remains unclear. So far, the influence of the altitudinal gradient on the microbial community and metabolic characteristics in the early freeze-thaw period of the Qinghai Lake Basin remains unclear. To this end, we collected soil at different elevations in the early freeze-thaw period of the Qinghai Lake Basin and investigated the influence of the elevation gradient on soil microbial community characteristics and soil metabolic processes as well as the corresponding environmental driving mechanism by high-throughput sequencing and LC-MS (Liquid Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer) nontargeted metabolite determination. The results showed that Proteobacteria were the dominant microflora in the Qinghai Lake Basin. The dominant phyla associated with carbon and nitrogen are Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, both of which are significantly affected by elevation. The soil physicochemical factors jointly affected the soil microbial communities and metabolism. Total phosphorus nitrate nitrogen and pH were the main driving factors of the microbial community, and metabolites were sensitive to changes in chemical factors. In short, the microbial community structure and function, soil physicochemical factors and soil metabolic processes were significantly affected by the altitudinal gradient in the early freeze-thaw period, while the microbial community diversity showed no significant response to the altitudinal gradient. Additionally, a high potassium content in the soil may promote the growth and reproduction of bacteria associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling, as well as the production of metabolites.

TI  - Sphingomonas sp. Hbc-6 alters Arabidopsis metabolites to improve plant growth and drought resistance by manipulating the microbiome
T2  - MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Drought significantly affects crop productivity and poses a considerable threat to agricultural ecosystems. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) and plant microbiome play important roles in improving drought resistance and plant performance. However, the response of the rhizosphere microbiota to PGPB during the development of plants and the interaction between inoculum, microbiota, and plants under drought stress remain to be explored. In the present study, we used culturomic, microbiomic, and metabonomic analyses to uncover the mechanisms by which Sphingomonas sp. Hbc-6, a PGPB, promotes Arabidopsis growth and enhances drought resistance. We found that the rhizosphere microbiome assembly was interactively influenced by developmental stage, Hbc-6, and drought; the bacterial composition exhibited three patterns of shifts with developmental stage: resilience, increase, and decrease. Drought diminished microbial diversity and richness, whereas Hbc-6 increased microbial diversity and helped plants recruit specific beneficial bacterial taxa at each developmental stage, particularly during the bolting stage. Some microorganisms enriched by Hbc-6 had the potential to promote carbon and nitrogen cycling processes, and 86.79 % of the isolated strains exhibited PGP characteristics (for example Pseudomonas sp. TA9). They jointly regulated plant physiological metabolism (i.e., upregulated drought resistantfacilitating substances and reduced harmful substances), thereby stimulating the growth of Arabidopsis and increasing plant biomass under drought stress conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that Hbc-6 mediates plant growth and drought resistance by affecting the microbiome. The study thus provides novel insights and strain resources for drought-resistant, high-yielding crop cultivation and breeding.

TI  - Forest Fragmentation Slows the Decomposition of Coarse Woody Debris in a Subtropical Forest
T2  - FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Forest fragmentation is increasing rapidly around the world, and edge effects caused by fragmented forests can influence ecosystem functions and ecological processes, including coarse woody debris (CWD) decomposition. Understanding the influencing mechanisms of edge effect on CWD decomposition is needed to assess the effects of forest fragmentation on carbon cycling and storage. We measured rates of mass loss of CWD of Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. and Pinus taiwanensis Hayata over two years at two distances (0-5 m versus 60 m) from a forest edge at two altitudes (215 and 1,400 m a.s.l.), in a subtropical forest. In addition, we determined the microbial community of each CWD segment and the soil beneath via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Mass loss of CWD 60 m from the forest edge was 15% greater than that at the edge (0-5 m). Mass loss was positively correlated with the abundance of microbial and fauna community and moisture content of the decaying CWD. Distance from edge explained 17.4% of the total variation of the microbial abundance in CWD. The results indicate that the reduced abundance of microbial and fauna communities and moisture content at forest edges influenced rates of decomposition of CWD. Long-term experiments with more tree species and more forest types are needed to better assess edge effects generally.

TI  - Agricultural Management Practices Affect the Abundance of Markers of Phosphorus Cycle in Soil: Case Study with Pigeonpea and Soybean
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Soil fertility is disrupted by diverse anthropogenic activities, including intensive agricultural practices (viz., conventional agriculture (CT)), affecting environmental sustainability. Hence, for sustainability, alternative agricultural practices, such as conservation agriculture (CA) and organic agriculture (OA) that can preserve the native soil microbiome and enhance soil fertility, need to be adopted. This study aimed to assess the impacts of three farming practices on rhizospheric bacterial guilds involved in the phosphorus cycle. Extensive field experiments were performed with two crops, pigeonpea and soybean, over three consecutive cropping years (2017-2019), with nine modules under three agricultural practices (CA, OA, and CT). The modules varied in tillage, crop rotation, crop residue retention, crop establishment methods, and nutrient management. The impact of agricultural practices was assessed on rhizospheric bacterial guilds involved in P cycle by quantifying genes for P solubilization (pqqC) and mineralization (phoD), and on P uptake by plants, as P cycle holds a crucial role in maintaining soil fertility. Compared to the other two agricultural practices, CA exhibited a positive effect on the attributes (e.g. ICM7 showed 1.16-1.73 fold and 1.15-1.85 fold increment in pigeonpea and soybean, respectively, in terms of plant P uptake compared to other CT- and OA-based modules) analysed. The study offers a possible explanation for more efficient nutrient cycle in the rhizosphere under CA-based practice (comprising of zero-tillage, raised bed, crop residue retention, amendment with NPK nutrients) by enhancement of the rhizospheric bacterial guilds involved in P cycle, thereby also influencing the P uptake by plants.

TI  - MicroGraphBERT: soil microbial gene sequence classification via fusing taxonomic hierarchies and DNABERTbased contextual embeddings
T2  - INTELLIGENCE & ROBOTICS
AB  - Soil microbial communities are crucial for essential ecosystem functions such as nitrogen cycling and organic matter decomposition. However, accurately classifying their gene sequences remains challenging due to overlooked taxonomic hierarchies, environmental variability, and insufficient structural dynamics. Current methods predominantly focus on intra-sequence nucleotide features while neglecting the community's hierarchical taxonomy. To address these gaps, we analyzed soil samples collected from the loess regions of Guizhou and investigated dynamic changes in microbial community composition across plant growth stages. We propose MicroGraphBERT, a deep learning framework synergizing DNABERT's context-aware embeddings with taxonomy-aware priors via graph attention network to enable joint modeling of sequence and ecological features for microbial classification. Trained on high-throughput sequencing data from the Guizhou loess regions, MicroGraphBERT integrates nucleotide-level contextual semantics from DNABERT and cross-species relational learning with graph attention network to capture both sequence features and taxonomic hierarchies. This approach identifies complex microbial patterns under varying soil conditions, achieving a classification accuracy of 98.72%. Our work advances precision microbiome analytics by providing a scalable solution for soil health monitoring, intelligent fertilizer optimization, and sustainable agroecosystem management.

TI  - Microbial mechanisms for CO2 and CH4 emissions in Robinia pseudoacacia forests along a North-South transect in the Loess Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest soil microbes play a crucial role in regulating atmospheric-soil carbon fluxes. Environmental heterogeneity across forest types and regions may lead to differences in soil CO2 2 and CH4 4 emissions. However, the microbial mechanisms underlying these emission variations are currently unclear. In this study, we measured CO2 2 and CH4 4 emissions of Robinia pseudoacacia forests along a north-south transect in the Loess Plateau. Using metagenomic sequencing, we investigated the structural and functional profiles of soil carbon cycling microbial communities. Results indicated that the forest CO2 2 emissions of Robinia pseudoacacia was significantly higher in the north region than in the south region, while the CH4 4 emission was oppositely. This is mainly attributed to changes in gene abundance driven by soil pH and moisture in participating carbon degradation and methane oxidation processes across different forest regions. The gene differences in carbon fixation processes between regions primarily stem from the Calvin cycle, where the abundance of rbcL, rbcS, and prkB genes dominates microbial carbon fixation in forest soils. Random forest models revealed key genes involved in predicting forest soil CO2 2 emissions, including SGA1 and amyA for starch decomposition, TYR for lignin decomposition, chitinase for chitin decomposition, and pectinesterase for pectin decomposition. Microbial functional characterization revealed that interregional differences in CH4 4 emissions during methane metabolism may originate from methane oxidation processes, and the associated gene abundances (glyA, ppc, and pmoB) were key genes for predicting CH4 4 emissions from forest soils. Our results provide new insights into the microbial mechanisms of CO2 2 and CH4 4 emissions from forest soils, which will be crucial for accurate prediction of the forest soil carbon cycle in the future.

TI  - From Young to Over-Mature: Long-Term Cultivation Effects on the Soil Nutrient Cycling Dynamics and Microbial Community Characteristics Across Age Chronosequence of Schima superba Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Optimizing forest management requires a comprehensive understanding of how soil properties and microbial communities evolve across different plantation ages. This study examines variations in soil nutrient dynamics, enzyme activities, and bacterial communities in Schima superba Gardn. & Champ plantations of 10, 15, 27, 55, and 64 years. By analyzing soil from depths of 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm, we identified significant age-related trends in soil characteristics. Notably, nutrient contents, including total organic carbon (TOC), total phosphorus (TP), total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), as well as soil water content (SWC), peaked in 55-year-old mature plantations and decreased in 64-year-old over-mature plantations. Enzyme activities, such as urease, sucrase, and acid phosphatase, decreased with soil depth and exhibited notable differences across stand ages. Microbial community analysis indicated the predominance of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiota in nutrient cycling, with their relative abundances varying significantly with age and depth. Mature and over-mature plantations exhibited higher absolute abundances of functional genes related to methane metabolism, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycling. Reduced calcium ion levels were also linked to lower gene abundance in carbon degradation, carbon fixation, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling, while increased TOC, NH4+-N, NO3--N, and AP correlated with higher gene abundance in methane metabolism and phosphorus cycling. Our findings suggest that long-term cultivation of Schima superba enhances soil nutrient cycling. Calcium ion was identified as a significant factor in assessing soil properties and microbial dynamics across different stand ages, suggesting that extended plantation rotations can improve soil health and nutrient cycling.

TI  - Comparative analysis of basidiomycete transcriptomes reveals a core set of expressed genes encoding plant biomass degrading enzymes
T2  - FUNGAL GENETICS AND BIOLOGY
AB  - Basidiomycete fungi can degrade a wide range of plant biomass, including living and dead trees, forest litter, crops, and plant matter in soils. Understanding the process of plant biomass decay by basidiomycetes could facilitate their application in various industrial sectors such as food & feed, detergents and biofuels, and also provide new insights into their essential biological role in the global carbon cycle. The fast expansion of basidiomycete genomic and functional genomics data (e.g. transcriptomics, proteomics) has facilitated exploration of key genes and regulatory mechanisms of plant biomass degradation. In this study, we comparatively analyzed 22 transcriptome datasets from basidiomycetes related to plant biomass degradation, and identified 328 commonly induced genes and 318 repressed genes, and defined a core set of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), which was shared by most of the basidiomycete species. High conservation of these CAZymes in genomes and similar regulation pattern in transcriptomics data from lignocellulosic substrates indicate their key role in plant biomass degradation and need for their further biochemical investigation.

TI  - Effects of predator functional diversity on grassland ecosystem function
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Predator species individually are known to have important effects on plant communities and ecosystem functions such as production, decomposition, and elemental cycling, the nature of which is determined by a key functional trait, predator hunting mode. However, it remains entirely uncertain how predators with different hunting modes combine to influence ecosystem function. I report on an experiment conducted in a New England grassland ecosystem that quantified the net effects of a sit-and-wait and an actively hunting spider species on the plant composition and functioning of a New England grassland ecosystem. I manipulated predator functional diversity by varying the dominance ratio of the two predator species among five treatments using a replacement series design. Experimentation revealed that predator functional diversity effects propagated down the live plant-based chain to affect the levels of plant diversity, and plant litter quality, elemental cycling, and production. Moreover, many of these effects could be approximately by the weighted average of the individual predator species effects, suggesting that this kind of predator diversity effect on ecosystems is not highly nonlinear.

TI  - Surface temperatures reveal the patterns of vegetation water stress and their environmental drivers across the tropical Americas
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Vegetation is a key component in the global carbon cycle as it stores similar to 450 GtC as biomass, and removes about a third of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, in some regions, the rate of plant carbon uptake is beginning to slow, largely because of water stress. Here, we develop a new observation-based methodology to diagnose vegetation water stress and link it to environmental drivers. We used the ratio of remotely sensed land surface to near surface atmospheric temperatures (LST/T-air) to represent vegetation water stress, and built regression tree models (random forests) to assess the relationship between LST/T-air and the main environmental drivers of surface energy fluxes in the tropical Americas. We further determined ecosystem traits associated with water stress and surface energy partitioning, pinpointed critical thresholds for water stress, and quantified changes in ecosystem carbon uptake associated with crossing these critical thresholds. We found that the top drivers of LST/T-air explaining over a quarter of its local variability in the study region, are (1) radiation, in 58% of the study region; (2) water supply from precipitation, in 30% of the study region; and (3) atmospheric water demand from vapor pressure deficits (VPD), in 22% of the study region. Regions in which LST/T-air variation is driven by radiation are located in regions of high aboveground biomass or at high elevations, while regions in which LST/T-air is driven by water supply from precipitation or atmospheric demand tend to have low species richness. Carbon uptake by photosynthesis can be reduced by up to 80% in water-limited regions when critical thresholds for precipitation and air dryness are exceeded simultaneously, that is, as compound events. Our results demonstrate that vegetation structure and diversity can be important for regulating surface energy and carbon fluxes over tropical regions.

TI  - Conversion of grassland to coniferous woodland has limited effects on soil nitrogen cycle processes
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - In the last century, conversion of native North American grasslands to Juniperus virginiana forests or woodlands has dramatically altered ecosystem Structure and significantly increased ecosystem carbon (C) stocks. We compared soils under recently established J. virginiana forests and adjacent native C-4-dominated grassland to assess changes in potential soil nitrogen (N) transformations and plant available N. Over a 2-year period, concentrations of extractable inorganic N were measured in soils from forest and grassland sites. Potential gross N ammonification, nitrification, and consumption rates were determined using N-15 isotope-dilution under laboratory conditions, controlling for soil temperature and moisture content. Potential nitrification rates (V-max) and microbial biomass, as well as soil physical and chemical properties were also assessed. Extractable NH4+ concentrations were significantly greater in grassland soils across the Study period (P <= 0.01), but analysis by date indicated that differences in extractable inorganic N occurred more frequently in fall and winter, when grasses were senescent but J. virginiana was still active. Laboratory-based rates of gross N mineralization (ammonification) and nitrification were greater in grassland soils (P <= 0.05), but only on one of four dates. Potential nitrification rates (V-max) were art order of magnitude greater than gross nitrification rates in both ecosystems, suggesting that nitrification is highly constrained by NH4+ availability. Differences in plant uptake of N, C inputs, and soil microclimate as forests replace grasslands may influence plant available N in the field, as evidenced by seasonal differences in soil extractable NH4+, and total soil C and N accumulation. However, we found few differences in potential soil N transformations under laboratory conditions, suggesting that this grassland-to-forest conversion caused little change in mineralizable organic N pools or potential microbial activity.

TI  - Insight into the microbial nitrogen cycle in riparian soils in an agricultural region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Riparian zones are considered as an effective measure on preventing agricultural non-point source nitrogen (N) pollution. However, the mechanism underlying microbial N removal and the characteristics of N-cycle in riparian soils remain elusive. In this study, we systematically monitored the soil potential nitrification rate (PNR), denitrification potential (DP), as well as net N2O production rate, and further used metagenomic sequencing to elucidate the mechanism underlying microbial N removal. As a whole, the riparian soil had a very strong denitrification, with the DP 3.17 times higher than the PNR and 13.82 times higher than the net N2O production rate. This was closely related to the high soil NO3--N content. In different profiles, due to the influence of extensive agricultural activities, the soil DP, PNR, and net N2O production rate near the farmland edge were relatively low. In terms of N-cycling microbial community composition, the taxa of denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and assimilatory nitrate reduction accounted for a large proportion, all related to NO3--N reduction. The N-cycling microbial community in waterside zone showed obvious differences to the landside zone. The abundances of N-fixation and anammox genes were significantly higher in the waterside zone, while the abundances of nitrification (amoA&B&C) and urease genes were significantly higher in the landside zone. Furthermore, the groundwater table was an important biogeochemical hotspot in the waterside zone, the abundance of N-cycle genes near the groundwater table was at a relative higher level. In addition, compared to different soil depths, greater variation in N-cycling microbial community composition was observed between different profiles. These results reveal some characteristics of the soil microbial N-cycle in the riparian zone in an agricultural region and are helpful for restoration and management of the riparian zone.

TI  - Comparative analysis of organic carbon forms and their availability in diverse wetland ecosystems of Nantong, China
T2  - WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Wetlands are vital ecosystems for global carbon cycling and storage, acting as significant carbon reservoirs that surpass many other ecosystems in their capacity to sequester carbon. This study investigates the availability and distribution of various forms of organic carbon across different wetland types in Nantong, China, including coastal, freshwater riverine, saltwater riverine, and inland lake wetlands. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for soil organic carbon (SOC), Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), Particulate Organic Carbon (POC), Mineral-Associated Organic Carbon (MAOC), And Easily Oxidizable Organic Carbon (EOC). The results reveal that coastal wetlands exhibit the highest mean SOC (19.8974 mg/g) and DOC (0.2585 mg/g) concentrations, indicating their significant role in carbon sequestration. Meanwhile, freshwater riverine wetlands have the highest mean POC (8.3611 mg/g), highlighting their importance in particulate organic carbon storage. Saltwater riverine wetlands demonstrate significant carbon sequestration potential, with the highest total carbon content (122.53 mg/g). Correlation analysis shows that the levels of ammonia are positively related to SOC, DOC, MAOC, and EOC. This means that the ammonia levels encourage microbes to work harder and break down organic matter faster. Conversely, nitrite levels negatively impact SOC, DOC, and MAOC. These findings underscore the importance of wetland type and environmental conditions in determining carbon storage and turnover. The study provides critical insights for wetland conservation and management strategies aimed at mitigating climate change and preserving biodiversity.Practitioner Points Coastal wetlands show the highest mean SOC and DOC, indicating significant carbon sequestration potential and nutrient availability. Freshwater riverine wetlands have the highest POC levels, highlighting their role in particulate organic matter accumulation. Saltwater riverine wetlands demonstrate substantial total carbon content, showing resilience in saline conditions. Ammonia positively influences SOC, DOC, MAOC, and EOC, enhancing microbial activity and organic matter decomposition. Variability in carbon content across wetland types emphasizes the need for tailored conservation and management strategies.

TI  - Combining Sample Designs to Account for the Whole Necromass Carbon Stock in Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
AB  - Necromass is crucial to understanding both carbon and nutrient cycling throughout the forest. In this study, we assessed the carbon stock and spatial distribution of necromass components in an Atlantic rainforest, southern Brazil, one hotspot of biodiversity. Necromass comprised: standing dead trees and stumps (SWN), large-sized woody necromass (LWN), medium-sized woody necromass (MWN), and litter (LTR). Specific sample designs assessed each component, while the Payandeh index indicated spatial distribution. Mean wood densities of LWN ranged from 0.24 to 0.46 g.cm(-3), and mean carbon fraction ranged from 0.42 to 0.44 gC.g(-1) d.m. depending on decay class. The total necromass carbon stock was 12.83 MgC.ha(-1). SWN, LWN, MWN, and LTR carbon stores were 3.15, 4.24, 1.50, and 3.53 MgC.ha(-1), respectively. LWN and MWN showed a reverse J-curve skewed carbon stock distribution and clumped spatial pattern. LTR presented asymmetric distribution and a random spatial pattern. Coarse and heavy necromass is clumped near dead trees, while the wind scatters fine necromass throughout the forest. This study provides useful information to the understanding of the carbon cycle in Atlantic rainforests and may be helpful to improve the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases and the Global Forest Resource Assessment.

TI  - Pathways of mineral-associated soil organic matter formation: Integrating the role of plant carbon source, chemistry, and point of entry
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - To predict the behavior of the terrestrial carbon cycle, it is critical to understand the source, formation pathway, and chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM). There is emerging consensus that slow-cycling SOM generally consists of relatively low molecular weight organic carbon substrates that enter the mineral soil as dissolved organic matter and associate with mineral surfaces (referred to as "mineral-associated OM," or MAOM). However, much debate and contradictory evidence persist around: (a) whether the organic C substrates within the MAOM pool primarily originate from aboveground vs. belowground plant sources and (b) whether C substrates directly sorb to mineral surfaces or undergo microbial transformation prior to their incorporation into MAOM. Here, we attempt to reconcile disparate views on the formation of MAOM by proposing a spatially explicit set of processes that link plant C source with MAOM formation pathway. Specifically, because belowground vs. aboveground sources of plant C enter spatially distinct regions of the mineral soil, we propose that fine-scale differences in microbial abundance should determine the probability of substrate-microbe vs. substrate-mineral interaction. Thus, formation of MAOM in areas of high microbial density (e.g., the rhizosphere and other microbial hotspots) should primarily occur through an in vivo microbial turnover pathway and favor C substrates that are first biosynthesized with high microbial carbon-use efficiency prior to incorporation in the MAOM pool. In contrast, in areas of low microbial density (e.g., certain regions of the bulk soil), MAOM formation should primarily occur through the direct sorption of intact or partially oxidized plant compounds to uncolonized mineral surfaces, minimizing the importance of carbon-use efficiency, and favoring C substrates with strong "sorptive affinity." Through this framework, we thus describe how the primacy of biotic vs. abiotic controls on MAOM dynamics is not mutually exclusive, but rather spatially dictated. Such an understanding may be integral to more accurately modeling soil organic matter dynamics across different spatial scales.

TI  - Genetic mosaics of ecosystem functioning across aspen-dominated landscapes
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Genetic diversity is the foundation of all biodiversity, and the genetic variation within species is increasingly recognized as being important to ecosystem level processes. Recent research demonstrates that plant genotype influences above- and belowground communities as well as basic ecosystem functions. However, the extent to which plant genotypes create spatial mosaics of genetically mediated ecosystem processes in natural forests is uncertain. We use Populus tremuloides as a model system to demonstrate the importance of plant genotype on carbon and nitrogen cycling in natural systems. We identified 24 distinct P. tremuloides clones with multiple ramets across 25 km(2) in southern Wisconsin, United States, using microsatellite makers. We then sampled clone leaf chemistry and belowground nutrient content and microbial extracellular enzyme activity. Aspen-induced variation in belowground carbon and nitrogen content, and microbial activity, varied widely among clones. Variation in green leaf chemistry and belowground microbial activity were correlated with genetic distance among clones, such that more genetically distant clones created more divergent patches of ecosystem processes. These data suggest that aspen genotypes create spatial mosaics of genetically mediated ecosystem functioning across natural landscapes and can therefore have evolutionary consequences for co-occurring species.

TI  - Earthworms and eco-consequences: Considerations to soil biological indicators and plant function: A review
T2  - ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA
AB  - Earthworms have been well reported to have a beneficial effect on soil microbes, soil microbial biomass (SMB), fungal community, soil structure, water retention and plant growth in different terrestrial ecosystems. However, the interactions between environmental stressors and various species of earthworms and the subsequent effect on soil microbes, organic matter, soil structure and plant growth are still uncertain. The purpose of this analysis was to test 1- the impact of environmental stressors on earthworm behaviour. 2- the effect of various earthworms on soil microbes, plant growth, soil structure and the carbon cycle. We noted that less fatal temperatures are generally unknown, but higher fatal temperatures range from 25 to 48 degrees C. Earthworms have a role to play, depending on the nature oforganic residues, in both the formation and degradation ofsoil aggregates. Improvements in microbial biomass and plant growth have been established according to temperature, soil toxicity, soil type, earthworms abundance, organic residues types and field conditions. We observed that although the summer temperature in the arid area was approximately (degrees C 48), it was found that a particular type of earthworm (Namalycastis indica) was responsible for improving soil characteristics.While a great deal of analysis has been carried out on the role of earthworms within the soil ecology, such a review identifies important knowledge gaps, particularly in the determination of the impacts of earthworm species on the soil structure, microbial biomass and plant productivity, in particular since most papers focused on European species and overlooked the role of earthworms in the arid landscape. Further research is recommended to compare the impacts of different earthworms species on soil microbes and plant growth in various soil types, earthworm abundance, field conditions, organic residues locations, inorganic fertilizers, pesticides, fertile or non-fertile soils and diverse conditions of drought and moisture.

TI  - Variability of Aboveground Litter Inputs Alters Soil Carbon and Nitrogen in a Coniferous-Broadleaf Mixed Forest of Central China
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Global changes and human disturbances can strongly affect the quantity of aboveground litter entering soils, which could result in substantial cascading effects on soil biogeochemical processes in forests. Despite extensive reports, it is unclear how the variations in litter depth affect soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. The responses of soil carbon and nitrogen to the variability of litter inputs were examined in a coniferous-broadleaf mixed forest of Central China. The litter input manipulation included five treatments: no litter input, natural litter, double litter, triple litter, and quadruple litter. Multifold litter additions decreased soil temperature but did not affect soil moisture after 2.5 years. Reductions in soil pH under litter additions were larger than increases under no litter input. Litter quantity did not affect soil total organic carbon, whereas litter addition stimulated soil dissolved organic carbon more strongly than no litter input suppressed it. The triggering priming effect of litter manipulation on soil respiration requires a substantial litter quantity, and the impacts of a slight litter change on soil respiration are negligible. Litter quantity did not impact soil total nitrogen, and only strong litter fluctuations changed the content of soil available nitrogen (nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen). Litter addition enhanced soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen more strongly than no litter input. Our results imply that the impacts of multifold litter inputs on soil carbon and nitrogen are different with a single litter treatment. These findings suggest that variability in aboveground litter inputs resulting from environmental change and human disturbances have great potential to change soil carbon and nitrogen in forest ecosystems. The variability of aboveground litter inputs needs to be taken into account to predict the responses of terrestrial soil carbon and nitrogen cycling to environmental changes and forest management.

TI  - Effect of biochar on nitrous oxide emission and its potential mechanisms
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
AB  - Extensive use of biochar to mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emission is limited by the lack of understanding on the exact mechanisms altering N2O emission from biochar-amended soil. Biochars produced from rice straw and dairy manure at 350 and 500 degrees C by oxygen-limited pyrolysis were used to investigate their influence on N2O emission. A quadratic effect of biochar levels was observed on the N2O emissions. The potential mechanisms were explored by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). A lower relative abundance of bacteria, which included ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), was observed at 4% biochar application rate. Reduced copy numbers of the ammonia monooxygenase gene amoA and the nitrite reductase gene nirS coincided with decreased N2O emissions. Therefore, biochar may potentially alter N2O emission by affecting ammonia-oxidizing and denitrification bacteria, which is determined by the application rate of biochar in soil.
   Implications: Biochar research has received increased interest in recent years because of the potential beneficial effects of biochar on soil properties. Recent research shows that biochar can alter the rates of nitrogen cycling in soil systems by influencing nitrification and denitrification, which are key sources of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). However, there are still some controversial data. The purpose of this research was to (1) examine how applications of different dose of biochar to soil affect emission of N2O and (2) improve the understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Distribution of phosphorus cycling genes across land uses and microbial taxonomic groups based on metagenome and genome mining
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an essential and limiting nutrient in soil and is tightly linked to soil fertility and productivity. Microorganisms have developed different mechanisms to respond to P scarcity and increase its availability in soil, which are susceptible to change under contrasting land uses. Here, we calculated and compared meta-genomic redundancy, as a measurement of ecosystem potential capacity, of 23 key functional genes related to organic P mineralization, inorganic P solubilization and P-starvation response regulation in forest, grassland and cropland soils through mining in public sequence repository. The redundancy of those genes in all currently published genomes (genome redundancy) from archaea, bacteria and fungi was also studied. Microbes in croplands and grasslands showed a higher potential (i.e., redundancy) to mineralize organic P through the action of alkaline phosphatases (phoA, phoD and phoX genes) and to solubilize inorganic P (gcd and pqqC) by producing gluconic acid than those in forests. Instead, the capacity of microbes to mineralize phosphonates through the action of C-P lyases (phnG, phnH, ..., phnM) was found to be higher in forests. The impact of land use on the metagenomic redundancy of genes encoding phytases (appA and 3-phytase) was dependent on the type of phytase. Intermetagenome redundancy (potentiality per metagenome unit) reached maximum values for phos-phatase production, P solubilization and regulation of P starvation, denoting the crucial role that these functions have in P cycling. Proteobacteria, within Bacteria, and Euryarchaeota, within Archaea, showed the greatest genomic potential to respond to P scarcity. However, the role of fungi seems to be more restricted. The present study provides an overview on how the microbial mechanisms that regulate P availability in soil potentially change with land use and taxonomy of microbes.

TI  - Interpreting, measuring, and modeling soil respiration
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - This paper reviews the role of soil respiration in determining ecosystem carbon balance, and the conceptual basis for measuring and modeling soil respiration. We developed it to provide background and context for this special issue on soil respiration and to synthesize the presentations and discussions at the workshop. Soil respiration is the largest component of ecosystem respiration. Because autotrophic and heterotrophic activity belowground is controlled by substrate availability, soil respiration is strongly linked to plant metabolism, photosynthesis and litterfall. This link dominates both base rates and short-term fluctuations in soil respiration and suggests many roles for soil respiration as an indicator of ecosystem metabolism. However, the strong links between above and belowground processes complicate using soil respiration to understand changes in ecosystem carbon storage. Root and associated mycorrhizal respiration produce roughly half of soil respiration, with much of the remainder derived from decomposition of recently produced root and leaf litter. Changes in the carbon stored in the soil generally contribute little to soil respiration, but these changes, together with shifts in plant carbon allocation, determine ecosystem carbon storage belowground and its exchange with the atmosphere. Identifying the small signal from changes in large, slow carbon pools in flux dominated by decomposition of recent material and autotrophic and mycorrhizal respiration is a significant challenge. A mechanistic understanding of the belowground carbon cycle and of the response of different components to the environment will aid in identifying this signal. Our workshop identified information needs to help build that understanding: (1) the mechanisms that control the coupling of canopy and belowground processes; (2) the responses of root and heterotrophic respiration to environment; (3) plant carbon allocation patterns, particularly in different forest developmental stages, and in response to treatments (warming, CO2, nitrogen additions); and (4) coupling measurements of soil respiration with aboveground processes and changes in soil carbon. Multi-factor experiments need to be sufficiently long to allow the systems to adjust to the treatments. New technologies will be necessary to reduce uncertainty in estimates of carbon allocation, soil carbon pool sizes, and different responses of roots and microbes to environmental conditions.

TI  - Silver nanoparticles altered soil respiration, enzyme activity, carbon use efficiency and microbial community in an upland soil
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are popular for their antimicrobial properties but their effects on soil carbon cycles remain unclear. This study explored AgNPs' impact on soil carbon dynamics and related microbial structures. Topsoil samples were treated with varying AgNPs concentrations (1, 10, 100, 500, and 1000 mg kg-1) over 56 days. Soil sampling was conducted at five time points (days 7, 14, 28, 42 and 56) to capture temporal changes. We assessed carbon mineralization, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and enzymatic activities, along with 13C-labeled DOC and 13C-phospholipid fatty acid assays for tracing microbial carbon assimilation and evaluating carbon use efficiency (CUE). Following exposure to AgNPs in Ag100, Ag500, and Ag1000 treatments, cumulative CO2 emissions and DOC content increased by 40.3 %-170.0 % and 46.9 %- 74.9 %, respectively. However, MBC decreased in Ag500 (63.8 %) and Ag1000 (63.0 %) treatments. Enzyme activities declined: (3-glucosidase (43.7 %-48.4 %), (3-xylosidase (48.9 %-79.7 %), and Cellobiohydrolase (50.8 %-97.6 %). Additionally, microbial CUE increased 49.7 % in Ag1000 treatment. Soil microbial communities exhibited significant alterations in response to AgNPs in Ag100, Ag500, and Ag1000 treatments as well. By day 56, the relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria and Actinomycetes decreased by 5.7 %-15.9 % and 9.7 %- 25.8 %, respectively, while Gram-negative bacteria increased significantly by 12.9 %-25.6 %. Meanwhile, the proportion of 13C-DOC derived C attributed to Gram-negative bacteria increased by 56.8 %-184.1 %, whereas Gram-positive bacteria (70.8 %-99.5 %) and Actinomycetes (64.2 %-82.3 %) decreased. These findings reveal the substantial role of AgNPs in altering soil carbon processes and microbial communities.

TI  - Soil depth and agricultural irrigation activities drive variation in microbial abundance and nitrogen cycling
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Understanding the vertical diversity and abundance of soil microorganisms in shifting environments is crucial for the improvement of crop yield, tackling climate change and optimizing biogeochemical cycles in the Earth's critical zone. In this study, a comprehensive survey of soil microbial communities was conducted in fields in an irrigated area and an abandoned area in western China. In total, 40 soil cores (600 cm deep) were taken from land under irrigation-fertilization management (IL; 34 cores) and abandoned land (AL; six cores) from July 2013 to April 2018. Spatiotemporal variation in the abundance of soil bacteria, fungi and nitrogen (N)-cycling microbes was evaluated. Soil depth was found to drive soil microbial abundance, but not diversity, throughout the vertical soil profile. The results suggest that in winter, the abundances were mainly driven by environmental variables (depth and temperature), but in summer, by depth, temperature and nutrient status. Depth had strong direct effects, and indirect impacts via temperature and TN, on microbial abundance in summer. The sequence counts for some prokaryotic taxa presented clear, mid-profile peaks in the vertical soil profiles. These distributions may be partially explained by soil texture. Consequently, the environmental filtering associated with depth controls local microbial abundance along resource gradients in the soil profile. Other factors, including temperature, moisture, pH and nutrients, were secondary regulators of microbial abundance. Further, irrigated agriculture land use could accelerate N cycling, increase nitrate leaching, and N2O and N-2 production. Such findings, which enhance our understanding of how soil microbial communities respond to environmental changes and N-cycling pathways in the deeper soil profile, could improve field nitrogen management.

TI  - Roots and Associated Fungi Drive Long-Term Carbon Sequestration in Boreal Forest
T2  - SCIENCE
AB  - Boreal forest soils function as a terrestrial net sink in the global carbon cycle. The prevailing dogma has focused on aboveground plant litter as a principal source of soil organic matter. Using C-14 bomb-carbon modeling, we show that 50 to 70% of stored carbon in a chronosequence of boreal forested islands derives from roots and root-associated microorganisms. Fungal biomarkers indicate impaired degradation and preservation of fungal residues in late successional forests. Furthermore, 454 pyrosequencing of molecular barcodes, in conjunction with stable isotope analyses, highlights root-associated fungi as important regulators of ecosystem carbon dynamics. Our results suggest an alternative mechanism for the accumulation of organic matter in boreal forests during succession in the long-term absence of disturbance.

TI  - Nitrogen removal through collaborativemicrobial pathways in tidal flow constructed wetlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Constructed wetlands are efficient in removing nitrogen from water; however, little is known about nitrogen-cycling pathways for nitrogen loss from tidal flow constructedwetlands. This study conductedmolecular and stable isotopic analyses to investigate potential dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), denitrification, nitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and their contributions to nitrogen removal by two tidal wetland mesocosms, PA (planted with Phragmites australis) and NP (unplanted), designated to treat Yangtze River Estuary water. Our results show the mesocosms removed similar to 22.6% of TN from nitrate-dominated river water (1.19 mg.L-1), with better performance obtained in PA than that in NP, which was consistent with the molecular and stable isotopic data. The potential activities ofDNRA, anammox, denitrification and nitrification varied between 0.6 and 1.6, 4.6-37.3, 36.4-305.7, and 463.7-945.9 nmol N-2 g(-1) dry soil d(-1), respectively, with higher values obtained in PA than NP. Nitrification accounted for 94.3-99.4% of NH4+ oxidation, with the rest through anammox. Denitrification contributed to 77.9-90.3% of NOx- reduction, compared to 9.2-21.6% and 0.5-1.5% via anammox and DNRA, respectively; 78.4-90.9% of N-2 was produced through denitrification, with the rest via anammox. Pearson correlation analyses suggest NH4+ was the major factor regulating nitrification, while NO3- played an important role in the competition between denitrification and DNRA, and NO2- was a key restrictive factor for anammox. Overall, this study reveals the importance of nitrification, denitrification, anammox and DNRA in nitrogen removal, providing new insight into the nitrogen-cycling mechanisms in natural/artificial tidal wetlands.

TI  - Effects of Different Organic Amendments on Soil Improvement, Bacterial Composition, and Functional Diversity in Saline-Sodic Soil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - The agricultural productivity of farmland in Northeast China's Liaohe Plain is restricted by the salinity and sodicity of the soils, which have additionally low organic matter content. In order to improve saline-sodic soils, organic amendments are frequently applied. Our objective was to clarify how different organic amendments affect the diversity and composition of soil microbes, as well as how these factors are related to crop yield. In 2020-2021, we conducted an experiment with different organic amendments. The treatments included the application of crop residue incorporation (SR), lignite humic acid (LHA; 6 ton/ha), or cow manure (FM; 30 ton/ha), and a control (CK). The results show that, compared with CK, the content of SOM in soil treated with organic amendments increased by 5.3-7.4 g/kg; the available potassium (AK) of the LHA treatment was significantly higher than that of the FM and SR treatments by 32.17 and 42.79 mg/kg, respectively; and the available phosphorus (AP) of the LHA treatment was significantly higher than that of the SR treatment by 7.19 mg/kg. The pH and EC1:5 values of the LHA treatment were significantly lower than those of CK by 1.36 units and 0.2 mS/cm, respectively. The application of organic amendments and changes in environmental conditions also significantly affected community structure and increased soil microbial richness and diversity. SR treatment increased the abundance of Acidobacteria. Further FAPROTAX (Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa) analysis showed that organic amendments can increase the abundance of microbes involved in the carbon and nitrogen cycle processes, such as aerobic_ammonia_oxidation, aerobic_chemoheterotrophy, nitrification, etc., which increases the kernel number per row and increases crop yield. LHA can increase the microbial abundance of the nitrogen cycle and reduce soil carbon mineralization, while also increasing soil nutrients and crop yield. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the application of organic amendments in saline-sodic cultivated land.

TI  - Spatial distribution of microbial community composition along a steep slope plot of the Loess Plateau
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Spatial heterogeneity of soil microbes introduces great uncertainty to our understanding of microbe-mediated soil carbon cycling, yet was few studied on sloping lands. Along a steep-slope grassland (35 degrees) on the Chinese Loess Plateau, soils of 0-10 cm were sampled in 2016 at three slope positions (upper, middle and bottom) to determine microbial community composition (by Illumina Hiseq sequencing) and function (enzymes involved in carbon cycling, the in situ soil respiration and temperature sensitivity). The bacterial alpha-diversity were greater at middle- and bottom- than at upper slope position, while fungal alpha-diversity varied little across slope positions. The bacterial phylum Proteobacteria was 9.7% and 19.4% lower but Acidobacteria was 36.5% and 41.3% greater at bottom- than at upper- and middle- slope positions. The fungal community transitioned from being Basidiomycota-dominant (relative abundance of 46.8%) at upper slope position to Zygomycota-dominant (relative abundance of 36.5%) at bottom slope position. The beta-D-glucosidase activity generally declined down the slope while beta-D-xylosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities hiked at middle slope position. All the enzyme activities were suppressed at bottom slope position. Soil respiration increased by 49.1% (P < 0.05) while temperature sensitivity decreased by 13.2% (P < 0.05) down the slope. Both bacterial richness (OTU) and diversity (Shannon diversity index) positively correlated with soil respiration. The copiotrophic groups (Acidobacteria and Zygomycota) negatively and oligotrophic groups (Proteobacteria and Basidiomycota) positively correlated with temperature sensitivity of soil respiration. Our findings revealed divergent responses of soil bacterial and fungal communities along the slope and highlighted the importance of microbial information in predicting the spatial variability of soil respiration in hillslope ecosystems.

TI  - Soil microbial biomass, community composition and soil nitrogen cycling in relation to tree species in subtropical China
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - We investigated microbial biomass and composition (lipid profile), mineral N pools and soil physico-chemical parameters in the top 5-cm soils 19 years after reforestation of Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) woodland with itself or a native broadleaf species, Mytilaria laosensis. The results suggested that tree species transition had a large impact on microbial biomass and a small impact on the composition of the microbial community as indicated by the relative abundance of individual lipid biomarkers. Between November 2011 and October 2012, there was on average 50% greater microbial biomass carbon (C) measured by the fumigation extraction procedure under M. laosensis than under C lanceolata. A one-time measurement of phospholipid fatty acids in soil samples collected in May 2012 suggested M. laosensis plots had greater content of individual lipid biomarkers than C lanceolata plots. Using a litter manipulation experiment, we found that the increases in content of lipid biomarkers under M. laosensis can be attributed to changed litter chemistry. Analysis of soil mineral N pools indicated that there were significantly lower NH4+ and NO3- pools as well as potential net N mineralization rates in M. laosensis soil than in C lanceolata soil. The relationships among N dynamics, soil chemistry and microbial properties were analysed. The results suggested tree species induced differences in soil N mineralization rates and mineral N pools were related to labile C availability, soil C:N ratio and the composition of the microbial community. Our data of mineral N pools and soil delta N-15 implied that the transition of land use from C. lanceolata to M. laosensis leads to an enhanced N retention in the plantation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Methane emissions from wetlands and their relationship with vascular plants: an Arctic example
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between vascular plant production and CH4 emissions from an arctic wet tundra ecosystem in north-east Greenland. Light intensity was manipulated by shading during three consecutive growing seasons (1998-2000). The shading treatment resulted in lower carbon cycling in the ecosystem as mean seasonal net ecosystem exchange (NEE) decreased from 336 to -196 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and from -476 to -212 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 1999 and 2000, respectively, and total ecosystem respiration decreased from 125 to 94 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 1999 and from 409 to 306 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in 2000. Seasonal mean CH4 emissions in controls and shaded plots were, respectively, 6.5 and 4.5 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in 1999 and 8.3 and 6.2 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in 2000. We found that CH4 emission was sensitive to NEE and carbon turnover, and it is reasonable to assume that the correlation was due to a combined effect of vegetative CH4 transport and substrate quality coupled to vascular plant production. Total aboveground biomass was correlated to mean seasonal CH4 emission, but separation into species showed that plant-mediated CH4 transport was highly species dependent. Potential CH4 production peaked at the same depth as maximum root density (5-15 cm) and treatment differences further suggest that substrate quality was negatively affected by decreased NEE in the shaded plots. The concentration of dissolved CH4 decreased in the control plots as the growing season progressed while it was relatively stable in the shaded plots. This suggests that a progressively better developed root system in the controls increased the capacity to transport CH4 from the soil to the atmosphere. In conclusion, vascular plant photosynthetic rate and subsequent allocation of recently fixed carbon to belowground structures seemed to influence both vegetative CH4 transport and substrate quality.

TI  - Aerobic deconstruction of cellulosic biomass by an insect-associated Streptomyces
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Streptomyces are best known for producing antimicrobial secondary metabolites, but they are also recognized for their contributions to biomass utilization. Despite their importance to carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, our understanding of the cellulolytic ability of Streptomyces is currently limited to a few soil-isolates. Here, we demonstrate the biomass-deconstructing capability of Streptomyces sp. SirexAA-E (ActE), an aerobic bacterium associated with the invasive pine-boring woodwasp Sirex noctilio. When grown on plant biomass, ActE secretes a suite of enzymes including endo- and exo-cellulases, CBM33 polysaccharide-monooxygenases, and hemicellulases. Genome-wide transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, and biochemical assays have revealed the key enzymes used to deconstruct crystalline cellulose, other pure polysaccharides, and biomass. The mixture of enzymes obtained from growth on biomass has biomass-degrading activity comparable to a cellulolytic enzyme cocktail from the fungus Trichoderma reesei, and thus provides a compelling example of high cellulolytic capacity in an aerobic bacterium.

TI  - Influence of biochar-based urea substituting urea on rice yield, bacterial commnity and nitrogen cycling in paddy fields
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE
AB  - BACKGROUNDThere is an increasing understanding of the importance of biochar-based fertilizers in agroecosystems. However, no research has evaluated the effects of partial substitution of urea with biochar-based urea on rice yields and soil microbial communities. We therefore investigated the rice yields, bacterial communities, and gene abundance involved in nitrogen in silty clay and sandy loam soil paddy fields treated with urea (U), total substitution of urea with biochar-based urea (BSU), partial substitution of urea with biochar-based urea in basal and tillering fertilizers (BSU1), and partial substitution of urea with biochar-based urea in panicle fertilizers (BSU2). RESULTSCompared with U, applying biochar-based urea increased rice yields, with BSU2 having the most notable effect. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that bacterial communities treated with BSU2 in both soils were significantly different from those treated with U and BSU, most probably due to the decrease in pH caused by the decrease in the concentration of ammonium. The relative abundance of Subdivision3_genera_incertae_sedis, Azotobacter, Geobacter, Buchnera, and Terrimonas in silty clay soils and Saccharibacteria_genera_incertae_sedis and Geobacter in sandy loam soils significantly increased when treated with BSU2 and was positively correlated with rice yields, indicating that the improvements in rice yield were associated with changes in bacterial communities. Based upon amoA/narG related to nitrate accumulation and norB/nosZ related to nitrous oxide emissions, BSU2 enabled a lower risk of nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions in both soils, in comparison with the U and BSU treatments. CONCLUSIONThe BSU2 treatment had a stronger yield-increasing effect than biochar-based urea alone and lowered the risk of nitrogen pollution, which is beneficial to the sustainable development of paddy fields.

TI  - Palmitic acid triggers rhizosphere acidification to facilitate microbial nitrogen fixation: A perspective for phytoremediation of desertification alpine grassland via artificial root exudation mimicking
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Organic acids can enhance inorganic nitrogen transformation in rhizosphere soil, however the specific influence of long-chain organic acids on the community and functional structure of soil microorganisms that control nitrogen cycling is poorly understood. Organic acids have shown potential to increase the resilience of alpine ecosystems against desertification. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a controlled experiment in a microcosm rhizosphere system. Using artificial roots (7.85 cm2 surface area), we amended Qinghai-Tibet Plateau soil with palmitic acid for 45 days at three secretion rates (1/2 x , 1 x , and 2 x the in situ rate of 3.20 mu g C d- 1 cm- 2), corresponding to 12.56, 25.12, and 50.24 mu g C d- 1 root- 1 respectively, with a control group receiving only osmoregulation solution. The results revealed a remarkable 81 % increase in soil NH4+-N concentration at the highest addition rate of palmitic acid. Moreover, both microbial biomass and the abundance of nitrogenfixing genes nifK (12.25 times), nifH (7.63 times), and nifD (27.33 times) increased significantly, alongside a substantial rise in the relative abundance of Azospirillum (12.9-fold). Notably, 82 % of biomarkers in the high-rate palmitic acid treatment were linked to nitrogen fixation. The structural equation model indicated a direct impact of nitrogen fixation on NH4+-N concentration. Our findings suggest that palmitic acid primarily enhances microbial biomass and drives nitrogen fixation processes through its decline to pH, rather than serving as a direct carbon source. Consequently, within the range of our experimental setup, the preferential selection of plant species with a high root exudation rate of palmitic acid can optimize NH4+-N retention in rhizosphere soil, thereby promoting plant growth and facilitating vegetation restoration across the desertification alpine grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Increased microbial growth, biomass, and turnover drive soil organic carbon accumulation at higher plant diversity
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Species-rich plant communities have been shown to be more productive and to exhibit increased long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. Soil microorganisms are central to the conversion of plant organic matter into SOC, yet the relationship between plant diversity, soil microbial growth, turnover as well as carbon use efficiency (CUE) and SOC accumulation is unknown. As heterotrophic soil microbes are primarily carbon limited, it is important to understand how they respond to increased plant-derived carbon inputs at higher plant species richness (PSR). We used the long-term grassland biodiversity experiment in Jena, Germany, to examine how microbial physiology responds to changes in plant diversity and how this affects SOC content. The Jena Experiment considers different numbers of species (1-60), functional groups (1-4) as well as functional identity (small herbs, tall herbs, grasses, and legumes). We found that PSR accelerated microbial growth and turnover and increased microbial biomass and necromass. PSR also accelerated microbial respiration, but this effect was less strong than for microbial growth. In contrast, PSR did not affect microbial CUE or biomass-specific respiration. Structural equation models revealed that PSR had direct positive effects on root biomass, and thereby on microbial growth and microbial biomass carbon. Finally, PSR increased SOC content via its positive influence on microbial biomass carbon. We suggest that PSR favors faster rates of microbial growth and turnover, likely due to greater plant productivity, resulting in higher amounts of microbial biomass and necromass that translate into the observed increase in SOC. We thus identify the microbial mechanism linking species-rich plant communities to a carbon cycle process of importance to Earth's climate system.

TI  - Transplantation of organic surface horizons of boreal soils into warmer regions alters microbiology but not the temperature sensitivity of decomposition
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Changes in soil carbon, the largest terrestrial carbon pool, are critical for the global carbon cycle, atmospheric CO2 levels and climate. Climate warming is predicted to be most pronounced in the northern regions and therefore the large soil carbon pool residing in boreal forests will be subject to larger global warming impact than soil carbon pools in the temperate or the tropical forest. A major uncertainty in current estimates of the terrestrial carbon balance is related to decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). We hypothesized that when soils are exposed to warmer climate the structure of the ground vegetation will change much more rapidly than the dominant tree species. This change will alter the quality and amount of litter input to the soil and induce changes in microbial communities, thus possibly altering the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition. We transferred organic surface soil sections from the northern borders of the boreal forest zone to corresponding forest sites in the southern borders of the boreal forest zone and studied the effects of warmer climate after an adaptation period of 2 years. The results showed that initially ground vegetation and soil microbial community structure and community functions were different in northern and southern forest sites and that 2 years of exposure to warmer climate was long enough to cause changes in these ecological indicators. The rate of SOM decomposition was approximately equally sensitive to temperature irrespective of changes in vegetation or microbial communities in the studied forest sites. However, as temperature sensitivity of the decomposition increases with decreasing temperature regime, the proportional increase in the decomposition rate in northern latitudes could lead to significant carbon losses from the soils.

TI  - Seasonality and moisture regime control soil respiration, enzyme activities, and soil microbial biomass carbon in a semi-arid forest of Delhi, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB  - Soil respiration, soil enzymes, and microbial biomass are important in carbon cycling in the terrestrial ecosystem which is generally limited by environmental factors and soil carbon availability. Hence, we tried to assess the factors affecting the functional aspects of these processes in a semi-arid climate. We monitored soil respiration (surface) using a portable infrared gas analyzer (Q-Box SR1LP Soil Respiration Package, Qubit Systems, Canada) equipped with a soil respiration chamber (Model: G 180). Soil respiration was measured at midday during each season throughout the study period. Soil enzymatic activities and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were analyzed following the standard protocol for a year during peak time in four seasons at 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm depth. Soil respiration shows significant variation with highest in monsoon (3.31 mu mol CO(2)m(-2)s(-1)) and lowest in winter (0.57 mu mol CO(2)m(-2)s(-1)). Similarly, beta-glucosidase, dehydrogenase, and phenol oxidase activity ranged from 11.15 to 212.59 mu g PNP g(-1)DW h(-1), 0.11 to 16.47 mu g TPF g(-1)DW h(-1), and 4102.95 to 10187.55 mu mol ABTS(+)g(-1)DW min(-1), respectively. MBC ranged from 17.08 to 484.5 mu g C g(-1). Besides, soil respiration, soil enzymes (except beta-glucosidase), and MBC were significantly correlated with soil moisture. Seasonality, optimum moisture and temperature played a significant role in determining variations in soil microbiological processes (except beta-glucosidase activity); the carbon cycling in the study area is assisted by enzyme activity; dehydrogenase and phenol oxidase played a significant role in soil respiration; hence, this landscape is sensitive to environmental changes.

TI  - Moderate precipitation reduction enhances nitrogen cycling and soil nitrous oxide emissions in a semi-arid grassland
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The ongoing climate change is predicted to induce more weather extremes such as frequent drought and high-intensity precipitation events, causing more severe drying-rewetting cycles in soil. However, it remains largely unknown how these changes will affect soil nitrogen (N)-cycling microbes and the emissions of potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Utilizing a field precipitation manipulation in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau, we examined how precipitation reduction (ca. -30%) influenced soil N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in field, and in a complementary lab-incubation with simulated drying-rewetting cycles. Results obtained showed that precipitation reduction stimulated plant root turnover and N-cycling processes, enhancing soil N2O and CO2 emissions in field, particularly after each rainfall event. Also, high-resolution isotopic analyses revealed that field soil N2O emissions primarily originated from nitrification process. The incubation experiment further showed that in field soils under precipitation reduction, drying-rewetting stimulated N mineralization and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in favor of genera Nitrosospira and Nitrosovibrio, increasing nitrification and N2O emissions. These findings suggest that moderate precipitation reduction, accompanied with changes in drying-rewetting cycles under future precipitation scenarios, may enhance N cycling processes and soil N2O emissions in semi-arid ecosystems, feeding positively back to the ongoing climate change.

TI  - Insights into the associations of copper and zinc with nitrogen metabolism during manure composting with shrimp shell powder
T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The application of shrimp shell powder (SSP) in manure composting can promote the maturation of compost and reduce the associated environmental risk. This study investigated the response of adding SSP at different levels (CK: 0, L: 5%, M: 10%, and H: 15%) on heavy metal resistance genes (MRGs), nitrogen functional genes, en-zymes, and microorganisms. SSP inhibited nitrification and denitrification via decreasing the abundances of functional genes and key enzymes related to Cu, Zn, and MRGs. The nitrate reductase and nitrous-oxide reductase in the denitrification pathway were lower under H. Phylogenetic trees indicated that Burkholderiales sp. had strong relationships with OTU396 and OTU333, with important roles in the nitrogen cycle and plant growth. Redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling showed the complex response between heavy metal and nitrogen that bio-Cu and bio-Zn had positive significantly relationships with nirK-type and amoA-type bacteria, and amoA-type bacteria might be hotspot of cueO.

TI  - Boreal peatland ecosystems under enhanced UV-B radiation and elevated tropospheric ozone concentration
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY
AB  - Boreal peat-forming wetlands, mires, are globally important sources of methane and sinks for CO2. As peatland vegetation plays a significant role regulating the exchange of these greenhouse gases, we have assessed the responses of the dominant plants and ecosystem functions to increasing tropospheric ozone concentration and enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation in long-term experiments, the results of which are summarized in this review. The dominant sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, and especially the Sphagnum mosses common on peatlands, appear fairly tolerant to the future predicted ozone levels. Similarly, UV-B radiation only caused few alterations in the carbohydrates and pigments of the dominant sedge, Eriophorum russeolum, and had no effects on the dominant moss species of the experimental site, Warnstorfia exannulata. Surprisingly, there were alterations in organic acid concentrations in the peat pore water and peat microbial community composition in both experiments. Elevated ozone caused a transient decrease in ecosystem-level gross photosynthesis and methane (CH4) emission, which shifted to a slight increase later on. Enhanced UV-B decreased dark ecosystem respiration and increased CH4 emission in the course of the six measurement years. The emission of isoprene was increased by both ozone and UV-B during warm weather periods, suggesting interactive effects with temperature. All in all, we suggest that ozone and UV-B have limited effects on the carbon cycle in boreal peatlands, because other environmental factors, such as temperature, water level and photosynthetically active radiation more strongly regulate CO2 and CH4 exchange rates.

TI  - Dominance of Candidatus Scalindua species in anammox community revealed in soils with different duration of rice paddy cultivation in Northeast China
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - The anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria play an important role in the oxygen-limited zone for nitrogen cycling, but their roles in agricultural ecosystems are still poorly understood. In this study, soil samples were taken from the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere and from surface (0-5 cm) and subsurface (20-25 cm) layers with 1, 4, and 9 years of rice cultivation history on the typical albic soil of Northeast China to examine the diversity and distribution of anammox bacteria based on 16S rRNA gene and hydrazine oxidoreductase encoding gene (hzo). By comparing these soil samples, no obvious difference was observed in community composition between the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere or the surface and subsurface layers. Surprisingly, anammox bacterial communities of these rice paddy soils were consisted of mainly Candidatus Scalindua species, which are best known to be dominant in marine and pristine environments. The highest diversity was revealed in the 4-year paddy soil based on clone library analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene and deduced HZO from the corresponding encoding gene showed that most of the obtained clones are grouped together with Candidatus Scalindua sorokinii, Candidatus Scalindua brodae, and Candidatus Scalindua spp. of seawater. The obtained clone sequences from all samples are distributed in two subclusters that contain sequences from environmental samples only. Tentative new species were also discovered in this paddy soil. This study provides the first evidence on the existence of anammox bacteria with limited diversity in agricultural ecosystems in Northern China.

TI  - How Biochar Addition Affects Denitrification and the Microbial Electron Transport System (ETSA): A Meta-Analysis Based on a Global Scale
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Biochar has a significant effect on denitrification, especially in agriculture. The effects of biochar and soil properties on denitrification and ETSA have been invested in individual studies but have not yet been summarized on a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis of the data from 37 studies to examine the effects of biochar properties, soil physicochemical properties, and ecosystem types on denitrification. Biochar can decrease soil NO3- and N2O emissions by 14.16% and 76.69%, respectively, while denitrification function genes nirK, nirS, and nosZ increased by 10.98%, 34.62%, and 13.19%, respectively. Biochar enhanced ETSA by 8.65%. The results indicate that the effects of biochar on nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas emissions vary significantly with specific properties, such as feedstock source and pyrolysis temperature, as well as soil characteristics like pH, organic matter, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). In summary, soil-specific biochar applications are necessary to realize optimized agricultural and environmental advantages of biochar, but several limitations have been recognized in this study, including variability across different types of biochar and a lack of longer-term experimental data. Future research should focus on long-term studies that can give a comprehensive understanding of how biochar interacts with microbial communities to create an accurate understanding.

TI  - Effect of phosphate rock, lime and cellulose on soil microbial biomass in acidic forest soil and its significance in carbon cycling
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB  - Phosphate rock (PR), limestone, coal combustion by-product (CCBP) high in Ca and high organic manures are potential amendments for increasing agricultural production in the acidic soils of the Appalachian region. The objective of this study was to examine effects of PR, CCBP and cellulose addition on soil microbial biomass in an acidic soil based on the measurement of soil microbial biomass P (P-mic) and on the mineralization of organic matter. Application of PR alone or in combination with CCBP increased P-mic. The P-mic was far less when the soil received PR in combination with limestone than with PR application alone or PR in combination with CCBP. Either CCBP or limestone application alone considerably decreased P-mic in the soil due to reduced P solubility. Cellulose addition alone did not increase P-mic, but P-mic was significantly increased when the soil was amended with cellulose in combination with PR. The decomposition of added cellulose was very slow in the soil without PR amendment. However, mineralization of both native organic matter and added cellulose was enhanced by PR application. Mineralization of organic matter was less when the soil was amended with PR in combination with high rates of CCBP (> 2.5%) because PR dissolution varied inversely with amount of CCBP addition. Overall, CCBP had no detrimental effect on soil microbial biomass at low application rates, although, like limestone, CCBP at a high rate may decrease P-mic in P-deficient soils through its influence on increased soil pH and decreased P bioavailability in the soil. Application of PR to an acidic soil considerably enhanced the microbial activity, thereby promoting the cycling of carbon and other nutrients.

TI  - Automated robotic assay of phosphomonoesterase activity in soils
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
AB  - Phosphorus cycling in most ecosystems is dependent on plant and microbiologically derived phosphatase enzymes, and available P limits both microbial and plant growth. Measurements of enzymes in soil systems are often time-consuming and labor intensive. In this study, we examined phosphomonoesterase activity in soils using a Zymark XP laboratory robotic system for soil handling, solvent addition and exchange, filtration, incubation, reagent addition, and final sample preparation. Phosphomonoesterase activity was measured using phenyl phosphate as substrate, and samples were analyzed using a 96-well microplate reader. Results indicated that our robotic system was capable of effectively measuring phosphomonoesterase activity in soils differing in physical and chemical characteristics. The results obtained using manual and robotic procedures were comparable in accuracy and precision. The robotic system decreased labor associated with this assay by about a factor of 4.5 relative to the manual system, with considerable savings on reagent costs and labor.

TI  - In-Situ CO2 Partitioning Measurements in a Phragmites australis Wetland: Understanding Carbon Loss through Ecosystem Respiration
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - Common reed (Phragmites australis) is dominant vegetation of temperate coastal wetlands in northeast China. To studying the link between ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and its influential factors, a multi-year in-situ experiment was carried out in a newly restored wetland during the growing seasons of 2012 to 2014. Total in-situ R-eco was separated into soil microbial and belowground root respiration (Rs + r) and plant respiration (R-plant). The soil microbial respiration rate (R-s) was isolated from Rs + r, making it easier to understand each component of R-eco. With the wetland restoration process, the seasonal average aboveground biomass (dry mass) increased from 411.5 g m(-2) to 2048.1 g m(-2) and the corresponding R-eco increased from 751.78 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) to 2612.41 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1).R-plant contributed averagely 69% similar to 71% to R-eco on the whole seasonal scale and the plant activity was strongly seasonal. With 1 g of aboveground common reed biomass (dry weight), approximately 3.6 mg CO2 would be produced per hour during the sprouting period while it could be as low as 0.3 mg CO2 during plant senescence period. Inundation regime dominated the contribution of R-s to R-eco and the flooded contribution would lower the R-s contribution to as low as 11%.

TI  - RNA extraction from decaying wood for (meta) transcriptomic analyses
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Wood decomposition is a key step of the terrestrial carbon cycle and is of economic importance. It is essentially a microbiological process performed by fungi and to an unknown extent by bacteria. To gain access to the genes expressed by the diverse microbial communities participating in wood decay, we developed an RNA extraction protocol from this recalcitrant material rich in polysaccharides and phenolic compounds. This protocol was implemented on 22 wood samples representing as many tree species from 11 plant families in the Angiosperms and Gymnosperms. RNA was successfully extracted from all samples and converted into cDNAs from which were amplified both fungal and bacterial protein coding genes, including genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes participating in lignocellulose hydrolysis. This protocol applicable to a wide range of decomposing wood types represents a first step towards a metatranscriptomic analysis of wood degradation under natural conditions.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi alleviate erosional soil nitrogen loss by regulating nitrogen cycling genes and enzymes in experimental agro-ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Nutrient losses from agricultural ecosystems are increasingly threatening global environmental and human health. Although arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have the potential to regulate soil nitrogen (N) loss by enhancing plant uptake and soil particle immobilization, the microbial mechanism behind such mycorrhizal effect is unknown. Herein, by conducting a simulated erosion experiment, we compared the effects of exogenous AM fungal inoculation (Funneliformis mosseae) on the gene abundances and enzyme activities of N-cycling processes, and associated such effect to N uptake and loss. The experiment was composed of combinations of two AM fungal treatments (control vs. AM fungal inoculation), two crops (maize vs. soybean) and two slopes of the plots (6 degrees vs. 20 degrees). The experimental plots subjected to natural rainfalls to simulate the erosion events. We showed that the effects of AM fungi were greater in the maize soils than in the soybean soils. In the maize soils, AM fungi increased the abundances of N-fixing (+81.1 %) and nitrifying genes (+200.7 %) and N cycling enzyme activity (+22.3 %). In the soybean soils, AM fungi increased the N-fixing gene abundance (+36.9 %) but decreased the abundance of nitrifying genes (18.9 %). The abundance of N-fixing gene was positively correlated with N uptake but negatively correlated with N loss. Additionally, AM fungi enhanced the effects of mycorrhizal colonization and moisture but decreased the effects of nutrients on soil microbial metrics related to N-cycling processes. Therefore, AM fungal inoculation enhanced N uptake and reduced N loss by increasing N-fixing gene abundance, and that AM fungi should be preferably used for the low N environments or for the ecosystems highly limited by or competing for N.

TI  - Long-term metal pollution shifts microbial functional profiles of nitrification and denitrification in agricultural soils
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The increasing contamination of heavy metals in agricultural soils and its impact on the nitrogen (N) cycle and N use efficiency have attracted considerable attention in recent years. In this study, agricultural soils neighboring the Dabaoshan copper mining area (DBS) and Qingyuan electronic-waste recycling area (QY), in Guangdong, China, were sampled to study the interaction between heavy metals and nitrification/denitrification processes, especially the related microbial functional profiles. Results showed that the contamination of heavy metals affected nitrifiers and denitrifiers differently. The potential nitrification activity was about four times lower in metal-polluted soils compared with the unpolluted ones, with a significant decrease in the abundance of amoA and nxrB (p < 0.05) in the polluted samples. On the other hand, the potential denitrification activity was more metal-resistant, which attributed to its complex species composition as shown by a slightly higher a-diversity index, and was slightly higher (p > 0.05) in the polluted samples. Among the five denitrifying genes tested, nosZ gene had the highest increase and the nirK gene the most decrease in numbers and in the polluted soils. The metal-polluted soils had fewer correlations among N functional genes based on the co-occurrence network analysis. In addition, the core taxa of the whole bacterial community changed from copiotrophic to oligotrophic bacteria in the presence of heavy metals. Mantel test indicated that heavy metals were the dominant factors determining N-related genes while the bacterial community composition was due to a combination of heavy metal presence and soil properties such as TOC, NO2- and pH. It is concluded that long-term heavy metals pollution potentially affected nitrificrs and denitrifiers differently as indicated by the shift in N functional genes and the change in nitrification/denitrification processes.

TI  - Nitrogen cycling in tropical and temperate savannas
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
CP  - Workshop on Inter American Nitrogen Network
AB  - Savannas are the most common vegetation type in the tropics and subtropics, ranging in physiognomy from grasslands with scattered woody plants to woodlands with heterogeneous grass cover. Productivity and organic matter turnover in savannas are controlled by interactions between water and nutrient availability, and this basic environmental structure is modified by fire frequency and land management practices. We compared temperate and tropical savannas in order to understand the strength of nitrogen (N) limitation of productivity. American tropical and temperate savannas are N limited systems, and the N cycle differs according to the woody plant density, fire frequency, land use change, N deposition and N fixation. Grazing and conversion to pasture have been the predominant land-use changes in most savannas. In the Cerrado and the Llanos tropical savannas, intensified use of fire for pasture management is leading to decreased woody plant density. Oppositely, in the Chaco and North American temperate savannas,. re suppression and grazing are leading to increases in woody density. In addition, the higher soil P availability in the Gran Chaco and the higher N deposition in North American savannas may be contributing to increases of N cycling and net productivity rates. Some aspects of the N budget for savannas of the American continent are still unclear and require further analysis to determine rates of N fixation, and to understand how spatial and temporal soil heterogeneity control N fluxes through soil solution and into streams.

TI  - Metagenomics insights into the functional profiles of soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles in a walnut orchard under various regimes of long-term fertilisation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
AB  - Soil microbial functional potential is important for productivity and sustainable agricultural development; however, the potential response of soil nutrient cycling to different fertilisation regimes remains unclear, especially in perennial tree soils. Here, metagenomic sequencing was applied to investigate the soil microbial functional profiles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycling after seven years of chemical, organic, and biofertiliser fertilisation in walnut (Juglans regia L.) orchard. Microbial communities balanced their elemental requirements through selective degradation. The highest relative abundance of genes for labile Cdegradation (amyA, malZ, and xylH) was found under chemical fertilisation (F), whereas the metabolic potential for soil N and P cycling was less affected by F. Compared with CK and F, the addition of organic and/or biofertiliser significantly reduced the relative abundances of labile and recalcitrant C-degradation genes (e.g., chi, and xylH) but promoted the processes of N degradation (GDH1, GDH2, ureA, glnA, and arcC), DNRA (nrfA, napB, and napC), organic P mineralisation (phy), P solubilisation (gcd), and P uptake and transport (phnD) in walnut soils. At the phylum level, most C, N, and P cycle-related microbes were similar, and applying biofertiliser remarkably improved the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes involved in C, N, and P cycling processes. Furthermore, soil TN and AP were key limiting macronutrients for regulating the pathways of soil C, N, and P cycles and microbial taxa. C, N, and P cycle-related genes were tightly coupled through synergetic or antagonistic interactions, especially metabolic pathways encoded by glnA, mmsA, phy, and appA. Overall, our results provide a biological perspective on the microbial genetic potential of soil C, N, and P cycles in perennial crops and explore their interactions under different long-term fertilisation regimes in a walnut orchard.

T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling are key ecosystem functions potentially altered by heavy metal pollution. We used an ecosystem approach to study the long-term effect of lead (Pb) on C and N cycles in a natural grassland in a former shooting range. Methods Microbial activity was evaluated by substrate-induced respiration (SIR) in situ, adding isotopically labelled C-4-sugar to the soil. C and N contents and natural abundance of isotopes were measured in grass leaves, soil and microbial biomass together with root biomass. Results A reduced microbial activity and microbial biomass per area, together with a higher soil C stock and C:N ratio suggested a lower microbial decomposition in high Pb compared to low Pb areas. A more closed N cycle in the high Pb area was indicated by 2-3 parts per thousand lower delta N-15 in leaves and soil compared to low Pb areas. Higher delta C-13 in leaves and higher root biomass but similar leaf nutrient contents indicated plant responses and adaptions to the high Pb. Conclusions The applied ecosystem approach revealed that Pb slowed down the C and N cycles, possibly by indirect effects rather than by direct toxicity. The ecosystem seems to have adapted to altered conditions.

TI  - Volatile organic compounds from leaf litter decomposition alter soil microbial communities and carbon dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Investigations into the transfer of carbon from plant litter to underlying soil horizons have primarily focused on the leaching of soluble carbon from litter belowground or the mixing of litter directly into soil. However, previous work has largely ignored the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released during litter decomposition. Unlike most leaf carbon, these litter-derived VOCs are able to diffuse directly into the soil matrix. Here, we used a 99-d microcosm experiment to track VOCs produced during microbial decomposition of(13)C-labeled leaf litter into soil carbon fractions where the decomposing litters were only sharing headspace with the soil samples, thus preventing direct contact and aqueous movement of litter carbon. We also determined the effects of these litter-derived VOCs on soil microbial community structure. We demonstrated that the litter VOCs contributed to all measured soil carbon pools. Specifically, VOC-derived carbon accounted for 2.0, 0.61, 0.18, and 0.08% of carbon in the microbial biomass, dissolved organic matter, mineral-associated organic matter, and particulate organic matter pools, respectively. We also show that litter-derived VOCs can affect soil bacterial and fungal community diversity and composition. These findings highlight the importance of an underappreciated pathway where VOCs alter soil microbial communities and carbon dynamics.

TI  - The role of microarthropods in emerging models of soil organic matter
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - A new understanding of soil organic matter (SOM) formation and stabilization has emerged over the past decade, highlighting the importance of microbial activity, mineral association of organic matter and aggregate occlusion of organic matter to SOM persistence. To date, the contribution of microarthropods to litter decomposition and SOM formation processes has not received due consideration and theoretical and empirical models should be modified to include how these organisms impact SOM protection. Here, we highlight the biological, chemical and physical mechanisms by which microarthropods influence SOM formation both directly and indirectly. Although more data is needed to quantify the impacts of different microarthropods on SOM dynamics, we highlight areas where inclusion of microarthropods in emerging models of SOM formation could reduce model uncertainties.

TI  - Effects of substrate availability on the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil carbon is a major component in the global carbon cycle. Understanding the relationship between environmental changes and rates of soil respiration is critical for projecting changes in soil carbon fluxes in a changing climate. Although significant attention has been focused on the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition, the factors that affect this temperature sensitivity are still debated. In this study, we examined the effects of substrate availability on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration in several different kinds of soils. We found that increased substrate availability had a significant positive effect on temperature sensitivity, as measured by soil Q(10) values, and that this effect was inversely proportional to original substrate availability. This observation can be explained if decomposition follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The simple Q(10) model was most appropriate in soils with high substrate availability.

TI  - Crop rotational complexity affects plant-soil nitrogen cycling during water deficit
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - One of the biggest environmental challenges facing agriculture is how to both supply and retain nitrogen (N), especially as precipitation becomes more variable with climate change. We used a greenhouse experiment to assess how contrasting histories of crop rotational complexity affect plant-soil-microbe interactions that govern N processes, including during water stress. With higher levels of carbon and N cycling hydrolytic enzymes, higher mineral-associated organic matter N concentrations, and an altered microbial community, soils from the most complex rotation enabled 80% more corn N uptake under two moisture regimes, compared to soil from monoculture corn. Higher levels of plant N likely drove the changes in corn leaf gas exchange, particularly increasing intrinsic water use efficiency by 9% in the most complex rotation. The water deficit increased the standing pool of nitrate 44-fold in soils with a history of complex crop rotations, compared to an 11-fold increase in soils from the corn monoculture. The implications of this difference must be considered in a whole cropping systems and field context. Cycling of N-15-labeled fresh clover residue into soil N pools did not depend on the water regime or rotation history, with 2-fold higher recovery in the mineral vs. particulate organic N pool. In contrast, the water deficit reduced recovery of clover 15 N in corn shoots by 37%, showing greater impacts of water deficit on plant N uptake compared to organic N cycling in soil. This study provides direct experimental evidence that long-term crop rotational complexity influences microbial N cycling and availability with feedbacks to plant physiology. Collectively, these results could help explain general observations of higher yields in more complex crop rotations, including specifically during dry conditions.

AB  - Exotic plant invasions alter ecosystem structure and function above- and below-ground through plant-soil feedbacks. The resistance of ecosystems to invasion can be measured by the degree of change in microbial communities and soil chemical pools and fluxes, whereas their resilience can be measured by the ability to recover following restoration. Coastal sage scrub (CSS) is one of the most highly invaded ecosystems in the US but the response of CSS soils to exotic plant invasion is little known. We examined resistance and resilience of CSS soil chemical and biological characteristics following invasion of exotic annual grasses and forbs and restoration of the native plant community. We hypothesized that invasion of exotic plant species would change biological and chemical characteristics of CSS soils by altering soil nutrient inputs. Additionally, we expected that if exotic plants were controlled and native plants were restored, native soil characteristics would recover. We sampled two locations with invaded, restored and native CSS for plant community composition, soil chemistry and microbial communities, and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles. Communities invaded by exotic annuals were resistant to some measured parameters but not others. Extractable nitrogen pools decreased, nitrogen cycling rates increased, and microbial biomass and fungal:bacterial ratios were altered in invaded soils, and these effects were mediated by the phenological stage of the dominant plant species. The largest impact of invasion on soils was an overall reduction of spatial heterogeneity in soil nutrients, nutrient cycling and microbial communities. Restored plots tended to recover in most biotic and chemical parameters including increased resource heterogeneity compared to invaded plots, suggesting that CSS soils are resilient but not resistant to invasion.

TI  - Effect of different fertilization regimes on the vertical distribution of anaerobic ammonium oxidation in paddy soils
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Fertilization is a necessary practice for paddy fields to achieve high crop yields, and this practice could have an important impact on soil nitrogen cycle. Anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) is an important process in the nitrogen cycle of paddy ecosystems. However, until now, the influence of nitrogen fertilization on anammox, is not well understood. Here, the vertical distribution of the activity, abundance and community composition of anammox bacteria was investigated in paddy soils (0-50 cm) under three different fertilizer treatments: chemical fertilizer (CF), organic fertilizer (OF) and unfertilized control (CK). The N-15 tracer experiments confirmed anammox activity in different depths of paddy soils across all treatments, with the highest activity in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm) under OF treatment. The potential anammox rates were 0.76-1.82, 0.95-2.39 and 1.19-3.62 nmol N g(-1) (dry soil) h(-1), respectively, under CK, CF and OF treatments. The abundance of anammox bacterial hzsA genes in upper 30 cm layers was significantly higher under CF (3.1 x 10(6)-6.5 x 10(6) copies g(-1) dry soil) and OF (3.4 x 10(6)-7.1 x 10(6) copies g(-1) dry soil) treatments than CK treatment (2.1 x 10(6)-3.5 x 10(6) copies g(-1) dry soil). Similar community composition of anammox bacteria was observed in soils under different fertilizer treatments, with Candidates Brocadia being the single dominant genus. Overall, our results demonstrated that the input of inorganic or organic fertilizers significantly increased the anammox bacterial abundance and activity in both surface and subsurface paddy soils, while the anammox community remained relatively stable.

TI  - Plant species identity surpasses species richness as a key driver of N2O emissions from grassland
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Grassland ecosystems worldwide not only provide many important ecosystem services but they also function as a major source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), especially in response to nitrogen deposition by grazing animals. To explore the role of plants as mediators of these emissions, we tested whether and how N2O emissions are dependent on grass species richness and/or specific grass species composition in the absence and presence of urine deposition. We hypothesized that: (i) N2O emissions relate negatively to plant productivity; (ii) four-species mixtures have lower emissions than monocultures (as they are expected to be more productive); (iii) emissions are lowest in combinations of species with diverging root morphology and high root biomass; and (iv) the identity of the key species that reduce N2O emissions is dependent on urine deposition. We established monocultures and two- and four-species mixtures of common grass species with diverging functional traits: Lolium perenne L. (Lp), Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (Fa), Phleum pratense L. (Php) and Poa trivialis L. (Pt), and quantified N2O emissions for 42days. We found no relation between plant species richness and N2O emissions. However, N2O emissions were significantly reduced in specific plant species combinations. In the absence of urine, plant communities of Fa+Php acted as a sink for N2O, whereas the monocultures of these species constituted a N2O source. With urine application Lp+Pt plant communities reduced (P<0.001) N2O emissions by 44% compared to monocultures of Lp. Reductions in N2O emissions by species mixtures could be explained by total biomass productivity and by complementarity in root morphology. This study shows that plant species composition is a key component underlying N2O emissions from grassland ecosystems. Selection of specific grass species combinations in the context of the expected nitrogen deposition regimes may therefore provide a key for mitigation of N2O emissions.

TI  - Temporal variation of diazotrophic community abundance and structure in surface and subsoil under four fertilization regimes during a wheat growing season
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is an initial process of the nitrogen cycle (Cleveland et al., 1999) by the specialized microorganisms known as diazotroph. However, little information is available concerning the dynamic changes of diazotrophic communities in surface and subsoil layers. In this study, five representative season soil samples were collected from surface (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-40 cm) in the long term experimental field plots that received no nitrogen fertilizer (CK), chemical fertilizers (CF), organic-inorganic mixed fertilizer (OIMF) and organic fertilizer (OF) since 2005. Real-time PCR was used to determine the nifH and total bacterial 16S rRNA gene abundance. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of nifH gene was used to analyze the changes of diazotrophic communities. Results revealed that the abundance of nifH and 16S rRNA genes declined with increased soil depth regardless of fertilization regimes, although considerably high abundance was also observed in subsoils. The abundance of nifH genes was significantly positively correlated with the total bacterial abundance in oligotrophic subsoil layers, but not in the topsoil. Ammonium contents showed significant correlation to the nifH gene abundance in both surface and subsoil. Clustering analysis of the T-RFLP profiles showed that diazotrophic structures were clearly separated by surface and subsoil habitats. Permutational multivariate analyses demonstrated that soil depth, rather than the sampling time or fertilization regime, was the important factor that influence the diazotrophic structures. In the surface soil, soil organic carbon (SOC) and ammonium contents were significantly positively correlated to the diazotrophic community structures. These results suggest soil physiochemical properties selected for distinct diazotrophic communities inhabit in the topsoil and subsoil. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Influence of Recycled Waste Compost on Soil Food Webs, Nutrient Cycling and Tree Growth in a Young Almond Orchard
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Composting is an effective strategy to process agricultural and urban waste into forms that may be beneficial to crops. The objectives of this orchard field study were to characterize how a dairy manure compost and a food waste compost influenced: (1) soil nitrogen and carbon pools, (2) bacterial and nematode soil food webs and (3) tree growth and leaf N. The effects of composts were compared with fertilized and unfertilized control plots over two years in a newly planted almond orchard. Both dairy manure compost and food waste compost increased soil organic matter pools, as well as soil nitrate and ammonium at certain time points. Both composts also distinctly altered bacterial communities after application, specifically those groups with carbon degrading potential, and increased populations of bacterial feeding nematodes, although in different timeframes. Unique correlations were observed between nematode and bacterial groups within compost treatments that were not present in controls. Food waste compost increased trunk diameters compared to controls and had greater relative abundance of herbivorous root tip feeding nematodes. Results suggest that recycled waste composts contribute to biologically based nitrogen cycling and can increase tree growth, mainly within the first year after application.

TI  - Effects of planting year of alfalfa on rhizosphere bacterial structure and function
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
AB  - In many areas across the world, alfalfa is still cultivated in the same place over many years, leading to gradually deplete the soil nutrients and increase plant disease and consequent decreases in the yield and quality. Agricultural management practices have been proved to affect largely soil microbial community structure and functions in many reports, but it remains unclear how planting year effects extend to the rhizosphere under a long-term cultivation practices of alfalfa. Exploring such impacts is of great importance to understand and develop plant-microorganism interactions for agricultural sustainability. A long-term field experiment was set up at Linze research station of Lanzhou University in Gansu province, where alfalfa was continuously planted for four years (Y4) and six years (Y6). Rhizosphere soils from two different planting years were collected to examine differences in the bacterial diversity, composition and co-occurrence patterns using 16S rRNA gene sequencing technologies as well as in functional profiles involved in nitrogen cycling predicted by FAPROTAX. We found that soil nutrients including soil organic carbon (SOC), AP (available phosphorus) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3 -N) differed significantly between planting years. Bacterial taxonomic diversity, composition and the relative abundance of functional groups involved in nitrogen cycling were significantly affected by planting years, sampling time and their interactions. Co-occurrence network analysis showed that keystone taxa in both planting years were affiliated to Proteobacteria and bacteria taxa had less complexity and more negative correlations in Y6 than in Y4. NO3 -N was a major factor affecting bacterial community diversity and composition across planting years. Together, our findings suggest that planting years of alfalfa can lead to large variations in soil nutrients and rhizosphere microbial community patterns. These results implies that in agricultural management practices, planting year effects can even extend to microorganisms in association with plant roots, which may affect crop growth given close linkages between rhizosphere processes and plant nutrition availability.

TI  - The Transcriptional Response of Soil Bacteria to Long-Term Warming and Short-Term Seasonal Fluctuations in a Terrestrial Forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems are an important carbon store, and this carbon is vulnerable to microbial degradation with climate warming. After 30 years of experimental warming, carbon stocks in a temperate mixed deciduous forest were observed to be reduced by 30% in the heated plots relative to the controls. In addition, soil respiration was seasonal, as was the warming treatment effect. We therefore hypothesized that long-term warming will have higher expressions of genes related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism due to increased utilization of recalcitrant carbon pools compared to controls. Because of the seasonal effect of soil respiration and the warming treatment, we further hypothesized that these patterns will be seasonal. We used RNA sequencing to show how the microbial community responds to long-term warming (similar to 30 years) in Harvard Forest, MA. Total RNA was extracted from mineral and organic soil types from two treatment plots (+5 degrees C heated and ambient control), at two time points (June and October) and sequenced using Illumina NextSeq technology. Treatment had a larger effect size on KEGG annotated transcripts than on CAZymes, while soil types more strongly affected CAZymes than KEGG annotated transcripts, though effect sizes overall were small. Although, warming showed a small effect on overall CAZymes expression, several carbohydrate-associated enzymes showed increased expression in heated soils (similar to 68% of all differentially expressed transcripts). Further, exploratory analysis using an unconstrained method showed increased abundances of enzymes related to polysaccharide and lipid metabolism and decomposition in heated soils. Compared to long-term warming, we detected a relatively small effect of seasonal variation on community gene expression. Together, these results indicate that the higher carbohydrate degrading potential of bacteria in heated plots can possibly accelerate a self-reinforcing carbon cycle-temperature feedback in a warming climate.

TI  - Nitrogen inputs accelerate phosphorus cycling rates across a wide variety of terrestrial ecosystems
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Biologically essential elements especially nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) constrain plant growth and microbial functioning; however, human activities are drastically altering the magnitude and pattern of such nutrient limitations on land. Here we examine interactions between N and P cycles of P mineralizing enzyme activities (phosphatase enzymes) across a wide variety of terrestrial biomes. We synthesized results from 34 separate studies and used meta-analysis to evaluate phosphatase activity with N, P, or NxP fertilization. Our results show that N fertilization enhances phosphatase activity, from the tropics to the extra-tropics, both on plant roots and in bulk soils. By contrast, P fertilization strongly suppresses rates of phosphatase activity. These results imply that phosphatase enzymes are strongly responsive to changes in local nutrient cycle conditions. We also show that plant phosphatases respond more strongly to fertilization than soil phosphatases. The tight coupling between N and P provides a mechanism for recent observations of N and P co-limitation on land. Moreover, our results suggest that terrestrial plants and microbes can allocate excess N to phosphatase enzymes, thus delaying the onset of single P limitation to plant productivity as can occur via human modifications to the global N cycle.

TI  - Chitin degradation and the temporary response of bacterial chitinolytic communities to chitin amendment in soil under different fertilization regimes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Chitin amendment is a promising agricultural management strategy to control fungal and nematodal plant diseases and to improve crop yield. Chitin degradation in the soil contributes significantly to carbon and nitrogen cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known about chitin degradation and bacterial chitinolytic communities in agricultural soil under different fertilization regimes. Thus, in the present study, a 42-day soil incubation experiment was conducted, in which soil under four fertilization regimes (i.e., no fertilization (CK), chemical fertilizer (CF), pig manure plus 50% chemical fertilizer (PMCF), and rice straw plus 100% chemical fertilizer (SRCF)) were amended or not with chitin or its monomer, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). Different nitrogen forms and CO2 and N2O emission were measured to evaluate chitin degradation and its environmental implications. SRCF soil had the highest CO2 emission, chitin N mineralization, and fungal abundance. NAG and chitin were enriched to exploit the chitin degraders. High-throughput sequencing analyses reveled that Streptomycetaceae, Oxalobacteraceae, Gemmatimonadaceae, and Acidobacteria were generally increased upon chitin amendment in CK, CF, and PMCF soil, whereas Streptomycetaceae dominated chitin-amended SRCF soil. Herpetosiphonaceae was enriched only in chitin-amended CK soil. LEfSe and network analysis were used to predict chitinolytic and opportunistic species, and revealed that most previously reported chitinolytic bacteria were detected in the present study and new potential chitin degraders, including unidentified_Solibacterales, Gemmatimonadaceae, and Herpetosiphonaceae, were identified. Some members of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, including Bacillus, and Kitasatospora, were speculated to be opportunistic species. The findings improve our understanding of the effects of chitin degradation on carbon and nitrogen cycling in agricultural soil under different fertilization regimes and help to identify chitinolytic bacteria.

TI  - Effects of anthropogenic nitrogen additions and elevated CO2 on microbial community, carbon and nitrogen content in a replicated wetland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - Anthropogenic deposition of nitrogen (N) and elevated CO2 (eaCO2) are expected to increase continuously and rapidly in the near future and influence global carbon cycling. These parameters affect the ecosystem by regulating the microbial community and contribute to soil organic matter decomposition. The study was performed to understand the effects of N additions (4 and 6mgl(-1)) and eaCO2 (700 ppm) on carbon (C)/nitrogen (N) content in the soil, microbial community, and plant biomass (Alternanthera philoxeroides species). The results showed that when the atmospheric CO2 concentration was raised, the total organic carbon (TOC) in the soil statistically increased (P < 0.05) by 4% and 3% under low and high N additions respectively, while the inorganic carbon content also increased by 1% and 3% (P > 0.05) under the same conditions. The increase in the soil TOC content was a result of the movement of carbon from water to the soil due to the presence of vascular tissues of plants in the water. The redundancy analysis (RDA) results revealed that the presence of plant species was responsible for the carbon content increment in the soil. The plant biomass content increased by 30.96% (P = 0.081) and 31.36%, (P = 0.002) under low and high N addition respectively due to the increment in atmospheric CO2. The nitrogen content in the plant species decreased (p > 0.05) by 8.62% and 6.25% at low and high N addition respectively when atmospheric CO2 was raised. This suggests that soil microbes competed with the plants for inorganic nitrogen in the soil and the microbes used up the inorganic nitrogen before it got to the plants. The gram-positive bacteria and fungi population decreased under high N addition and eaCO2 while gram-negative bacteria increased, suggesting that N additions and eaCO2 affected the microbial function and correlated with the nitrogen reduction in the soil. The results from this study serve as a guide to researchers and stakeholders in making policies with regard to the constant increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

TI  - Stalagmite carbon isotopes suggest deglacial increase in soil respiration in western Europe driven by temperature change
T2  - CLIMATE OF THE PAST
AB  - The temperate region of western Europe underwent significant climatic and environmental change during the last deglaciation. Much of what is known about the terrestrial ecosystem response to deglacial warming stems from pollen preserved in sediment sequences, providing information on vegetation composition. Other ecosystem processes, such as soil respiration, remain poorly constrained over past climatic transitions but are critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and its response to ongoing anthropogenic warming. Here we show that speleothem carbon isotope (delta C-13(spel)) records may retain information on soil respiration and allow its reconstruction over time. While this notion has been proposed in the past, our study is the first to rigorously test it, using a combination of multi-proxy geochemical analysis (delta C-13, Ca isotopes, and radiocarbon) on three speleothems from the NW Iberian Peninsula and quantitative forward modelling of processes in soil, karst, and cave. Our study is the first to quantify and remove the effects of prior calcite precipitation (PCP, using Ca isotopes) and bedrock dissolution (using the radiocarbon reservoir effect) from the delta(13)Cspel signal to derive changes in respired delta C-13. The coupling of soil gas pCO(2) and delta C-13 via a mixing line describing diffusive gas transport between an atmospheric and a respired end-member allows the modelling of changes in soil respiration in response to temperature. Using this coupling and a range of other parameters describing carbonate dissolution and cave atmospheric conditions, we generate large simulation ensembles from which the results most closely matching the measured speleothem data are selected. Our results robustly show that an increase in soil gas pCO(2) (and thus respiration) is needed to explain the observed deglacial trend in delta(13)Cspel. However, the Q(10) (temperature sensitivity) derived from the model results is higher than current measurements, suggesting that part of the signal may be related to a change in the composition of the soil respired delta C-13, likely from changing substrate through increasing contribution from vegetation biomass with the onset of the Holocene.

TI  - Response of Chaetomium sp. to Nitrogen Input and Its Potential Role in Rhizosphere Enrichment of Lycium barbarum
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Lycium barbarum L. (goji berry), a traditional Chinese medicinal plant, depends heavily on nitrogen input to maintain productivity. Nitrogen application also profoundly influences rhizosphere microbial dynamics, which are critical for soil health and plant performance. This study aimed to investigate how the rhizosphere fungal community responds to nitrogen input and explore the potential role of beneficial fungi (e.g., Chaetomium) in goji berry rhizosphere enrichment. A field experiment with four nitrogen levels (0, 53.82, 67.62, and 80.73 g<middle dot>N m-2<middle dot>year-1, designated as N0, N1, N2, and N3) was conducted to analyze the fungal community structure in the rhizosphere of goji berry using ITS rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The results showed that nitrogen input significantly altered the rhizosphere fungal community composition and diversity. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and Mantel tests indicated that soil electrical conductivity, total phosphorus, available phosphorus, and nitrate nitrogen were key environmental factors driving the fungal communities' shifts. Notably, specific fungal genera, including Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Gibberella, Fusarium, Pyxidiophora, Acaulium, and Lophotrichus, exhibited differential enrichment across nitrogen levels. In particular, Chaetomium was significantly enriched under the conventional nitrogen treatment (N2), a strain of Chaetomium sp. LC101 was successfully isolated from the goji berry rhizosphere, and its functional roles were verified via pot experiments. Inoculation with Chaetomium sp. LC101 significantly promoted goji berry growth, with the most pronounced effects observed under N0 treatments, root fresh weight, root vitality, and leaf chlorophyll content increased by up to 55.10%, 15.69%, and 43.27%, respectively, compared to non-inoculated controls. Additionally, Chaetomium sp. LC101 regulated rhizosphere nitrogen transformation by enhancing urease, nitrite reductase, and polyphenol oxidase activities while inhibiting nitrate reductase activity. These findings demonstrate that Chaetomium responds sensitively to nitrogen input, with enrichment under moderate nitrogen levels, and acts as a beneficial rhizosphere fungus by promoting plant growth and regulating nitrogen cycling. This study provides novel insights for nitrogen management in the goji berry industry, where synergistic regulation via "nitrogen reduction combined with microbial inoculation" can reduce nitrogen loss, improve yield and quality through functional fungi, and contribute to ecological sustainability.

TI  - Regulation of soil microorganisms and phosphorus cycling genes on soil phosphorus availability in desert steppe under warming and phosphorus input
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Climate warming can directly or indirectly influence soil phosphorus (P) availability. Soil microorganisms are essential driving forces of P cycling. However, how the soil microbes and P cycling genes respond to variations in soil P availability on climate warming in the P-limited desert steppe is unclear. In this study, we conducted a field experiment using two temperature levels (control, warming) and three P fertilizer addition rates (0, 5, 10 g P m(-2)center dot yr(-1)) in the desert steppe. Microbiological and metagenomic analyses were used to explore the shifts in the relative abundance and compositions of soil microbial and P cycling genes in response to warming and P inputs. The results demonstrated that warming decreased soil labile P (7.04 %) by reducing the percentages of resin-P, NaHCO3-Pi, and HCl-Pi in inorganic P (Pi). P inputs significantly increased soil TP, MBP, Pi, and inorganic P fractions contents, and further enhanced soil labile P (1.27-3.55 times), moderately labile P (7.04-17.59 %), and stable P (4.23-10.47 %). The interaction of warming and P addition increased NaHCO3-Pi, the percentages of NaHCO3-Pi in Pi, and improved soil labile P (1.68-2.05 times) and stable P (5.38-10.38 %). Soil P availability was mainly regulated by TP and MBP, which were positively correlated with the organic P mineralization gene (phnW). Our findings indicated that soil bacteria and fungi did not alter in response to changes in P availability under warming and P input. The phnW gene played an essential role in regulating soil P availability in the desert steppe.

TI  - Microbial community utilization of recalcitrant and simple carbon compounds: impact of oak-woodland plant communities
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Little is known about how the structure of microbial communities impacts carbon cycling or how soil microbial community composition mediates plant effects on C-decomposition processes. We examined the degradation of four C-13-labeled compounds (starch, xylose, vanillin, and pine litter), quantified rates of associated enzyme activities, and identified microbial groups utilizing the C-13-labeled substrates in soils under oaks and in adjacent open grasslands. By quantifying increases in non-C-13-labeled carbon in microbial biomarkers, we were also able to identify functional groups responsible for the metabolism of indigenous soil organic matter. Although microbial community composition differed between oak and grassland soils, the microbial groups responsible for starch, xylose, and vanillin degradation, as defined by C-13-PLFA, did not differ significantly between oak and grassland soils. Microbial groups responsible for pine litter and SOM-C degradation did differ between the two soils. Enhanced degradation of SOM resulting from substrate addition (priming) was greater in grassland soils, particularly in response to pine litter addition; under these conditions, fungal and Gram + biomarkers showed more incorporation of SOM-C than did Gram - biomarkers. In contrast, the oak soil microbial community primarily incorporated C from the added substrates. More C-13 (from both simple and recalcitrant sources) was incorporated into the Gram - biomarkers than Gram + biomarkers despite the fact that the Gram + group generally comprised a greater portion of the bacterial biomass than did markers for the Gram - group. These experiments begin to identify components of the soil microbial community responsible for decomposition of different types of C-substrates. The results demonstrate that the presence of distinctly different plant communities did not alter the microbial community profile responsible for decomposition of relatively labile C-substrates but did alter the profiles of microbial communities responsible for decomposition of the more recalcitrant substrates, pine litter and indigenous soil organic matter.

TI  - Effects of wildfire on soil respiration and its heterotrophic and autotrophic components in a montane coniferous forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Aims Episodic wildfires are expected to occur more frequently under future climate change scenarios, with substantial effects on CO2 exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. This study examined the effects of wildfire on soil respiration (R-S) and its heterotrophic (R-H) and autotrophic (R-A) components, as well as their temperature responses (temperature sensitivity, Q(10)).
   Methods We began this study in January 2014, 8 months after a wildfire, in a montane coniferous forest in southwestern China. A trenching method was used to exclude plant roots and quantify R-H. R-A was calculated by subtracting R-H from R-S.
   Important findings From 2014 to 2015, the wildfire significantly reduced R-S, R-H and R-A by 61.3%, 42.5% and 84.0%, respectively, leading to increases in the ratio of R-H to R-S, from 0.63 in the unburned stand to 0.85 in the burned stand. Ignoring diurnal differences, the wildfire did not affect the Q(10) of R-S or R-H, but substantially decreased the Q(10) of R-A, from 2.62 in the unburned stand to 2.08 in the burned stand. However, the daytime Q(10) of R-S and R-H was suppressed following the wildfire by 25.1% and 28.8%, respectively, primarily due to increased daytime soil temperature. In the montane coniferous forest, monthly precipitation but not soil temperature drove seasonal dynamics of soil CO2 release. Our findings help to clarify the mechanisms underlying carbon cycling responses to natural disturbance, especially under a warmer future climate.

TI  - Effects of Human Trampling on Populations of Soil Fauna in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
AB  - Antarctic ecosystems are often considered nearly pristine because levels of anthropogenic disturbance are extremely low there. Nevertheless, over recent decades there has been a rapid increase in the number of people, researchers and tourists, visiting Antarctica. We evaluated, over 10 years, the direct impact of foot traffic on the abundance of soil animals and soil properties in Taylor Valley within the McMurdo Dry Valleys region of Antarctica. We compared soils from minimally disturbed areas with soils from nearby paths that received intermediate and high levels of human foot traffic (i.e., up to approximately 80 passes per year). The nematodes Scottnema lindsayae and Eudorylaimus sp. were the most commonly found animal species, whereas rotifers and tardigrades were found only occasionally. On the highly trampled footpaths, abundance of S. lindsayae and Eudorylaimus sp. was up to 52 and 76% lower, respectively, than in untrampled areas. Moreover, reduction in S. lindsayae abundance was more pronounced after 10 years than 2 years and in the surface soil than in the deeper soil, presumably because of the longer period of disturbance and the greater level of physical disturbance experienced by the surface soil. The ratio of living to dead Eudorylaimus sp. also declined with increased trampling intensity, which is indicative of increased mortality or reduced fecundity. At one site there was evidence that high levels of trampling reduced soil CO2 fluxes, which is related to total biological activity in the soil. Our results show that even low levels of human traffic can significantly affect soil biota in this ecosystem and may alter ecosystem processes, such as carbon cycling. Consequently, management and conservation plans for Antarctic soils should consider the high sensitivity of soil fauna to physical disturbance as human presence in this ecosystem increases.

TI  - Effects of allylthiourea, salinity, and pH on ammonia/ammonium-oxidizing prokaryotes in mangrove sediment incubated in laboratory microcosms
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria, aerobic ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) are three groups of ammonia/ammonium-oxidizing prokaryotes (AOPs) involved in the biochemical nitrogen cycling. In this study, the effects of allylthiourea (ATU), pH, and salinity on these three groups from mangrove sediment were investigated through microcosm incubation in laboratory. ATU treatments (50, 100, and 500 mg L-1) obviously affected the community structure of anammox bacteria and AOB, but only slightly for AOA. ATU began to inhibit anammox bacteria growth slightly from day 10, but had an obvious inhibition on AOA growth from the starting of the study. At 100 mg L-1 of ATU or higher, AOB growth was inhibited, but only lasted for 5 days. The pH treatments showed that acidic condition (pH 5) had a slight effect on the community structure of anammox bacteria and AOA, but an obvious effect on AOB. Acidic condition promoted the growth of all groups of AOPs in different extent, but alkaline condition (pH 9) had a weak effect on AOB community structure and a strong effect on both anammox bacteria and AOA. Alkaline condition obviously inhibited anammox bacteria growth, slightly promoted AOA, and slightly promoted AOB in the first 20 days, but inhibited afterward. Salinity treatment showed that higher salinity (20 and 40 aEuro degrees) resulted in higher anammox bacteria diversity, and both AOA and AOB might have species specificity to salinity. High salinity promoted the growth of both anammox bacteria and AOB, inhibited AOA between 5 and 10 days, but promoted afterward. The results help to understand the role of these microbial groups in biogeochemical nitrogen cycling and their responses to the changing environments.

TI  - Metagenomics reveals soil nitrogen cycling after vegetation restoration: Influence of different vegetation restoration strategies
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Microorganisms play a crucial role in the cycling and transformation of nitrogen (N) within ecosystems. However, there is limited understanding regarding the impact of vegetation restoration on soil N cycling. A field study investigated the effects of different vegetation restoration strategies on soil microbial N cycling in sandy deserts of northern China including the use of metagenomic sequencing technology. The restoration strategies included the planting of Bromus inermis Leyss (SB), Medicago sativa L. (AF), and combined planting of Salix babylonica L. and Bromus inermis Leyss (FG). Compared with the natural restoration (CK), the abundance of genes related to soil N nitrification and denitrification processes was found to be higher in the AF and SB restoration strategies. On the other hand, the SB strategy specifically led to an enrichment of genes linked to dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Compared with the CK, the abundance of amoC/pmoC, hao and nxrA involved in soil N nitrification were higher in AF. The diversity of the fungal community was more strongly influenced by various vegetation restoration strategies compared to bacteria. Interestingly, FG had no significant effect on bacterial and fungal diversity compared to CK. However, alpha diversity of fungal communities was lower in AF and higher in SB compared to the CK. Soil pH was positively related to functional genes that drive nitrification and denitrification processes ( nirK , amoC/pmoC, and hao ). N fixation and DNRA exhibited a negative correlation with both microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen. Consequently, the planting of AF and SB hold significant importance in promoting soil N cycling within degraded lands. The study offered valuable insights into the microbial functional potentials associated with long-term vegetation restoration efforts, potentially bearing significant implications for soil N cycling in the degraded lands of northern China.

TI  - Resilience and sensitivity of ecosystem carbon stocks to fire-regime change in Alaskan tundra
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Fire disturbance has increased in some tundra ecosystems due to anthropogenic climate change, with important ramifications for terrestrial carbon cycling. Assessment of the potential impact of fire-regime change on tundra carbon stocks requires long-term perspectives because tundra fires have been rare historically. Here we integrated the process-based Dynamic Organic Soil version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model with paleo-fire records to evaluate the responses of tundra carbon stocks to changes in fire return interval (FRI). Paleorecords reveal that mean FRIs of tundra ecosystems in Alaska ranged from centennial to millennial timescales (200-6000 years) during the late Quaternary, but projected FRIs by 2100 decrease to a few hundred years to several decades (70-660 years). Our simulations indicate threshold effects of changing FRIs on tundra carbon stocks. Shortening FRI from 5000 to 1000 years results in minimal carbon release (<5%) from Alaskan tundra ecosystems. Rapid carbon stock loss occurs when FRI declines below 800 years trigger sustained mobilization of ancient carbon stocks from permafrost soils. However, substantial spatial heterogeneity in the resilience/sensitivity of tundra carbon stocks to FRI change exists, largely attributable to vegetation types. We identified the carbon stocks in shrub tundra as the most vulnerable to decreasing FRI because shrub tundra stores a large share of carbon in combustible biomass and organic soils. Moreover, our results suggest that ecosystems characterized by large carbon stocks and relatively long FRIs (e.g. Brooks Foothills) may transition towards hotspots of permafrost carbon emission as a response to crossing FRI thresholds in the coming decades. These findings combined imply that fire disturbance may play an increasingly important role in future carbon balance of tundra ecosystems, but the net outcome may be strongly modulated by vegetation composition.

TI  - Effects of Biochar on Soil Inorganic Phosphorus Components, Available Phosphorus, Enzyme Activities Related to Phosphorus Cycle, Microbial Functional Genes, and Seedling Growth of Populus euphratica under Different Water Conditions
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Cow dung is a kind of high quality and renewable biological resource. Biochar made from cow dung can be used as a soil amendment to improve soil nutrient status. The relationship between soil water and phosphorus is very close, and the water status determines the form, content, and availability of phosphorus. In order to investigate the effects of biochar on soil inorganic phosphorus components, available phosphorus, enzyme activities related to the phosphorus cycle, microbial functional genes, and seedling growth under different soil water conditions were investigated. Field experiments were carried out by setting different water conditions (30%, 60%, and 100%) and biochar addition (0 t hm(-2), 2.63 t hm(-2), 5.26 t hm(-2), and 7.89 t hm(-2)). The results showed that applying biochar significantly increased the soil's accessible phosphorus content and the phosphorus content in both the aboveground and subsurface parts of P. euphratica seedlings. This is mainly attributable to biochar's direct and indirect effects on soil properties. Because biochar is naturally alkaline, it raises soil pH and reduces acid phosphatase activity in the soil around P. euphratica seedlings in the rhizosphere. Perhaps the alkaline phosphatase level first showed an upward trend due to the combined impacts of water and biochar, and then it started to decline when the biochar addition was increased. Soil phosphorus functional genes phoC, phoD, gcd, and pqqc had an increase in copy number with biochar addition but not without treatment. Indirectly, the biochar treatment increased the soil's phosphorus availability by increasing the population of the phosphate-solubilizing bacteria Fusarium and Sphingomonas. Soil phosphorus availability is positively affected by biochar under various water conditions. This impact is due to chemical and microbiological mechanisms.

TI  - A comparison of denitrifying bacterial community structures and abundance in acidic soils between natural forest and re-vegetated forest of Nanling Nature Reserve in southern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Denitrification plays a key role in converting reactive nitrogen species to dinitrogen gas back into the atmosphere to maintain the equilibrium of nitrogen cycling in ecosystems. In this study, functional genes of nirK and nosZ were used to detect the community structure and abundance of denitrifying microorganisms in acidic forest soils in southern China. Three sets of factors were considered for a comparison among 5 forests, including forest types (natural vs. re-vegetated), depths (surface layer vs. lower layer) and seasons (winter vs. summer). The community of nirK gene detected from these acidic forest soils was closely related to Proteobacteria especially alpha-Proteobacteria and uncultured soil sequences, while that of nosZ gene was affiliated with the alpha-, (beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria. Higher diversity of denitrifiers was observed in re-vegetated forest soils than natural ones. Not only the community but also the abundance showed significant differences between forest types as well as depths. The abundance of denitrifiers ranged from 10(5) to 10(7) gene copies g(-1) dry soil in this study. For nirK gene, the abundance was much higher in the lower layer than surface layer in both forest types, and the differences between winter and summer in natural forest soils were higher than those in re-vegetated forest soils. The abundance of nosZ and nirK genes showed a similar trend in natural forest, but the former was higher in matured forest than re vegetated forest. This study provided a direct comparison on community composition and abundance of denitrifying bacteria in natural and re-vegetated acidic forest soils to allow further assessment of the nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Dominant influence of plants on soil microbial carbon cycling functions during natural restoration of degraded karst vegetation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The impacts of natural restoration projects on soil microbial carbon (C) cycling functions have not been well recognized despite their wide implementation in the degraded karst areas of southwest China. In this study, metagenomic sequencing assays were conducted on functional genes and microorganisms related to soil Ccycling at three natural restoration stages (shrubbery, TG; secondary forest, SG; old-growth forest, OG) in the southeast of Guizhou Province, China. The aims were to investigate the changes in microbial potentials responsible for soil C cycling and the underlying driving forces. The natural restoration resulted in vegetation establishment at all three restoration stages, rendering alterations of soil microbial C cycle functions as indicated by metagenomic gene assays. When TG was restored into OG, the number and diversity of genes and microorganisms involved in soil C cycling remained unchanged, but their composition underwent significant shifts. Specifically, microbial potentials for soil C decomposition exhibited an increase driven by the collaborative efforts of plants and soils, while microbial potentials for soil C biosynthesis displayed an initial upswing followed by a subsequent decline which was primarily influenced by plants alone. In comparison to soil nutrients, it was determined that plant diversities served as the primary driving factor for the alterations in microbial carbon cycle potentials. Soil microbial communities involved in C cycling were predominantly attributed to Proteobacteria (31.87%-40.25%) and Actinobacteria (11.29%-26.07%), although their contributions varied across the three restoration stages. The natural restoration of degraded karst vegetation thus influences soil microbial C cycle functions by enhancing C decomposition potentials and displaying a nuanced pattern of biosynthesis potentials, primarily influenced by above-ground plants. These results provide valuable new insights into the regulation of soil C cycling during the restoration of degraded karst vegetation from genetic and microbial perspectives.

TI  - Methanogenesis in Eocene Arctic soils inferred from δ13C of tree fossil carbonates
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB  - We report on the carbon and oxygen stable isotope composition of fossil tree material collected at the White Mountain locality of the Buchanan Lake Formation on Axel Heiberg Island in the High Arctic of Canada. The fossils are Middle Eocene in age and have been permineralized with carbonate. Microscopic examination of fossils revealed them to be the remains of Metasequoia stems, composed of secondary carbonate (calcite) and original wood intermingled at the cellular level. Because the specimens show little compression, crushing, or tissue degradation, we believe that carbonate permineralization occurred soon after burial, and therefore provides insight into Eocene carbon cycling at the locality. The carbon isotope signature of the carbonate suggests that methanogenesis resulted in a C-13-enriched CO2 Pool that equilibrated with soil water and gave rise to unusually C-13-enriched CaCO3. Tree fossil carbonate exhibited strikingly high delta(13)C values (+4.0 to +7.4parts per thousand) compared to published Phanerozoic pedogenic carbonate delta(13)C values. These delta(13)C values, in conjunction with fractionation factors (a) previously determined for carbonate precipitation and methanogenic pathways, indicate an Eocene Soil CO2 pool containing 80-95% CO2 produced as a by-product of acetate-fermentation methanogenesis. Because methane in the atmosphere is a powerful greenhouse gas, we suggest that methane emissions from Axel Heiberg soils contributed to the relatively warm Arctic climate during the Middle Eocene.

TI  - Seasonal nitrous oxide emissions from different land uses and their controlling factors in a tropical riparian ecosystem
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - An important ecological service provided by tropical riparian ecosystems is the mitigation of nutrient pollution (e.g. nitrate) from surrounding agricultural areas. However, a negative impact of this nutrient remediation may be that the ecozone also functions as a major emitter of nitrous oxide (N2O). We hypothesized that the high inorganic nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil water content in tropical riparian ecosystems enhances N2O production through rapid nitrification and denitrification processes. This study was therefore designed to quantify the variability in N2O emissions in such an ecosystem in northern Thailand with specific emphasis on (1) different land uses (comparing replicate leguminous reforestation areas with conventional maize agriculture with high rates of nitrogen fertilizer addition), and (2) temporal aspects (comparing wet and dry seasons). Our aim was to quantify N2O emissions and to identify the major drivers controlling these emissions. Using in situ closed chambers the annual average emissions of N2O from the leguminous reforestation area (3.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1)) was significantly higher than agricultural areas with maize (2.2 kg N2O-N ha(-1) y(-1))). The seasonal variation results indicated that the rate of N2O flux in the wet season was higher than in the dry season. The variations of N2O emission rates were strongly correlated with water filled pore space (WFPS), denitrification, and microbial biomass C, but not with nitrification. This study indicates that when inorganic N and soil organic C are sufficient, WFPS plays an important role in controlling N2O emissions from denitrification. Comparatively, annual N2O emissions from the tropical riparian reforestation were similar to that reported for temperate riparian forests and other ecosystems. Although the annual N2O emissions from the maize agricultural area were comparable to other crops cultivated in riparian ecosystems, it was higher than the N2O fluxes from crops grown in non-riparian zones. We conclude that agricultural lands located in tropical riparian zones do not represent a major hotspot of N2O emissions and that this does not diminish the positive benefits they provide in relation to other aspects of ecosystem service provision.

TI  - Changes. in litter chemistry associated with global change-driven forest succession resulted in time-decoupled responses of soil carbon and nitrogen cycles
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Global change-driven forest succession may modify key soil processes with potentially important impacts over carbon (C) and nutrient cycling. We studied how changes in litter throughout the replacement of Pinus sylvestris by Quercus pyrenaica influence the structure and functioning of soil microbial communities and the capacity of soils to sequester C and retain nitrogen (N). We designed a microcosm experiment to simulate the chronological sequence from pine to oak forest conversion in Central Spain, using mixtures of senescent litter (oak leaves, pine needles and an equal mixture of needles:leaves) and soils (from pure oak, mixed and pure pine stands). We investigated changing patterns of soil C and N contents, microbial community structure (PLFA) and greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4, N2O) across the chronosequence. The succession from pine to oak forest was associated with substantial changes in microbial community structure and functioning. Soil-C sink capacity was reduced, although soil-N availability was enhanced, We further show how effects of secondary succession on the C cycle were mismatched with N dynamics in response to two chronologically decoupled facts. First, there was an acceleration in soil organic matter (SOM) turnover after microbial-especially bacterial-growth ceased to be so intensely inhibited by needle litter (ecotone soils), resulting in lower fungal to bacterial ratios; and second, N mineralization was stimulated once pine-derived SOM was no longer present in soils (pure oak forest soils), resulting in further acceleration of SOM turnover, suppression of CH4 consumption and an increase in gram negative bacteria. Our findings suggest that different sensitivities of key mechanisms (SOM decomposition, N mineralization, CH4 consumption) to factors associated with succession (e.g. recalcitrance of pine SOM and allelopathic effects over bacteria) could have significant impacts on soil microbial ecology, C and nutrient cycling.

TI  - Improving SWAT for simulating water and carbon fluxes of forest ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - As a widely used watershed model for assessing impacts of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on water quantity and quality, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has not been extensively tested in simulating water and carbon fluxes of forest ecosystems. Here, we examine SWAT simulations of evapotranspiration (ET), net primary productivity (NPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and plant biomass at ten AmeriFlux forest sites across the U.S. We identify unrealistic radiation use efficiency (Bio_E), large leaf to biomass fraction (Bio_LEAF), and missing phosphorus supply from parent material weathering as the primary causes for the inadequate performance of the default SWAT model in simulating forest dynamics. By further revising the relevant parameters and processes, SWAT's performance is substantially improved. Based on the comparison between the improved SWAT simulations and flux tower observations, we discuss future research directions for further enhancing model parameterization and representation of water and carbon cycling for forests.

TI  - Thinning reduces soil carbon dioxide but not methane flux from southwestern USA ponderosa pine forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest soils are important components of the global carbon cycle because they both store and release carbon. Carbon dioxide is released from soil to the atmosphere as a result of plant root and microbial respiration. Additionally, soils in dry forests are often sinks of methane from the atmosphere. Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases whose increasing concentration in the atmosphere contributes to climate warming. Thinning treatments are being implemented in ponderosa pine forests across the southwestern United States to restore historic forest structure and reduce the risk of severe wildfire. This study addresses how thinning alters fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane in ponderosa pine forest soils within one year of management and examines mechanisms of change. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes, soil temperature, soil water content, forest floor mass, root mass, understory plant biomass, and soil microbial biomass carbon were measured before and after the implementation of a thinning and in an unthinned forest. Carbon dioxide efflux from soil decreased as a result of thinning in two of three summer months. Average summer carbon dioxide efflux declined by an average of 34 mg C m(-2) hr(-1) in the first year after thinning. Methane oxidation did not change in response to thinning. Thinning had no significant short-term effect on total forest floor mass, total root biomass, or microbial biomass carbon in the mineral soil. Understory plant biomass increased after thinning. Thinning increased carbon available for decomposition by killing tree roots, but our results suggest that thinning reduced carbon dioxide emissions from the soil because the reduction in belowground autotrophic respiration was larger than the stimulation of heterotrophic respiration. Methane oxidation was probably not affected by thinning because thinning did not alter the forest floor mass enough to affect methane diffusion from the atmosphere into the soil.

TI  - Molecular evidence for stimulation of methane oxidation in Amazonian floodplains by ammonia-oxidizing communities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Ammonia oxidation is the rate-limiting first step of nitrification and a key process in the nitrogen cycle that results in the formation of nitrite (NO2-), which can be further oxidized to nitrate (NO3-). In the Amazonian floodplains, soils are subjected to extended seasons of flooding during the rainy season, in which they can become anoxic and produce a significant amount of methane (CH4). Various microorganisms in this anoxic environment can couple the reduction of different ions, such as NO2- and NO3-, with the oxidation of CH4 for energy production and effectively link the carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, we addressed the composition of ammonium (NH4+) and NO3--and NO2--dependent CH4-oxidizing microbial communities in an Amazonian floodplain. In addition, we analyzed the influence of environmental and geochemical factors on these microbial communities. Soil samples were collected from different layers of forest and agroforest land-use systems during the flood and non-flood seasons in the floodplain of the Tocantins River, and next-generation sequencing of archaeal and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons was performed, coupled with chemical characterization of the soils. We found that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were more abundant than ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) during both flood and non-flood seasons. Nitrogen-dependent anaerobic methane oxidizers (N-DAMO) from both the archaeal and bacterial domains were also found in both seasons, with higher abundance in the flood season. The different seasons, land uses, and depths analyzed had a significant influence on the soil chemical factors and also affected the abundance and composition of AOA, AOB, and N-DAMO. During the flood season, there was a significant correlation between ammonia oxidizers and N-DAMO, indicating the possible role of these oxidizers in providing oxidized nitrogen species for methanotrophy under anaerobic conditions, which is essential for nitrogen removal in these soils.

TI  - Long-term nitrogen addition modifies microbial composition and functions for slow carbon cycling and increased sequestration in tropical forest soil
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition is a component of global change that has considerable impact on belowground carbon (C) dynamics. Plant growth stimulation and alterations of fungal community composition and functions are the main mechanisms driving soil C gains following N deposition in N-limited temperate forests. In N-rich tropical forests, however, N deposition generally has minor effects on plant growth; consequently, C storage in soil may strongly depend on the microbial processes that drive litter and soil organic matter decomposition. Here, we investigated how microbial functions in old-growth tropical forest soil responded to 13 years of N addition at four rates: 0 (Control), 50 (Low-N), 100 (Medium-N), and 150 (High-N) kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased under High-N, corresponding to a 33% decrease in CO2 efflux, and reductions in relative abundances of bacteria as well as genes responsible for cellulose and chitin degradation. A 113% increase in N2O emission was positively correlated with soil acidification and an increase in the relative abundances of denitrification genes (narG and norB). Soil acidification induced by N addition decreased available P concentrations, and was associated with reductions in the relative abundance of phytase. The decreased relative abundance of bacteria and key functional gene groups for C degradation were related to slower SOC decomposition, indicating the key mechanisms driving SOC accumulation in the tropical forest soil subjected to High-N addition. However, changes in microbial functional groups associated with N and P cycling led to coincidentally large increases in N2O emissions, and exacerbated soil P deficiency. These two factors partially offset the perceived beneficial effects of N addition on SOC storage in tropical forest soils. These findings suggest a potential to incorporate microbial community and functions into Earth system models considering their effects on greenhouse gas emission, biogeochemical processes, and biodiversity of tropical ecosystems.

TI  - The experimental flow to the Colorado River delta: Effects on carbon mobilization in a dry watercourse
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Here we report on the effects of an experimental flood on the carbon cycling dynamics in the dry watercourse of the Colorado River in Mexico. We observed post- flood differences in the degree of decay, age, and concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as dissolved CH4 and CO2 concentrations throughout the study site. Our results indicate that this flooded waterway was a limited source of CH4 and CO2 to the atmosphere during the event and that DOC age increased with time of flooding. Based on our findings, we suggest that the interplay between storage and mobilization of carbon and greenhouse gases in arid and semiarid regions is potentially sensitive to changing climate conditions, particularly hydrologic variability. Changes in the radiocarbon age of DOC throughout the flooding event suggest that organic matter (OM) that had been stored for long periods (e.g., millennial) was mobilized by the flooding event along with CO2. The OM residing in the dry riverbed that was mobilized into floodwaters had a signature reflective of degraded vascular plant OM and microbial biomass. Whether this microbial OM was living or dead, our findings support previous work in soils and natural waters showing that microbial OM can remain stable and stored in ecosystems for long time periods. As human appropriation of water resources continues to increase, the episodic drying and rewetting of once natural riverbeds and deltas may fundamentally alter the processing and storage of carbon in such systems.

TI  - Iron, sulphur and phosphorus cycling in the rhizosphere sediments of a eutrophic Ruppia cirrhosa meadow (Valle Smarlacca, Italy)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
AB  - The growth dynamics of a residual Ruppia cirrhosa meadow of the eutrophic Valle Smarlacca lagoon, Italy, were monitored over an annual cycle and related to the cycling of iron, sulphur and phosphorus in the rhizosphere sediments. The Ruppia biomass and rates of gross primary production increased during spring and early summer, but declined rapidly thereafter. This biomass decline was particularly evident for the below-ground biomass. Microelectrode profiling demonstrated a clear seasonal trend in sediment redox potential, with the sediments becoming increasingly reduced during spring and summer. in addition, high concentrations of toxic free sulphides (up to 7 mM) were detected in the porewater during summer and autumn. Radial oxygen release by the seagrass roots rather than iron precipitation appears to be the principal detoxification mechanism for sulphides in the rhizosphere. However. in summer this system becomes saturated, leading to the accumulation of free sulphides. This results in a positive feedback regime. with the sulphides causing root/rhizome mortality, which further reduces oxygen release to the rhizosphere and thereby favours sulphate reduction activity and further accumulation of sulphides.
   A redox-dependent exchange of phosphate between the iron-bound, exchangeable and porewater pools was observed. However. these changes were quantitatively of little importance due to the small pool sizes and the very low concentrations of labile ferric iron in the sediments throughout the year.
   Overall. the data indicate that in addition to light competition with other primary producers, eutrophication may also negatively impact seagrass communities through changes in sediment redox and sulphide concentrations. These interactions between eutrophication, water column primary production and bacterial metabolism in the sediment could play a part in the catastrophic collapses of seagrass communities which have been observed in many coastal areas on a worldwide scale.

TI  - Exploring methanogenic archaea and their thermal responses in the glacier-fed stream sediments of Rongbuk River basin, Mt. Everest
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Glacier-fed streams (GFS) are emergent sources of greenhouse gas methane, and methanogenic archaea in sediments contribute largely to stream methane emissions. However, little is known about the methanogenic communities in GFS sediments and their key environmental driving factors. This study analyzed stream sediments from the Rongbuk River basin on Mt. Everest for methanogenic communities and their temperature responses through anaerobic microcosm incubations at 5 degrees C and 15 degrees C. Diverse methanogens were identified, including acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic, and hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic types. Substantial methane and CO2 production were detected across altitudes and increased significantly at 15 degrees C, with both methane and CO2 production rates negatively correlated with altitude. The temperature sensitivity of CO2 production also showed a negative altitude correlation. Methanogens increased substantially over long-term incubation, dominating the archaeal community. At 15 degrees C, the relative abundance of several methanogenic groups was strongly correlated with altitude, with positive correlations observed for Methanomassiliicoccaceae and Methanoregulaceae, and negative correlations for Methanocellaceae, respectively. Besides altitude, phosphorus, carbon to nitrogen ratio, and pH also affected methanogenic structure, methane and CO2 production, and temperature sensitivities. This study offers new insights into methanogens and methane production in GFS sediments, improving our understanding of GFS carbon cycling and its potential responses to climate change.
   Glacier-fed streams harbor diverse methanogenic archaea which showed significant responses to increased temperature.

TI  - Temperatures beyond the community optimum promote the dominance of heat-adapted, fast growing and stress resistant bacteria in alpine soils
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Alpine soils are warming strongly, leading to profound alterations in carbon cycling and greenhouse gas budgets, mediated via the soil microbiome. To explore microbial responses to global warming, we incubated eight alpine soils between 4 and 35 degrees C and linked the temperature dependency of bacterial growth with alterations in community structures and the identification of temperature sensitive taxa. The temperature optimum for bacterial growth was between 27 and 30 degrees C and was higher in soils from warmer environments. This temperature framing the upper limit of naturally occurring temperatures was a tipping point above which the temperature range for growth shifted towards higher temperatures together with pronounced changes in community structures and diversity based on both 16S rRNA gene and transcript sequencing. For instance, at the highest temperature, we observed a strong increase in OTUs affiliated with Burkholderia-Paraburkholderia, Phenylobacterium, Pseudolabrys, Edaphobacter and Sphingomonas. Dominance at high temperature was explained by a priori adaptation to high temperature, high growth potential as well as stress resistance. At the highest temperature, we moreover observed an overall increase in copiotrophic properties in the community along with high growth rates. Further, temperature effects on community structures depended on the long-term climatic legacy of the soils. These findings contribute to extrapolating from single to multiple sites across a large range of conditions.

TI  - Assessing fungal contributions to cellulose degradation in soil by using high-throughput stable isotope probing
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soils represent one of the largest and most active pools of C in the biosphere, and soil respiration represents a major component of global C flux. Fungi are essential to soil carbon cycling due to their propensity for decomposing organic polymers such as cellulose. We performed high throughput sequencing enabled stable isotope probing (HTS-SIP) with C-13-cellulose to characterize the dynamics of fungi and bacteria during cellulose degradation in an agricultural soil. A total of 1900 fungal taxa were observed and 190 of these assimilated C-13-cellulose during a 30-day incubation. A majority of C-13-labeled fungi belonged to Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mucoromycota. However, most C-13-labeled fungi could not be annotated at the species (71%, n = 134), or genus (49%, n = 93) level. Mucoromycota were C-13-labeled early, and by day 3 the most abundant C-13-labeled organism belonged to Mortierella. In contrast, C-13-labeled Ascomycota increased in diversity through day 14 and their relative abundance comprised more than 40% of fungal ITS sequences by day 30. These results show that: i) the majority of fungal taxa that assimilated C-13 from C-13-cellulose are uncultivated and poorly characterized, ii) the beta-diversity of C-13-labeled fungi changed significantly over time during cellulose degradation, a relatively small number of the C-13-labeled taxa dominated the community response to cellulose, and iv) fungi incorporated cellulose into DNA more rapidly and in greater numbers than did bacteria. These results show that fungi in a tilled agricultural field respond rapidly to new cellulose inputs, exhibiting complex temporal dynamics that likely drive carbon flow into diverse taxa within the soil community.

TI  - Cd bioavailability and nitrogen cycling microbes interaction affected by mixed amendments under paddy-pak choi continued planting
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is the most concerning soil pollutant, and a threat to human health, especially in China. The in-situ immobilization of Cadmium by amendments is one of the most widely adopted methods to remedy soil contamination. The study was designed to evaluate the effect of organo-chemical amendments on soil Cd bioavailability and nitrogen cycling microbes under continuous planting of rice (Oryza sativa) and pak choi (Brassica chinensis L.). The experiment was carried out using four amendments, Lime, Zeolite, Superphosphate, and Biochar, at two different ratios; M1: at the ratio of 47:47:5:1, and M2 at the ratio of 71:23:5:1, respectively. Moreover, both M1 and M2 were enriched at four levels (T1: 0.5%; T2: 1%; T3: 2%; T4: 4%). Results showed that compared with CK (Cd enriched soils), the yield of rice under treatments of M1T1 and M2T1 increased by 8.93% and 8.36%, respectively. While the biomass (fresh weight) of pak choi under M1 and M2 amendments increased by 2.52-2.98 times and 0.76-2.89 times respectively, under enrichment treatments T1, T2, and T3. The total Cd concentrations in rice grains treated with M1T3 and M2T3 decreased by 89.25% and 93.16%, respectively, compared with CK. On the other hand, the total Cd concentrations in pak choi under M1T3 and M2T2 decreased by 92.86% and 90.23%, respectively. The results showed that soil pH was the main factor affecting Cd bioavailability in rice and pak choi. The Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) of rice and pak choi showed that soil pH was the most significant contributing factor. In the rice season, the contribution of soil pH (P) on Cd bioavailability was 10.14% (P = 0.102), and in the pak choi season, the contribution of soil pH was 8.38% (P = 0.133). Furthermore, the abundance of ammonia oxidation and denitrifying microorganisms had significantly correlation with soil pH and exchange Cd. In rice season, when the enrichment level of amendments increased from 0.5% (T1) to 2% (T3), the gene abundance of AOA, AOB, nirK, nirS and nosZ (Iota) tended to decrease. While in pak choi season, when the enrichment level increased at the level of 0.5% (T1), 1% (T2), and 2% (T3), the gene abundance of AOB, nirS, and nosZ (Iota) increased. Additionally, the gene abundance of AOA and nirK showed a reduction in the pak choi season contrasting to rice. And the mixed amendment M2 performed better at reducing Cd uptake than M1, which may have correlation with the ratio of lime and zeolite in them. Finally, we conclude that between these two amendments, when applied at a moderate level M2 type performed better than M1 in reducing Cd uptake, and also showed positive effects on both gene abundance and increase soil pH.

TI  - Spatial patterns and influencing factors of soil SOC?DOC?ROC at initial stage of vegetation restoration in a karst area
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Vegetation restoration has always been the focus of ecological research, but the synergistic effect of the soil carbon cycle and vegetation restoration succession process in karst area is still unclear. In this study, the complete succession zones of non-karst, karst, and karst vegetation restoration landforms in a National Nature Reserve, Caohai (Guizhou Province, China), were compared. The content distribution characteristics of SOC, ROC and DOC were investigated, as well as the geomorphology, spatial location and interaction were studied by using GLMM. The results show that the soil types and vegetation coverage of different landforms lead to a decrease in SOC in karst area with an increase in depth. The soil content in karst area was low, and in order to maintain the normal growth of vegetation, the proportion of soil ROC and DOC in SOC must be high, which leads to the order of soil ROC content in unrepaired area > vegetation restoration area > non-karst area. In addition, the content of SOC in the surface layer of the vegetation restoration area was lower than that of the unrepaired area and the non-karst area. The soil microbial activity in the vegetation restoration area is stronger, and more organic carbon was fixed in the plant. The vegetation coverage and diversity increased obviously and markedly as a result of dominant plants changing (from Gramineae to Gramineae + Compositae) in the karst vegetation restoration area, but the soil in the karst area could not provide sufficient nutrition for plants, ultimately resulting in an inverse ratio between surface SOC and vegetation diversity. This study aims to enhance understandings of ecological functions and vegetation restoration in karst areas, as well as responses to regional carbon cycling.

TI  - Molecular investigations into a globally important carbon pool: permafrost-protected carbon in Alaskan soils
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The fate of carbon (C) contained within permafrost in boreal forest environments is an important consideration for the current and future carbon cycle as soils warm in northern latitudes. Currently, little is known about the microbiology or chemistry of permafrost soils that may affect its decomposition once soils thaw. We tested the hypothesis that low microbial abundances and activities in permafrost soils limit decomposition rates compared with active layer soils. We examined active layer and permafrost soils near Fairbanks, AK, the Yukon River, and the Arctic Circle. Soils were incubated in the lab under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Gas fluxes at -5 and 5 degrees C were measured to calculate temperature response quotients (Q(10)). The Q(10) was lower in permafrost soils (average 2.7) compared with active layer soils (average 7.5). Soil nutrients, leachable dissolved organic C (DOC) quality and quantity, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the soils revealed that the organic matter within permafrost soils is as labile, or even more so, than surface soils. Microbial abundances (fungi, bacteria, and subgroups: methanogens and Basidiomycetes) and exoenzyme activities involved in decomposition were lower in permafrost soils compared with active layer soils, which, together with the chemical data, supports the reduced Q(10) values. CH4 fluxes were correlated with methanogen abundance and the highest CH4 production came from active layer soils. These results suggest that permafrost soils have high inherent decomposability, but low microbial abundances and activities reduce the temperature sensitivity of C fluxes. Despite these inherent limitations, however, respiration per unit soil C was higher in permafrost soils compared with active layer soils, suggesting that decomposition and heterotrophic respiration may contribute to a positive feedback to warming of this eco region.

TI  - Organic matter decay and bacterial community succession in mangroves under simulated climate change scenarios
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Mangroves are coastal environments that provide resources for adjacent ecosystems due to their high productivity, organic matter decomposition, and carbon cycling by microbial communities in sediments. Since the industrial revolution, the increase of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) released due to fossil fuel burning led to many environmental abnormalities such as an increase in average temperature and ocean acidification. Based on the hypothesis that climate change modifies the microbial diversity associated with decaying organic matter in mangrove sediments, this study aimed to evaluate the microbial diversity under simulated climate change conditions during the litter decomposition process and the emission of GHG. Thus, microcosms containing organic matter from the three main plant species found in mangroves throughout the State of S & atilde;o Paulo, Brazil (Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, and Avicennia schaueriana) were incubated simulating climate changes (increase in temperature and pH). The decay rate was higher in the first seven days of incubation, but the differences between the simulated treatments were minor. GHG fluxes were higher in the first ten days and higher in samples under increased temperature. The variation in time resulted in substantial impacts on alpha-diversity and community composition, initially with a greater abundance of Gammaproteobacteria for all plant species despite the climate conditions variations. The PCoA analysis reveals the chronological sequence in beta-diversity, indicating the increase of Deltaproteobacteria at the end of the process. The GHG emission varied in function of the organic matter source with an increase due to the elevated temperature, concurrent with the rise in the Deltaproteobacteria population. Thus, these results indicate that under the expected climate change scenario for the end of the century, the decomposition rate and GHG emissions will be potentially higher, leading to a harmful feedback loop of GHG production. This process can happen independently of an impact on the bacterial community structure due to these changes.

TI  - Effects of Sea Animal Activities on Tundra Soil Denitrification and nirS- and nirK-Encoding Denitrifier Community in Maritime Antarctica
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - In maritime Antarctica, sea animals, such as penguins or seals, provide a large amount of external nitrogen input into tundra soils, which greatly impact nitrogen cycle in tundra ecosystems. Denitrification, which is closely related with the denitrifiers, is a key step in nitrogen cycle. However, effects of sea animal activities on tundra soil denitrification and denitrifier community structures still have received little attention. Here, the abundance, activity, and diversity of nirS- and nirK-encoding denitrifiers were investigated in penguin and seal colonies, and animal-lacking tundra in maritime Antarctica. Sea animal activities increased the abundances of nirS and nirK genes, and the abundances of nirS genes were significantly higher than those of nirK genes (p< 0.05) in all tundra soils. Soil denitrification rates were significantly higher (p< 0.05) in animal colonies than in animal-lacking tundra, and they were significantly positively correlated (p< 0.05) with nirS gene abundances instead of nirK gene abundances, indicating that nirS-encoding denitrifiers dominated the denitrification in tundra soils. The diversity of nirS-encoding denitrifiers was higher in animal colonies than in animal-lacking tundra, but the diversity of nirK-encoding denitrifiers was lower. Both the compositions of nirS- and nirK-encoding denitrifiers were similar in penguin or seal colony soils. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the community structures of nirS- and nirK-encoding denitrifiers were closely related to tundra soil biogeochemical processes associated with penguin or seal activities: the supply of nitrate and ammonium from penguin guano or seal excreta, and low C:N ratios. In addition, the animal activity-induced vegetation presence or absence had an important effect on tundra soil denitrifier activities and nirK-encoding denitrifier diversities. This study significantly enhanced our understanding of the compositions and dynamics of denitrifier community in tundra ecosystems of maritime Antarctica.

TI  - MICROBIAL INHIBITION AND NITRIFICATION POTENTIAL IN SOILS INCUBATED WITH ELAEAGNUS-ANGUSTIFOLIA L LEAF-LITTER
T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - The reasons for nitrification inhibition in some soils are controversial. We studied the effect of Elaeagnus angustifolia leaf litter (a host plant able to fix atmospheric nitrogen via root-nodule symbiosis with an actinomycete of the genus Frankia) on the density and activity of nitrifying microorganisms present in degraded soils. Soils were incubated with and without leaf litter, and it was seen that increased denitrification, CO2-induced inhibition, or nitrite and ammonia fixation by organic matter did not decrease nitrification. Our results suggest allelopathic inhibition by leaf litter and indicate that the introduction of E. angustifolia could improve degraded soils because it stimulates nitrogen conservation.

TI  - Metagenomes reveal the effect of crop rotation systems on phosphorus cycling functional genes and soil phosphorus avail-ability
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The use of different cropping systems affects soil phosphorus (P) availability. Microbes play a main role in regulating soil P cycling. Currently, there is a knowledge gap on the effects of the long-term use of different crop rotation systems on microbial functional genes involved in P cycling on soil P availability. In this study, metagenomics was used to determine microbial functional genes involved in P cycling in a 12-year experiment that included three crop rotation systems: wheat-maize rotation (WM), wheat-cotton rotation (WC), and wheat-soybean rotation (WS). WS had a significantly higher AP content than WC (37.3%) and WM (41.5%). Further analysis of the soil microbial population showed that WS mainly enriched the abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes from the phylum to genus levels. For the P-cycling genes, WS significantly increased the P-cycling gene abundance of organic P mineralization (phoD, phnA, and phnP) compared with WC and WM. WC enhanced the microbial function of the Inorganic P solubilization genes gcd and gppa. WM enhanced the function of polyphosphate degradation, and the abundance of genes spoT and ppnK was significantly increased in WM soil compared with WC and WS soil. In addition, our structural equation model and network analysis showed that the organic P mineralization gene abundance had a significant effect on the available P content; the effect coefficients were 0.73, and the organic P mineralization genes phoD, phnA, and phnP, which were enriched in WS soil, were keystone genes in the process of increasing the soil-available P. Our results highlight the relationship between P cycle functions and cropping systems, which also has implications for enhancing P availability through the use of different crop systems in agricultural production.

TI  - Exploring microscale heterogeneity as a driver of biogeochemical transformations and gas transport in peat
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Peat pore network architecture is a key determinant of water retention and gas transport properties and has therefore been hypothesized to control redox conditions in and greenhouse gas emissions from peat soils. Yet, experimental approaches to directly visualize the spatial heterogeneity of biogeochemical reactions in pore networks remain scarce. Here, we report on a 13C pulse-chase assay developed to functionally explain and visualize the centimeter-scale heterogeneity in greenhouse gas emissions in peat cores. We injected a 13C-labeled substrate (13C2 acetate) at 2 to 8 cm depths and monitored its conversion into CO2 and CH4. We then measured the pore network architecture of the same cores by X-ray microtomographic imaging and constructed the air-filled pore networks using pore network modeling. We applied this approach to peat cores collected at a drained peatland forest in southern Finland in an experiment to study the effects of water hysteresis, i.e., differences between peat cores that reached a given water potential (-20 hPa) from drier or wetter conditions. We find large heterogeneity among the replicate cores and injections, indicating the effects of centimeter-scale heterogeneity on biochemical processes and gas transport. These treatments resulted in similar average air-filled porosity but distinct pore networks (higher coordination numbers and clustering coefficients in drying compared to wetting soils) and within-core water distribution. Substrate injection experiments revealed less (potential) microbial activity (less of the substrate emitted as CO2) at greater depth in both treatments. In peat cores from the drying treatment we also find a slower microbial response to label additions at greater depths (slower release of label-derived CO2), while the timing of emissions did not vary in wetting treatments. Air-filled porosity and pore network metrics could not explain the fraction of label converted to CO2, but greater porosity was associated with slower CO2 emissions, whereas higher clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality (two measures of pore network properties) were associated with faster emissions.

TI  - Climate Clever Beef: options to improve business performance and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in northern Australia
T2  - RANGELAND JOURNAL
AB  - The Rangeland Journal - Climate Clever Beef special issue examines options for the beef industry in northern Australia to contribute to the reduction in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to engage in the carbon economy. Relative to its gross value (A$5 billion), the northern beef industry is responsible for a sizable proportion of national reportable GHG emissions (8-10%) through enteric methane, savanna burning, vegetation clearing and land degradation. The industry occupies large areas of land and has the potential to impact the carbon cycle by sequestering carbon or reducing carbon loss. Furthermore, much of the industry is currently not achieving its productivity potential, which suggests that there are opportunities to improve the emissions intensity of beef production. Improving the industry's GHG emissions performance is important for its environmental reputation and may benefit individual businesses through improved production efficiency and revenue from the carbon economy. The Climate Clever Beef initiative collaborated with beef businesses in six regions across northern Australia to better understand the links between GHG emissions and carbon stocks, land condition, herd productivity and profitability. The current performance of businesses was measured and alternate management options were identified and evaluated. Opportunities to participate in the carbon economy through the Australian Government's Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) were also assessed. The initiative achieved significant producer engagement and collaboration resulting in practice change by 78 people from 35 businesses, managing more than 1272000ha and 132000 cattle. Carbon farming opportunities were identified that could improve both business performance and emissions intensity. However, these opportunities were not without significant risks, trade-offs and limitations particularly in relation to business scale, and uncertainty in carbon price and the response of soil and vegetation carbon sequestration to management. This paper discusses opportunities for reducing emissions, improving emission intensity and carbon sequestration, and outlines the approach taken to achieve beef business engagement and practice change. The paper concludes with some considerations for policy makers.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of carbohydrate-active enzymes and their contribution to marine sediment biodiversity
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Marine sediments constitute the world's most substantial long-term carbon repository. The microorganisms dwelling in these sediments mediate the transformation of fixed oceanic carbon, but their contribution to the carbon cycle is not fully understood. Previous culture-independent investigations into sedimentary microorganisms have underscored the significance of carbohydrates in the carbon cycle. In this study, we employ a metagenomic methodology to investigate the distribution and abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in 37 marine sediments sites. These sediments exhibit varying oxygen availability and were isolated in diverse regions worldwide. Our comparative analysis is based on the metabolic potential for oxygen utilisation, derived from genes present in both oxic and anoxic environments. We found that extracellular CAZyme modules targeting the degradation of plant and algal detritus, necromass, and host glycans were abundant across all metagenomic samples. The analysis of these results indicates that the oxic/anoxic conditions not only influence the taxonomic composition of the microbial communities, but also affect the occurrence of CAZyme modules involved in the transformation of necromass, algae and plant detritus. To gain insight into the sediment microbial taxa, we reconstructed metagenome assembled genomes (MAG) and examined the presence of primary extracellular carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) modules. Our findings reveal that the primary CAZyme modules and the CAZyme gene clusters discovered in our metagenomes were prevalent in the Bacteroidia, Gammaproteobacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria classes. We compared those MAGs to organisms from the same taxonomic classes found in soil, and we found that they were similar in its CAZyme repertoire, but the soil MAG contained a more abundant and diverse CAZyme content. Furthermore, the data indicate that abundant classes in our metagenomic samples, namely Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia and Gammaproteobacteria, play a pivotal role in carbohydrate transformation within the initial few metres of the sediments.

TI  - Home-field advantage accelerates leaf litter decomposition in forests
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Several leaf litter decay studies have indicated that decomposition occurs more rapidly when litter is placed beneath the plant species from which it had been derived than beneath a different plant species (i.e. home-field advantage, HFA), although support for this notion has not been universal. We provide the first quantification of HFA in relation to leaf litter decomposition using published litter mass loss data from forest ecosystems in North America, South America, and Europe. Our findings indicate that HFA is widespread in forest ecosystems, on average litter mass loss was 8% faster at home than away. We hypothesize that HFA results from specialization of the soil biotic community in decomposing litter derived from the plant above it. Climate and initial litter quality data can be used to explain about 70% of the variability in litter decomposition at a global scale, leaving about 30% unexplained. We suggest that HFA be recognized as a factor that explains some of this remaining variability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phenotype MicroArray™ system in the study of fungal functional diversity and catabolic versatility
T2  - RESEARCH IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Fungi cover a range of important ecological functions associated with nutrient and carbon cycling in leaf litter and soil. As a result, research on existing relationships between fungal functional diversity, decomposition rates and competition is of key interest. Indeed, availability of nutrients in soil is largely the consequence of organic matter degradation dynamics. The Biolog (R) Phenotype MicroArrays (TM) (PM) system allows for the testing of fungi against many different carbon sources at any one time. The use and potential of the PM system as a tool for studying niche overlap and catabolic versatility of saprotrophic fungi is discussed here, and examples of its application are provided.

TI  - Carbonate Accumulation in the Bark of Terminalia bellirica: A New Habitat for the Oxalate-Carbonate Pathway
T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Oxalate oxidation and carbonate precipitation associated with the oxalogenic tree Terminalia bellirica were investigated. Calcium oxalate crystals, oxalotrophic bacteria (dominated by genera Methylobacterium and Burkholderia), and carbonate accumulation (82% dry weight), were detected in the bark. In contrast, only a slight accumulation of carbonate was observed in soil (1.5%). The combined geochemical and microbiological analyses suggest that bark of an Indian living tree represents a novel habitat for the accumulation of carbonate associated with bacterial oxalate oxidation. The importance of these types of habitats needs to be quantified when considering the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and calcium in tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Distinct variabilities of soil abundant and rare bacteria relate differently to carbon cycling functionality in eroded ecosystems
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Elucidating the interaction between microorganisms and soil carbon cycling functionality (SCCF) in the eroded ecosystems, can improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which soil erosion and deposition affect soil organic carbon pool. Abundant and rare sub-communities are the integral components in driving SCCF. However, changes in abundant and rare sub-communities, as well as their contributions to SCCF, remain unclear in the eroded ecosystems. In this study, changes in abundant and rare sub-communities and their correlations with SCCF were comparatively explored with respect to soil erosion and deposition in the Loess Plateau. The alpha-diversity of rare sub-communities in the depositional zones was 4% higher than that in the eroding slopes, but there was no significant difference in alpha-diversity of abundant sub-communities between the eroding slopes and depositional zones. The compositions of abundant and rare sub-communities differed between the eroding slopes and depositional zones. Regarding the co-occurrence network of the eroded ecosystems, abundant subcommunities compared with rare sub-communities presented a higher degree and betweenness centrality; however, rare sub-communities possessed more frequent interactions with other species than abundant subcommunities, especially positive interactions. The alpha-diversity of abundant and rare sub-communities in ecological clusters showed positive links with SCCF. The link between alpha-diversity of abundant sub-communities and SCCF was weaker than that with rare sub-communities, which was related to the significant disparity in the abundance of functional genes involved in SCCF and the extent of functional redundancy between abundant and rare sub-communities in the eroded ecosystems. The functional difference of abundant and rare sub-communities in improving SCCF under soil erosion and deposition, is important for accurately assessing the effects of microbial communities on soil organic carbon pool in regions predominated with fragmented eroded landscapes.

TI  - Links between soil microstructure dynamics and carbon cycling in response to land use and climate change
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Land-use systems differ in the balance between organic carbon inputs and microbial mineralization, affecting long-term soil carbon storage. Perennial grasslands maintain continuous root growth without tillage, promoting the accumulation of stable soil microstructure and biopores. In contrast, annual croplands experience fallow periods and periodic plowing, which disturb soil microstructure and accelerate the mineralization of physically protected carbon. However, the strength of soil microstructural regulation on carbon cycling and its responses to climate change remains unclear. Here, we studied five land-use types (two croplands and three grasslands) under ambient and future climate scenarios over five years, starting from the fifth year after establishment. The future climate scenario reflected regional projections of increased temperature and modified precipitation regimes. Using deep-learning-based X-ray CT image segmentation, we found that grasslands consistently contained higher volumes of biopores, particulate organic matter (POM), and decaying roots due to sustained root activity and turnover. Croplands exhibited a higher relative amount of fresh root in spring probably due to the rapid earlyseason growth of annual species, reduced microbial activity during fallow periods, and lack of year-round root inputs. A typical grassland microstructure fully developed in topsoil (5-10 cm) after 4-5 years. Land-use differences in deep soil (35-40 cm) remained small even after 10 years. Microbial biomass carbon and extractable organic carbon were consistently greater in grasslands, whereas total organic carbon diverged more slowly. The future climate scenario primarily influenced heterotrophic respiration and labile carbon pools through soil moisture, but did not significantly alter topsoil microstructure or carbon pools. POM volume, rather than pore structure, was the key driver of carbon mineralization, as the aeration of these microbial hotspots was not limiting. These findings highlight the potential of microstructure characteristics like root channel density and root degradation indicators to quantify long-term ecosystem development including carbon storage.

TI  - Biological and terrestrial influences on dissolved organic matter in Antarctic surface waters: Insights from mass spectrometry and metagenomic analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Global warming increases the surface waters and biodiversity in polar regions. However, the intrinsic biological sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Antarctic surface waters remain poorly understood. This work evaluated the sources and driving mechanisms of DOM in Antarctic lakes systematically, based on fluorescence excitation-emission matrices, ultrahigh-resolution mass spectra, biological detection, and metagenomic analyses. The most abundant DOM in the water was peptides (37.02%), which differed from those in soil (lignins: 26.33%) and penguin guano (lipids: 50.71%). The relative abundance of CHON and CHOP compounds in water was significantly correlated with the distance from the penguin colony (p < 0.05). Both the fluorescence and mass spectrum fingerprints of water and soil/faeces showed low similarities using end-member source tracking methods. This could be attributed to the facilitation of guano-derived nutrients to phytoplankton proliferation, whereas the concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3--N, total phosphorus, and total organic carbon were significantly higher in the penguin-intensive area than in the other areas. Algae had significant positive effects on carbohydrates and amino sugars and positive effects on lignins, compared to zooplankton and bacteria. Zooplankton had significantly more positive effects on peptides than phytoplankton. Secondary bacterial metabolic activity can be positively linked with CHO compounds. Carbohydrates and amino sugars co-occurred with carbohydrate-active enzyme genes and nitrogen cycling genes in one module of the co-occurrence network, whereas the other module was characterised by the co-occurrence patterns of condensed aromatic structures with carbohydrate-active enzyme genes and nitrogen cycling genes. These results emphasise the roles of secondary metabolites from algae and bacteria in species-specific sources of DOM, shedding light on the driving mechanisms of the biogeochemical cycling of DOM in the Antarctic water environment.

TI  - Plant soil interactions alter carbon cycling in an upland grassland soil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil carbon (C) storage is dependent upon the complex dynamics of fresh and native organic matter cycling, which are regulated by plant and soil-microbial activities. A fundamental challenge exists to link microbial biodiversity with plant soil C cycling processes to elucidate the underlying mechanisms regulating soil carbon. To address this, we contrasted vegetated grassland soils with bare soils, which had been plant-free for 3 years, using stable isotope (C-13) labeled substrate assays and molecular analyses of bacterial communities. Vegetated soils had higher C and N contents, biomass, and substrate-specific respiration rates. Conversely, following substrate addition unlabeled, native soil C cycling was accelerated in bare soil and retarded in vegetated soil; indicative of differential priming effects. Functional differences were reflected in bacterial biodiversity with Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria dominating vegetated and bare soils, respectively. Significant isotopic enrichment of soil RNA was found after substrate addition and rates varied according to substrate type. However, assimilation was independent of plant presence which, in contrast to large differences in (CO2)-C-13 respiration rates, indicated greater substrate C use efficiency in bare, Acidobacteria-dominated soils. Stable isotope probing (SIP) revealed most community members had utilized substrates with little evidence for competitive out growth of sub-populations. Our findings support theories on how plant-mediated soil resource availability affects the turnover of different pools of soil carbon, and we further identify a potential role of soil microbial biodiversity. Specifically we conclude that emerging theories on the life histories of dominant soil taxa can be invoked to explain changes in soil carbon cycling linked to resource availability, and that there is a strong case for considering microbial biodiversity in future studies investigating the turnover of different pools of soil carbon.

TI  - Effects of steam disinfestation on community structure, abundance and activity of heterotrophic, denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria in an organic farming soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Steam disinfestation is an ecologically less harmful alternative to synthetic chemical fumigants such as methyl bromide, which is being phased out of use due to its ozone-depleting properties. Although previous studies have characterized the effects of steaming on targeted pests, soil microorganisms, including beneficial ones, may be strongly influenced by this agricultural practice, since: (1) high temperature disturbs most soil microorganisms: and (2) disinfestation-induced changes in the soil environment can indirectly affect soil microbiota. The impact of soil disinfiestation on functional bacterial communities was evaluated particularly in view of their role in nitrogen cycling. The short-term effects of steam disinfestation on heterotrophic bacteria, denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria, and their ability to recover after this disturbance were examined by surveying the enzyme activity, size and genetic structure of each community. Our results show that: (1) steaming immediately induced significant decrease in community activity and size, and changes in community composition, nitrifying bacteria being mostly affected; (2) abundances of each community reached values equal or higher than those observed in control soil within 15-60 days after steaming, but community structures remained very different as compared to those in control soil; and (3) for each activity, no complete recovery was observed after the disturbance: substrate induced respiration and denitrification increased but remained lower in steamed soil, whereas nitrification was not detectable after 62 days. Our results show that these effects of steaming on key soil functional communities can have important, long-lasting implications for nitrogen cycle that should be taken into account when evaluating the influence of such an agricultural practice.

TI  - The role of Collembola in carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
CP  - 10th International Colloquium on Apterygota
AB  - The article reviews recent publications dealing with relationships between Collembola, carbon and nitrogen turnover. Under field conditions, correlations between Collembola, total C and N are usually weak. More pronounced interdependences can be found with microbial parameters, especially when using multivariate statistics and sampling at high temporal resolution. Many manipulation experiments have revealed strong and usually positive impacts of Collembola on N mineralisation, soil respiration, leaching of dissolved organic carbon and plant growth. The effects are mostly indirect and depend on temperature, water content, substrate quality, population density, Collembola species, plant species and in particular on interactions with other soil biota. Key mechanisms are fungal feeding, distribution of fungal propagules, root herbivory and predation on nematodes. Omnivory is probably the prevailing feeding strategy in Collembola. Finally, a tentative conceptual model for arable soils is given, explaining the differing effects of Collembola on C and N turnover by switching feeding strategies according to environmental conditions.

TI  - Dual roles of dissolved organic nitrogen in groundwater nitrogen cycling: Nitrate precursor and denitrification promoter
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) has been reported to be prevalent in groundwater worldwide. Owing to the diversity of physicochemical properties, DON plays complex roles in nitrogen cycling processes, which has further implications for nitrate (NO3--N) pollution control in groundwater. To characterize these crucial roles, we investigated the effects of three types of DON (amino acid, urea, and protein) on NO3--N accumulation in groundwater with a 60-day incubation experiment and established quantitative correlations between microbial indicators (bacterial communities and nitrogen functional genes) and nitrogen content. The results showed that NO3--N content increased by 30.3% and 38.8% and was strongly correlated with the presence of amino acid and urea; however, the addition of protein did not lead to an additional increase in NO3--N, possibly due to different extents of mineralization and denitrification caused by different types of DON. Molecular biological experiments demonstrated that Nitrospira (1.8-3.2%) contributed to nitrification in the urea treatment, whereas Arthrobacter (2.0-6.9%) and Thermomonas (11.9-13.1%) were key communities controlling denitrification in amino acid and protein treatments. amoA and nxrA were continuously enriched in the presence of urea; however, amino acid and protein were strongly correlated with napA-dominated and narG-dominated denitrification processes, with the path coefficient - 2.912 and - 2.450 respectively. Combined analyses showed that DON with distinct physicochemical properties played dual roles (NO3--N) precursor and denitrification promoter) to varying degrees, which could have significant impacts on NO3--N accumulation in groundwater. This study may provide guidance for environmental risk evaluation and control strategies for NO3--N pollution in groundwater. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Crab bioturbation reduces carbon storage in salt marshes under more robust mechanisms than plant invasiveness
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction The macrobenthos are crucial for the stability of estuarine ecosystems due to their burrowing behavior in the sediment and their uptake of nutrients from plants. These activities lead to significant alterations in both the morphological and biogeochemical processes within the region.
   Methods However, there is limited investigation into carbon cycling processes specifically related to crab bioturbation. Additionally, few studies have examined enzymatic activities and carbon fractions in sediments from crab burrow walls at different crab growth stages. This study aims to explore the impact of both plant invasiveness and crab bioturbation on carbon storage.
   Results Our findings suggest that plant invasion leads to higher organic accumulation due to the reduction of recalcitrant organic carbon (ROC) (decreased by 11.6% in invasive and 62.6% in native site from April to December), faster photosynthetic rates (25.8 mu mol/m(2) s in invasive and 10.7 mu mol/m(2) s in native site), and an increased presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the soil over time. However, the increase of easy oxidized carbon (EOC) may lead to less carbon storage in soil (increase by 67.7% in invasive and 48.8% in native site from April to December). In addition to invasiveness, the bioturbation activities of macrobenthos also affect carbon storage. Sediments from crab burrows exhibit higher EOC content (33.6% more than the bulk soil) and higher levels of carbon cycling-related enzymes, including S-ACT, S-beta-GC, and S-ACP activities (24.2%, 8.99%, and 135.6% higher than the bulk soil, respectively).
   Discussion These changes contribute to reduced carbon accumulation in the soil. Therefore, crab bioturbation is a more significant factor affecting carbon sink capacity than plant invasion.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and their contribution to nitrification in wheat rhizospheres
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsThe temporal variations in ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) abundance, diversity, ecological characteristics and nitrification rate in the wheat rhizosphere, as well as the impact of exogenous nitrogen addition were investigated. Our goal was to elucidate the role of AOA in the nitrogen cycle of wheat rhizosphere ecosystems and a microbial perspective for sustainable agricultural development.MethodsThe quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing technology were used to explore the variations of AOA community abundance and ecological characteristics among wheat growth stages and their environmental impact. Based on the loss of ammonia nitrogen concentration per unit time, the potential nitrification rate of wheat root soil was measured. Finally, based on the control experiment, this study further explored the response AOA community and nitrification rate to nitrogen addition.ResultsBoth AOA abundance and nitrification rates were significantly influenced by seasonal changes. During the vegetative growth stage (VGSS), AOA abundance and the nitrification rate reached its peak, and during the reproductive growth stage (RGSS) fell to a low. The alpha-and beta-diversity characteristics of AOA communities showed significant differences across seasons. with VGSS soils showing higher network connectivity and complexity compared to RGSS soils. These differences suggest that random processes primarily regulated community assembly during VGSS. Additionally, exogenous nitrogen addition significantly increased AOA abundance and nitrification rates, with the most pronounced effects observed in the high nitrogen group, indicating that nitrogen availability is a key factor influencing AOA activity and nitrification efficiency in farmland soils.ConclusionsOur study provides new insights into the role of AOA in the farmland soil nitrogen cycle, and highlights the potential of microbial management strategies to facilitate nitrification and contribute to agricultural sustainability.

TI  - Sediment Bacteria and Phosphorus Fraction Response, Notably to Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticle Exposure
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Titanium dioxide nanoparticle (TiO2 NP) toxicity to the growth of organisms has been gradually clarified; however, its effects on microorganism-mediated phosphorus turnover are poorly understood. To evaluate the influences of TiO2 NPs on phosphorus fractionation and the bacterial community, aquatic microorganisms were exposed to different concentrations of TiO2 NPs with different exposure times (i.e., 0, 10, and 30 days). We observed the adhesion of TiO2 NPs to the cell surfaces of planktonic microbes by using SEM, EDS, and XRD techniques. The addition of TiO2 NPs resulted in a decrease in the total phosphorus of water and an increase in the total phosphorus of sediments. Additionally, elevated TiO2 NPs enhanced the sediment activities of reductases (i.e., dehydrogenase [0.19-2.25 mu g/d/g] and catalase [1.06-2.92 mu mol/d/g]), and significantly decreased the absolute abundances of phosphorus-cycling-related genes (i.e., gcd [1.78 x 10(4)-9.55 x 10(5) copies/g], phoD [5.50 x 10(3)-5.49 x 10(7) copies/g], pstS [4.17 x 10(2)-1.58 x 10(6) copies/g]), and sediment bacterial diversity. TiO2 NPs could noticeably affect the bacterial community, showing dramatic divergences in relative abundances (e.g., Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Firmicutes), coexistence patterns, and functional redundancies (e.g., translation and transcription). Our results emphasized that the TiO2 NP amount-rather than the exposure time-showed significant effects on phosphorus fractions, enzyme activity, phosphorus-cycling-related gene abundance, and bacterial diversity, whereas the exposure time exhibited a greater influence on the composition and function of the sediment bacterial community than the TiO2 NP amount. Our findings clarify the responses of phosphorus fractions and the bacterial community to TiO2 NP exposure in the water-sediment ecosystem and highlight potential environmental risks of the migration of untreated TiO2 NPs to aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - The response of the carbon cycle in undisturbed forest ecosystems to climate change: A review of plant-soil models
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - We compared six plant-soil models from the literature which describe the C-dynamics in forests and include climatic forcing explicitly. Our selection included the two physiological models FOREST-BGC and TCX, the ecosystem/population model FORCLIM, two ecosystem/tissue models, MBL-GEM and CENTURY Forest and the global model TEM. The review revealed a multitude of differences with respect to the model structure, the incorporation of particular processes and the coupling with the abiotic environment; We made an assessment of what kind of questions the models can be best applied to and how well they are suited for studying the response of the C cycle under climate change. In this context organic C in litter and humus play a key role. The number of compartments and the pathways of C flows influence both the transient phase and equilibrium of the system, a fact that has been recognized before, but has not been investigated systematically for any of the models. Hence, the multitude of aggregation levels used to represent detritus and the variety of decomposition formulations used in the models may result in inconsistencies of the simulation results. Similarly, the control of ecoprocesses via abiotic factors differs among the models. They use distinct abiotic quantities and different mathematical parametrizations, thereby affecting the system's response in a changing environment substantially, even if this is not the case for present conditions. Given the differences in experimental frames of published simulations it was not possible to trace back behaviour deviations to particular model formulations. In order to make consistent projections of the C cycle's response in forests in a changing climate there remains an urgent need to analyse the models from a structural point of view based on quantitative model comparisons under well defined conditions.

TI  - High Site Index Drives the Soil Microbial Network Complexity and Function in Chinese Fir Mixed Plantations After Near-Natural Transformation
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The site index (SI), an important indicator of forest health, has been well-documented due to its impact on tree growth. Soil microorganisms, as decomposers that control nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems, usually respond significantly to changes in site index. However, most of the existing studies have focused on the direct effects of SI on tree growth, while the response mechanism of the microbial community network and its function has rarely been explored. In view of this, this study investigated the co-occurrence network and function of soil microbial communities under different site index (SI-14.96, SI-15.70, and SI-16.90) and soil depths (0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm) within a mixed Chinese fir plantation. The increase of site index significantly improved the soil physical and chemical properties of the Chinese fir plantation, including total phosphorus, total nitrogen, exchangeable magnesium, and soil water content. Dominant bacterial communities included Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Proteobacteria, while Ascomycota and Basidiomycota dominated the fungal community. The variation in bacterial community structure was mainly driven by soil depth (R 2 = 37.33%), while the fungal community structure was influenced primarily by the site index (R 2 = 20.80%). Soil phosphorus, organic carbon, and soil water content drove microbial community variation. In the relatively high site index, the topological properties of the bacterial and fungal co-occurrence network, including nodes, edges, and the average clustering coefficient, reached the highest, showing the highest network complexity, and the keystone taxa were more abundant in the surface soil. Functional annotation analysis further indicated that bacterial functions related to nitrogen cycling and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were both significantly highest at SI-16.90. In general, a relatively high site index (SI-16.90) for Chinese fir plantations can improve the complexity of the soil microbial network, enhance the abundance of keystone taxa, and optimize the nitrogen cycle and the function of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These findings are of great significance to the shaping of soil microbial diversity and ecological functions and provide a practical basis for improving soil ecology with a high site index in forest management.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics of dissolved organic matter in Asia's longest river: Linking isotopes, land use, and anthropogenic impacts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Large river basins integrate the three major ecosystems of atmosphere, land, and oceans, serving as crucial mediators in the global carbon cycle. Nevertheless, pronounced variations occur in geographic locations, climatic conditions, land-use patterns, and anthropogenic activities across sub-catchments of these large basins. As a result, systematic investigations into the spatial heterogeneity of dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, abundance, and their driving factors are still lacking. In this study, we combined Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-vis), excitationemission matrix spectroscopy (EEM), and water isotopes (delta 2H-H2O and delta 18O-H2O) to investigate DOM characteristics across sub-catchments of Asia's longest river (Yangtze River). The results demonstrated that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the Yangtze River is relatively low (mean: 3.17 +/- 0.95 mg L-1) compared with global major rivers. The predominance of humic-like and lignin-like components in DOM across all subcatchments highlights the dominance of allochthonous DOM sources. Notably, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration peaked in the Poyang Lake (PYL) catchment. Meanwhile, the Yangtze River mainstem (YRM) catchment, featuring extensive spatial coverage and complex environmental dynamics, showed substantial variability in DOM optical and molecular characteristics. Among sub-catchments, the Jialing River (JLR) exhibited the highest proportion of humic-like compositions (C1+C3), suggesting DOM originating primarily from forest-derived macromolecules and soil organic matter. Conversely, the Taihu Lake Catchment (THL) catchment displayed elevated abundance of protein-like components (C2) and lipid/aminoglycan-related compounds, indicative of significant contributions from autochthonous organic matter associated with eutrophication driven by intensive anthropogenic activities. These findings underscore that terrestrial carbon inputs constitute a pivotal component of riverine carbon cycling.

TI  - Influence of thinning on carbon storage mediated by soil physicochemical properties and microbial community composition in large Chinese fir timber plantation
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - BackgroundThinning practices are useful measures in forest management and play an essential role in maintaining ecological stability. However, the effects of thinning on the soil properties and microbial community in large Chinese fir timber plantations remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in soil physicochemical properties and microbial community composition in topsoil (0-20 cm) under six different intensities (i.e., 300 (R300), 450 (R450), 600 (R600), 750 (R750) and 900 (R900) trees per hectare and 1650 (R1650) as a control) in a large Chinese fir timber plantation.ResultsCompared with the CK treatment, thinning significantly altered the contents of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its fractions but not in a linear fashion; these indicators were highest in R900. In addition, thinning did not significantly affect the soil microbial community diversity indices but significantly affected the relative abundance of the core microbial community. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla; the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were highest in R900, and that of Actinobacteria was lowest in R900. The dominant fungal phyla were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mucoromycota; the relative abundance of Ascomycota was lowest in R900, and that of Mucoromycota was highest in R900. The fungal microbial community composition was more sensitive than the bacterial community composition. The activity of the carbon-cycling genes was not linearly correlated with thinning, and the abundance of C-cycle genes was highest in R900.ConclusionsThese findings are important because they show that SOC and its fractions and the abundance of the soil microorganism community in large Chinese fir timber plantations can be significantly altered by thinning, thus affecting the capacity for carbon storage. These results may advance our understanding of how the density of large timber plantations could be modified to promote soil carbon storage.

TI  - Understory species composition mediates soil greenhouse gas fluxes by affecting bacterial community diversity in boreal forests
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionPlant species composition in forest ecosystems can alter soil greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets by affecting soil properties and microbial communities. However, little attention has been paid to the forest types characterized by understory vegetation, especially in boreal forests where understory species contribute significantly to carbon and nitrogen cycling. MethodIn the present study, soil GHG fluxes, soil properties and bacterial community, and soil environmental conditions were investigated among three types of larch forest [Rhododendron simsii-Larix gmelinii forest (RL), Ledum palustre-Larix gmelinii forest (LL), and Sphagnum-Bryum-Ledum palustre-Larix gmelinii forest (SLL)] in the typical boreal region of northeast China to explore whether the forest types characterized by different understory species can affect soil GHG fluxes. ResultsThe results showed that differences in understory species significantly affected soil GHG fluxes, properties, and bacterial composition among types of larch forest. Soil CO2 and N2O fluxes were significantly higher in LL (347.12 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 20.71 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and RL (335.54 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 20.73 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) than that in SLL (295.58 mg m(-2) h(-1) and 17.65 mu g m(-2) h(-1)), while lower soil CH4 uptake (-21.07 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) were found in SLL than in RL (-35.21 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and LL (-35.85 mu g m(-2) h(-1)). No significant differences between LL and RL were found in soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes. Soil bacterial composition was mainly dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi among the three types of larch forest, while their abundances differed significantly. Soil environmental variables, soil properties, bacterial composition, and their interactions significantly affected the variations in GHG fluxes with understory species. Specifically, structural equation modeling suggested that soil bacterial composition and temperature had direct close links with variations in soil GHG fluxes among types of larch forest. Moreover, soil NO3--N and NH4+ - N content also affected soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes indirectly, via their effects on soil bacterial composition. DiscussionOur study highlights the importance of understory species in regulating soil GHG fluxes in boreal forests, which furthers our understanding of the role of boreal forests in sustainable development and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Enhancing bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soil by sophorolipids-modified biochar: Combined metagenomic and metabolomic analyses
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In this study, sophorolipids (SLs)-modified biochar (BC-SLs) was used to enhance the bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) contaminated soil. The biodegradation rate of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) by BCSLs and BC treatments were 62.86 % and 52.64 % after 60 days of remediation experiments, respectively, higher than non-biochar treatment group (24.09 %). The metagenomic analysis showed that the abundance of petroleum-degrading bacteria Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were increased by 3.8 % and 5.3 %, respectively in BC-SLs treatment, and the abundance of functional genes for PHs degradation, such as alkB, nidA and pcaG, were significantly increased by 12.85 %, 30.08 % and 21.01 %, respectively. The metabolomic analysis showed that BC-SLs facilitated the metabolic process of PHs, the microbial metabolism of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHs) became more active. Fatty acid degradation and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degradation were up- regulated, indicating the promoting effect of the BC-SLs for PHs metabolism. The combined metagenomic and metabolomic analysis demonstrated the strong positive correlations between PHs metabolites and PHs-degrading bacteria, such as lauric acid vs. Actinobacteria, benzoic vs. Proteobacteria. . The strong positive correlationsbetween PHs metabolites and PHs-degrading genes were also observed, such as o-ehyltoluene vs. nahD, , 4-isopropylbenzoic acid vs. etbAa. . The modification of biochar with SLs increased the oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of biochar. Meanwhile, the emulsification and solubilization of SLs promoted the bioavailability of PHs. The effects of BC-SLs on the nitrogen cycle during PHs remediation showed that it facilitated the accumulation of nitrogen-fixing genes, promoted nitrification but inhibited denitrification process. This study confirms that the application of BC-SLs is an effective remediation of PHs contamination and a sustainable method for controlling agricultural waste resources.

TI  - Effects of LDPE and PBAT plastics on soil organic carbon and carbon-enzymes: A mesocosm experiment under field conditions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Although the effects of plastic residues on soil organic carbon (SOC) have been studied, variations in SOC and soil carbon-enzyme activities at different plant growth stages have been largely overlooked. There remains a knowledge gap on how various varieties of plastics affect SOC and carbon-enzyme activity dynamics during the different growing stages of plants. In this study, we conducted a mesocosm experiment under field conditions using low-density polyethylene and poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) debris (LDPE-D and PBAT-D, 500-2000 mu m (pieces), 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%), and low-density polyethylene microplastics (LDPE-M, 500-1000 mu m (powder), 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%) to investigate SOC and C-enzyme activities (beta-xylosidase, cellobiohydrolase, beta-glucosidase) at the sowing, seedling, flowering and harvesting stages of soybean ( Glycine Max ). The results showed that SOC in the LDPE-D treatments significantly increased from the flowering to harvesting stage, by 12.69%-13.26% (p p < 0.05), but significantly decreased in the 0.05% and 0.1% LDPE-M treatments from the sowing to seedling stage (p p < 0.05). However, PBAT-D had no significant effect on SOC during the whole growing period. For C-enzyme activities, only LDPE-D treatments inhibited GH (17.22-38.56%), BG (46.7-66.53%) and CBH (13.19-23.16%), compared to treatment without plastic addition, from the flowering stage to harvesting stage. Meanwhile, C-enzyme activities and SOC responded non- monotonically to plastic abundance and the impacts significantly varied among the growing stages, especially in treatments with PBAT-D (p p < 0.05). These risks to soil organic carbon cycling are likely mediated by the effects of plastic contamination and degradation soil microbe. These effects are sensitive to plastic characteristics such as type, size, and shape, which, in turn, affect the biogeochemical and mechanical interactions involving plastic particles. Therefore, further research on the interactions between plastic degradation processes and the soil microbial community may provide better mechanistic understanding the effect of plastic contamination on soil organic carbon cycling.

TI  - Effect of termite mounds on soil microbial communities and microbial processes: Implications for soil carbon and nitrogen cycling
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Fungus-feeding termites are considered to be ecosystem engineers because of their ability to construct massive and complex mounds with different soil physicochemical and biological properties in tropical ecosystems. However, the impact of the termite nesting process on soil microbial communities and microbial functions related to nutrient cycling is poorly understood. In this study, we investigated termite-induced changes in soil microbial communities and their nutrient cycling functions within termite mounds (i.e. live mounds and abandoned mounds) in the humid tropical region of Southwest China. We found that the live mounds harbour intermediate microbial community richness (i.e. PLFAs, fungi, bacteria, G+, and G-bacteria) between sur-rounding topsoils and deep soils, with the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F:B) in mounds being significantly higher than in surrounding soils. However, the microbial communities gradually transformed to resemble the sur-rounding soils after the mounds were abandoned because of natural weathering and plant invasion. A relatively more uniform distribution of microbial communities was found within live mounds than in abandoned mounds and surrounding soils, suggesting that termites shaped the environment within the mounds, leading to the ho-mogenisation of microbial communities. In addition, the termite-induced changes of soil physicochemical properties (e.g. water content, pH, organic matter, total N and P) were closely linked to microbial communities. We also observed a reduction in microbial processes associated with nutrient cycling, including microbial respiration, and extracellular enzymatic activities, in mounds relative to the surrounding topsoils. These findings have important implications for exploring microbial communities within termite mounds, which is critical to understand the potential role of termites in regulating soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in tropical ecosystems.

TI  - Patterns in Wetland Microbial Community Composition and Functional Gene Repertoire Associated with Methane Emissions
T2  - MBIO
AB  - Wetland restoration on peat islands previously drained for agriculture has potential to reverse land subsidence and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide as peat accretes. However, the emission of methane could potentially offset the greenhouse gas benefits of captured carbon. As microbial communities play a key role in governing wetland greenhouse gas fluxes, we are interested in how microbial community composition and functions are associated with wetland hydrology, biogeochemistry, and methane emission, which is critical to modeling the microbial component in wetland methane fluxes and to managing restoration projects for maximal carbon sequestration. Here, we couple sequence-based methods with biogeochemical and greenhouse gas measurements to interrogate microbial communities from a pilot-scale restored wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, revealing considerable spatial heterogeneity even within this relatively small site. A number of microbial populations and functions showed strong correlations with electron acceptor availability and methane production; some also showed a preference for association with plant roots. Marker gene phylogenies revealed a diversity of major methane-producing and -consuming populations and suggested novel diversity within methanotrophs. Methanogenic archaea were observed in all samples, as were nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria, indicating that no single terminal electron acceptor was preferred despite differences in energetic favorability and suggesting spatial microheterogeneity and microniches. Notably, methanogens were negatively correlated with nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria and were most abundant at sampling sites with high peat accretion and low electron acceptor availability, where methane production was highest.
   IMPORTANCE Wetlands are the largest nonanthropogenic source of atmospheric methane but also a key global carbon reservoir. Characterizing belowground microbial communities that mediate carbon cycling in wetlands is critical to accurately predicting their responses to changes in land management and climate. Here, we studied a restored wetland and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemistry, methane production, and microbial communities, largely associated with the wetland hydraulic design. We observed patterns in microbial community composition and functions correlated with biogeochemistry and methane production, including diverse microorganisms involved in methane production and consumption. We found that methanogenesis gene abundance is inversely correlated with genes from pathways exploiting other electron acceptors, yet the ubiquitous presence of genes from all these pathways suggests that diverse electron acceptors contribute to the energetic balance of the ecosystem. These investigations represent an important step toward effective management of wetlands to reduce methane flux to the atmosphere and enhance belowground carbon storage.

TI  - Spatial patterns of global-scale forest root-shoot ratio and their controlling factors
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The forest root-shoot ratio (R/S), i.e., the ratio of belowground to aboveground biomass at the stand level, is widely used in global and regional forest carbon stock estimation and in modeling of the forest carbon cycle. Despite recent advances in understanding forest R/S variations at the individual-tree level, spatial patterns of standlevel forest R/S ratio across the globe and their driving factors remain relatively unknown. Here, we compiled and analyzed an extensive dataset from 873 forest sites worldwide, analyzed and quantified the effects of major environmental and forest growth-related variables on the stand-level R/S ratio. Based on this analysis, we further mapped the spatial pattern of the global forest R/S ratio. Our results show that, globally, variations on the stand-level forest R/S ratio are largely affected by canopy height, latitude, climatic water deficit, forest type and regeneration method, which collectively explain 37% of the variations in R/S ratio. In addition, our results suggest significant intercontinental and national variations in forest R/S ratio. At the continental scale, forest R/S ratio is highest in Oceania and lowest in South America. At the national scale, Australia has the highest forest R/S ratio while Russia has the lowest values. The forest R/S ratio is generally lower in moist tropical regions, but increases when moving to the extra-tropics when seasonality in precipitation increases. The R/S ratio in temperate and boreal regions shows prominent spatial features regulated by forest species composition and regeneration method. We conclude that future changes in environmental, biotic and anthropogenic factors, such as increased climatic water deficit and forest management, might influence the forest R/S ratio, with implications for the global and regional land carbon cycle.

TI  - Variations and controlling factors of soil denitrification rate
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The denitrification process profoundly affects soil nitrogen (N) availability and generates its byproduct, nitrous oxide, as a potent greenhouse gas. There are large uncertainties in predicting global denitrification because its controlling factors remain elusive. In this study, we compiled 4301 observations of denitrification rates across a variety of terrestrial ecosystems from 214 papers published in the literature. The averaged denitrification rate was 3516.3 +/- 91.1 mu g N kg(-1) soil day(-1). The highest denitrification rate was 4242.3 +/- 152.3 mu g N kg(-1) soil day(-1) under humid subtropical climates, and the lowest was 965.8 +/- 150.4 mu g N kg(-1) under dry climates. The denitrification rate increased with temperature, precipitation, soil carbon and N contents, as well as microbial biomass carbon and N, but decreased with soil clay contents. The variables related to soil N contents (e.g., nitrate, ammonium, and total N) explained the variation of denitrification more than climatic and edaphic variables (e.g., mean annual temperature (MAT), soil moisture, soil pH, and clay content) according to structural equation models. Soil microbial biomass carbon, which was influenced by soil nitrate, ammonium, and total N, also strongly influenced denitrification at a global scale. Collectively, soil N contents, microbial biomass, pH, texture, moisture, and MAT accounted for 60% of the variation in global denitrification rates. The findings suggest that soil N contents and microbial biomass are strong predictors of denitrification at the global scale.

TI  - Microbial diversity drives carbon use efficiency in a model soil
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Empirical evidence for the response of soil carbon cycling to the combined effects of warming, drought and diversity loss is scarce. Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) plays a central role in regulating the flow of carbon through soil, yet how biotic and abiotic factors interact to drive it remains unclear. Here, we combine distinct community inocula (a biotic factor) with different temperature and moisture conditions (abiotic factors) to manipulate microbial diversity and community structure within a model soil. While community composition and diversity are the strongest predictors of CUE, abiotic factors modulated the relationship between diversity and CUE, with CUE being positively correlated with bacterial diversity only under high moisture. Altogether these results indicate that the diversity x ecosystem-function relationship can be impaired under non-favorable conditions in soils, and that to understand changes in soil C cycling we need to account for the multiple facets of global changes.

TI  - Long-Read Amplicon Sequencing of Nitric Oxide Dismutase (nod) Genes Reveal Diverse Oxygenic Denitrifiers in Agricultural Soils and Lake Sediments
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Microorganisms play an essential role in nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in soils and sediments. The recently discovered oxygenic denitrifiers are proposed to reduce nitrate and nitrite via nitric oxide dismutation directly to N-2 and O-2. So far, the ecological role of these microbes is not well understood. The only available tool for a targeted study of oxygenic denitrifiers is their respective maker gene, nitric oxide dismutase (nod). Here, we established the use of PacBio long-read sequencing of nod gene amplicons to study the diversity and community structure of oxygenic denitrifiers. Two distinct sets of environmental samples, agricultural soil and lake sediment, were investigated as examples. The circular consensus sequences (ca 1.0 kb) obtained covered most substitution characteristic of NO dismutase and allowed for reliable classification of oxygenic denitrifiers. Distinct nod gene pools and community structure were revealed for the different habitats, with most sequence types affiliated to yet unidentified environmental nod lineages. The abundance of nod genes ranged 2.2 x 10(6)-3.2 x 10(7) gene copies g(-1) soil or sediment, accounting for up to 3% of total bacterial 16S rRNA gene counts. This study indicates that nod-gene-targeted long-read sequencing can be a powerful tool for studying the ecology of these novel microbes, and the results also suggest that oxygenic denitrifiers are prevalent and abundant in different terrestrial samples, where they could play an important, but yet overlooked role in nitrogen transformations.

TI  - Effects of interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria on the growth of Lotus corniculatus L.: From the perspective of regulating rhizosphere fungal community
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) provide essential nutrients to crops and are affected by fertilizers. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB), nitrogen -fixing bacteria (NFB), and AMF have mutually beneficial relationships with plants, but the effects of their interactions on plant growth by regulating rhizosphere fungal community have not been sufficiently studied. In this study, a greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to investigate the interactions between AMF and bacteria (PSB and NFB) on the growth of Lotus corniculatus L. Specifically, the role of rhizosphere fungal community in the growth of Lotus corniculatus L. was explored using Illumina MiSeq high -throughput sequencing. The results showed that combined inoculation of AMF with PSB and NFB increased plant biomass, plant height, and fungal colonization rate. The richness, complexity, and stability of rhizosphere fungal community also increased after combined inoculation of AMF with PSB and/or NFB, particularly with PSB. In addition, combined inoculation of AMF with PSB and NFB enriched the abundance of beneficial microorganisms, with Chaetomium and Humicola showing the greatest alterations. The structural equation model showed that the interactions of AMF with PSB and NFB promoted plant growth by affecting fungal network structure and soil enzyme activities involved in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling. These findings provide evidence for the effects of interactions of AMF with PSB and NFB on rhizosphere fungal community and plant growth.

TI  - Grazers and soil moisture determine the fate of added 15NH4 + in Yellowstone grasslands
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - The influence of ungulate grazers on nutrient cycling and ecosystem productivity in grasslands has been shown to differ with moisture, nutrient availability, and feedbacks between above- and belowground activities. We examined the movement of nitrogen (N), applied as ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4, through both dry and mesic sites in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park to test the hypothesis that plants were more able to acquire added N in grazed relative to ungrazed sites. Previous studies showed enhanced N mineralization in grazed areas, and detritus removal by grazers was predicted to enhance early-season plant growth. Thirteen months after tracer addition, there were no differences in plant N-15 as a function of grazing, but historically ungrazed sites retained more N-15 in accumulated litter than at grazed sites. This result demonstrated the importance of detritus in regulating redistribution of incoming N and the role of grazers in this process. Site moisture status influenced N-15 recovery in all pools-soils, microbial biomass, and plants-and greater plant N-15 acquisition occurred in roots at dry relative to mesic sites. Understanding how grazers influence nutrient cycling at the landscape scale requires further investigation of interactions among soil moisture, plant production, litter accumulation, grazing intensity, and belowground processes.

CP  - 10th Annual Nitrogen Cycle Meeting
AB  - The ability to respire nitrate when oxygen is limited has been described in taxonomically diverse microorganisms including members of the alpha-, beta-, gamma- and epsilon-proteobacteria, high and low GC Gram-positive bacteria and even Archaea. Respiratory nitrate reduction is the first step of the denitrification pathway, which is important since it is the main biological process responsible for the return of fixed nitrogen to the atmosphere, thus completing the nitrogen cycle. During the last decade, considerable knowledge has been accumulated on the biochemistry and genetics of the nitrate reductases. In this paper, we summarize the recent progress in molecular approaches for studying the ecology of the nitrate-reducing community in the environment.

TI  - Shotgun metagenomics reveals distinct functional diversity and metabolic capabilities between 12 000-year- old permafrost and active layers on Muot da Barba Peider (Swiss Alps)
T2  - MICROBIAL GENOMICS
AB  - The warming-induced thawing of permafrost promotes microbial activity, often resulting in enhanced greenhouse gas emissions. The ability of permafrost microorganisms to survive the in situ sub-zero temperatures, their energetic strategies and their metabolic versatility in using soil organic materials determine their growth and functionality upon thawing. Hence, functional characterization of the permafrost microbiome, particularly in the underexplored mid-latitudinal alpine regions, is a crucial first step in predicting its responses to the changing climate, and the consequences for soil-climate feedbacks. In this study, for the first time, the functional potential and metabolic capabilities of a temperate mountain permafrost microbiome from central Europe has been analysed using shotgun metagenomics. Permafrost and active layers from the summit of Muot da Barba Peider (MBP) [Swiss Alps, 2979 m above sea level (a.s.l.)] revealed a strikingly high functional diversity in the permafrost (north-facing soils at a depth of 160 cm). Permafrost metagenomes were enriched in stress-response genes (e.g. cold-shock genes, chaperones), as well as in genes involved in cell defence and competition (e.g. antiviral proteins, antibiotics, motility, nutrient-uptake ABC transporters), compared with active-layer metagenomes. Permafrost also showed a higher potential for the synthesis of carbohydrate-active enzymes, and an overrepresentation of genes involved in fermentation, carbon fixation, denitrification and nitrogen reduction reactions. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential capabilities of permafrost microorganisms to thrive in cold and oligotrophic conditions, and highlight their metabolic versatility in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Our study provides a first insight into the high functional gene diversity of the central European mountain permafrost microbiome. Our findings extend our understanding of the microbial ecology of permafrost and represent a baseline for future investigations comparing the functional profiles of permafrost microbial communities at different latitudes.

CP  - Seminar of the Nordic-Agricultural-Researchers-Union
AB  - The observed and projected increase in emission of greenhouse gases, with attendant effects on global warming and sea level rise, have raised interests in identifying mitigation options. Terrestrial C sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Land use, vegetation and soil management have a strong impact on the biotic processes of C sequestration. Losses of C from the terrestrial ecosystems are exacerbated by deforestation, biomass burning, plowing, resource-based and subsistence agriculture, and practices that mine soil fertility and deplete the soil organic C (SOC) pool. Biomass burning may also produce charcoal, which is an inert carbon with long residence time. Practices that enhance C sequestration include afforestation and reforestation, conservation tillage and mulch farming, integrated nutrient management and adopting systems with high biodiversity. Net C sequestration within an ecosystem can be assessed by taking into account the hidden C costs of fertilizers, pesticides, tillage, irrigation and other input. Restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems has a vast potential of C sequestration. The Kyoto Protocol provides for C sequestration in terrestrial sinks and C trading through Clean Development Mechanisms. Terrestrial C sequestration, besides being a win-win strategy, offers a window of opportunity for the first few decades of the 21(st) century. It is a natural process of reducing the rates of gaseous emissions while alternatives to fossil fuel take effect.

TI  - Impact of vegetation community on litter decomposition: Evidence from a reciprocal transplant study with 13C labeled plant litter
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Litter decomposition has been highlighted as one of the crucial biochemical carbon sequestration processes in grassland ecosystems. Vegetation changes of grasslands are associated with an alteration of litter quality and decomposer communities. How they affect litter decomposition and associated carbon flows at the plant-soil interface, is not well understood. We designed a reciprocal transplant litter experiment by incubating C-13-labeled litter in selected patches. The primary aim of this study was to (1) determine the relative effects of litter quality and soil microbial community on litter decomposition rates; (2) estimate the associated carbon incorporated into different groups of the soil microbial community; and (3) verify if the dominant litter decomposed faster at "home" sites, i.e. home-field advantage (HFA) effect. Our data indicated that the interaction between litter type and decomposition site significantly affected litter decomposition. Cellulose contributed the most C during decomposition, and fungal phospholipid fatty acids incorporated the highest level of C-13 from labeled litter. There was a higher decomposition rate of cellulose and more C-13 incorporation in fungi, when each type of litter was incubated in its dominated sites. HFA index presented positive values that illustrates that the dominant litter had advantage in mediating decomposition processes. Gram positive (GP) bacteria and actinomycetes, they were found to be closely associated with the C priming of native-SOM. From this perspective of HFA, our results help understanding mechanisms of leaf litter soil feedbacks in grassland, including the return of carbon (C) to the soil through litter decomposition and fraction in functional microbial groups. Practically, the results also imply that a higher biodiversity of grassland will affect the carbon cycle and formation of soil organic matter in ecosystem. Once such litter-soil feedbacks process is considered, vegetation management in grassland will contribute to carbon cycle, formation of soil organic matter in ecosystem.

TI  - Remediation of Crude Oil-Polluted Soil by the Bacterial Rhizosphere Community of Suaeda Salsa Revealed by 16S rRNA Genes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Crude oil pollution of soil is a serious environmental issue, and bioremediation using plants and microorganisms is a natural and sustainable method for its restoration. Pot incubation of a two-factor randomized block (plants with two levels, and crude oil with three levels) was designed to investigate the rhizosphere bacterial community of Suaeda salsa (L.) Pall. Crude oil contamination of soil was studied at different levels: 2 g/kg (low), 4 g/kg (medium), and 6 g/kg (high) levels. In this study, the physicochemical properties of the collected rhizosphere soil were analyzed. Moreover, the soil bacteria were further identified using the 16S rRNA gene. The effects of S. salsa and crude oil and their interaction on the physiochemical properties of the soil and crude oil degradation were found to be significant. Crude oil significantly influenced the diversity and evenness of bacteria, while the effects of S. salsa and interaction with crude oil were not significant. Proteobacteria were found to be dominant at the phylum level. Meanwhile, at the genera level, Saccharibacteria and Alcanivorax increased significantly in the low and medium contamination treatment groups with S. salsa, whereas Saccharibacteria and Desulfuromonas were prevalent in the high contamination treatment group. High crude oil contamination led to a significant decrease in the bacterial diversity in soil, while the effects of S. salsa and its interaction were not significant. Despite the highest abundance of crude oil degradation bacteria, S. salsa reduced crude oil degradation bacteria and increased bacteria related to sulfur, phosphorus, and nitrogen cycling in the low and high contamination group, whereas the opposite effect was observed for the medium contamination treatment group. The abundance of most crude oil degradation bacteria is negatively correlated with crude oil content. Nitrogen cycling bacteria are sensitive to the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen, and pH of the soil. Sulfur cycling bacteria are sensitive to aromatic hydrocarbons, saturated hydrocarbons, and asphaltene in soil. This research is helpful for further studying the mechanism of synergistic degradation by S. salsa and bacteria.

TI  - Mycelia-derived C contributes more to nitrogen cycling than root-derived C in ectomycorrhizal alpine forests
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Plant roots and their associated microbial symbionts impact carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in ecosystems, but estimates of the relative contributions of root- versus microbe-derived dynamic inputs are highly uncertain. Roots release C into soil via exudation and turnover (i.e., root-derived C), but also by allocating C to mycorrhizal fungal mycelia, which exude C and undergo turnover (i.e., mycelia-derived C). Given that the relative contributions of root- and mycelia-derived C inputs are unknown, a key knowledge gap lies in understanding not only the relative contributions of root- versus mycelia-derived C inputs, but also the consequences of these fluxes on nutrient cycling.
   Using ingrowth cores and stable isotope analyses, we quantified root- and mycelia-derived C inputs into the soil and their relative contributions to nitrogen (N) cycling in two ectomycorrhizal alpine forests, a 70-year-old spruce plantation and a 200-year-old spruce-fir dominated forest, in western Sichuan, China.
   Across the two forests, extramatrical mycelia of ectomycorrhizal fungi accounted for up to two-thirds of the new root C inputs into soil and similar to 80% of the stimulated N mineralization. Moreover, flux-specific (per gram) mycelia-derived C inputs stimulated multiple indices of soil N cycling to a greater degree than the flux-specific root-derived C inputs, accounting for similar to 70% of the stimulated N mineralization in both forests.
   Collectively, our findings indicate that the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on soil C and N cycling may exceed those of roots in alpine coniferous forests dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi, highlighting the need to incorporate mycorrhizal fungal inputs into biogeochemical models for ecosystems.

TI  - Size effects of microplastics on competition between crop and weed via soil microbes
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are widespread contaminants in agroecosystems, with potential implications for soil microbial communities, plant growth, and crop-weed interactions. This study investigates how MPs of different particle sizes influence crop-weed competition by altering soil microbial communities. Through a controlled greenhouse experiment, we examined the effects of 50 mu m and 500 mu m polyethylene (PE) MPs on competition between Eruca sativa (crop) and Amaranthus retroflexus (weed). We specifically analyzed shifts in bacterial and fungal community composition, microbial functional groups, and interkingdom microbial networks. Our results indicate that MPs negatively affect plant growth, with larger MPs (500 mu m) increasing the competitive advantage of weeds over crops. MPs also alter soil microbial dynamics, leading to a shift in bacterial-fungal interactions from bacterial to fungal dominance with increasing PE particle size. Specifically, smaller MPs (50 mu m) promoted bacterial functional groups associated with carbon cycling, whereas larger MPs increased the relative abundance of fungal plant pathogens. Additionally, larger MPs significantly reduced crop biomass, likely due to nutrient cycling disruptions and increased pathogen pressure, ultimately favoring weed competitiveness. This study provides new insights into how MPs pollution influences soil microbial dynamics and crop-weed interactions in agroecosystems.

TI  - Comparative microbial community composition from secondary carbonate (moonmilk) deposits: implications for the Cansiliella servadeii cave hygropetric food web
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPELEOLOGY
AB  - The microbial diversity of moonmilk, a hydrated calcium carbonate speleothem, was evaluated from two Italian caves to provide context for the food web of highly-specialized troglobitic beetles, Cansiliella spp. (Leptodirinae), with distinctive carbon and nitrogen isotope values indicative of a novel food source. The moonmilk and associated percolating waters had low to no extractable chlorophyll, with an average organic C:N ratio of 9, indicating limited allochthonous input and a significant contribution from microbial biomass. The biomass from moonmilk was estimated to be similar to 10(4) micro- and meiofaunal individuals per m(2) and similar to 10(7) microbial cells/ml. Proteobacteria dominated the 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from the moonmilk from both caves. The distribution of other proteobacterial classes and phyla in the moonmilk were statistically similar to each other, even though the two caves are geographically separated from each other. Comparing the moonmilk gene sequences to sequences from previously described environmental clones or cultured strains revealed the uniqueness of the moonmilk habitat, as similar to 15% of all of the moonmilk sequences were more closely related to each other than to sequences retrieved from any other habitat. However, comparative analyses confirmed that as much as similar to 34% of the clones sequences were also closely related to environmental clones and cultured strains derived from soil and freshwater habitats, which is likely due to the fact that the putative inoculation source for the moonmilk bacterial communities is from overlying soil and percolating fluids from the surface. Prior to our studies of Cansiliella spp., moonmilk has not been considered a food source for cave animals. Our findings provide unique insight into moonmilk microbial diversity that could reveal the underpinnings of the moonmilk carbon and nitrogen cycle that influences the isotopic composition and the morphological adaptations of the troglobitic beetles associated with the moonmilk.

TI  - Organic amendments promote soil phosphorus related functional genes and microbial phosphorus cycling
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Phosphorus (P) mobilization by soil microorganisms plays a crucial role in determining the fertility and productivity of terrestrial ecosystems, yet the synthesis of impact of fertilization strategies on this process remains poorly understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 1082 observations from 85 independent fertilization experiments to evaluate how the abundance and diversity of P related functional genes (phoD, phoC and pqqC) and microbial P cycling responded to fertilizer addition. Overall, we found that amendment with organic matter (OM) alone or with inorganic fertilizer (OM + IF) enhanced soil microbial P (MBP), soil phosphatase activity, and the phoD gene abundance. Conversely, addition of nitrogen (N) fertilizer increased pqqC gene abundance but decreased MBP and phoD gene abundance. P fertilizer increased MBP and the diversity of the phoD gene, while combined NP addition (with or without potassium, K) increased acid phosphatase activity, MBP, pqqC gene abundance and the diversity of the phoC gene. Specifically, the effects of fertilizer addition on rhizosphere properties varied with fertilizer type: OM increased rhizosphere phosphatase activity and phoD gene abundance, whereas P and NP(K) fertilizers decreased them. Furthermore, as annual temperature and precipitation increased, the influence of OM on soil phosphatase activity and phoD gene abundance increased, while the effect of P addition on the Chao1 index of phoD reduced. As experimental duration lengthens, the effect of OM on phoD gene abundance was strengthened, while the effect of N addition was suppressed. Across all fertilizer studies, structural equation models suggested that soil phosphatase activity was closely correlated with soil organic carbon (SOC), soil pH, and phoD or phoC gene abundance. This comprehensive analysis highlights the benefits of OM and OM + IF over synthetic fertilizer for soil microbial P cycling and associated functional genes, providing profound insights into P mobilization and use efficiency in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - The role of oxygen in stimulating methane production in wetlands
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, is the second most important greenhouse gas contributor to climate change after carbon dioxide (CO2). The biological emissions of CH4 from wetlands are a major uncertainty in CH4 budgets. Microbial methanogenesis by Archaea is an anaerobic process accounting for most biological CH4 production in nature, yet recent observations indicate that large emissions can originate from oxygenated or frequently oxygenated wetland soil layers. To determine how oxygen (O-2) can stimulate CH4 emissions, we used incubations of Sphagnum peat to demonstrate that the temporary exposure of peat to O-2 can increase CH4 yields up to 2000-fold during subsequent anoxic conditions relative to peat without O-2 exposure. Geochemical (including ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, X-ray absorbance spectroscopy) and microbiome (16S rDNA amplicons, metagenomics) analyses of peat showed that higher CH4 yields of redox-oscillated peat were due to functional shifts in the peat microbiome arising during redox oscillation that enhanced peat carbon (C) degradation. Novosphingobium species with O-2-dependent aromatic oxygenase genes increased greatly in relative abundance during the oxygenation period in redox-oscillated peat compared to anoxic controls. Acidobacteria species were particularly important for anaerobic processing of peat C, including in the production of methanogenic substrates H-2 and CO2. Higher CO2 production during the anoxic phase of redox-oscillated peat stimulated hydrogenotrophic CH4 production by Methanobacterium species. The persistence of reduced iron (Fe(II)) during prolonged oxygenation in redox-oscillated peat may further enhance C degradation through abiotic mechanisms (e.g., Fenton reactions). The results indicate that specific functional shifts in the peat microbiome underlie O-2 enhancement of CH4 production in acidic, Sphagnum-rich wetland soils. They also imply that understanding microbial dynamics spanning temporal and spatial redox transitions in peatlands is critical for constraining CH4 budgets; predicting feedbacks between climate change, hydrologic variability, and wetland CH4 emissions; and guiding wetland C management strategies.

TI  - Micro-fractionation shows microbial community changes in soil particles below 20 μm
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - IntroductionMicro-scale analysis of microbes in soil is essential to the overall understanding of microbial organization, interactions, and ecosystem functioning. Soil fractionation according to its aggregated structure has been used to access microbial habitats. While bacterial communities have been extensively described, little is known about the fungal communities at scales relevant to microbial interactions. MethodsWe applied a gentle soil fractionation method to preserve stable aggregated structures within the range of micro-aggregates and studied fungal and bacterial communities as well as nitrogen cycling potentials in the pristine Rothamsted Park Grass soil (bulk soil) as well as in its particle size fractions (PSFs; >250 mu m, 250-63 mu m, 63-20 mu m, 20-2 mu m, <2 mu m, and supernatant). ResultsOverall bacterial and fungal community structures changed in PSFs below 20 mu m. The relative abundance of Basidiomycota decreased with decreasing particle size over the entire measure range, while Ascomycota showed an increase and Mucoromycota became more prominent in particles below 20 mu m. Bacterial diversity was found highest in the < 2 mu m fraction, but only a few taxa were washed-off during the procedure and found in supernatant samples. These taxa have been associated with exopolysaccharide production and biofilm formation (e.g., Pseudomonas, Massilia, Mucilaginibacter, Edaphobaculum, Duganella, Janthinobacterium, and Variovorax). The potential for nitrogen reduction was found elevated in bigger aggregates. DiscussionThe observed changes below 20 mu m particle are in line with scales where microbes operate and interact, highlighting the potential to focus on little researched sub-fractions of micro-aggregates. The applied method shows potential for use in studies focusing on the role of microbial biofilms in soil and might also be adapted to research various other soil microbial functions. Technical advances in combination with micro-sampling methods in soil promise valuable output in soil studies when particles below 20 mu m are included.

TI  - Carbon emissions from desert soil regulated by non-rainfall water inputs and their potential mechanisms
T2  - CATENA
AB  - During periods with no precipitation, desert ecosystem soils periodically absorb air moisture at night to form non-rainfall water inputs (NRWIs), while substantial carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are typically observed during midday. However, the intrinsic relationship between these periodic NRWIs and the CO2 release phenomenon remains unclear. In this study, we utilized biological soil crusts and employed in situ observation methods during the summer and fall. We also conducted humidity- and temperature-controlled experiments to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of NRWIs and temperature variations on daily soil CO2 release. We found that soil accumulated NRWIs and soil respiration rates reached their peak values at dawn and midday, respectively, with a lag of 2-4 h between the two. The accumulated NRWIs increased with the development of the crusts across different cover types, however, there was no significant difference in maximum soil respiration rate observed at noon. Notably, the significant release of CO2 at midday was eliminated when the soil NRWIs were suppressed, demonstrating that the NRWIs were the primary determinant of the substantial CO2 release at midday. Furthermore, the soil sucrase activity, dehydrogenase activity, microbial richness, and the Chao1 index of soil microorganisms were significantly higher at noon than at night, indicating that microbial activity was greater during the day compared with at night. Our results confirm that the significant midday CO2 release in desert ecosystems is like a daily "micro-Birch effect" phenomenon induced by NRWIs. This phenomenon may be due to the transition between dormancy and activation of microorganisms mediated by NRWIs. This study demonstrates that NRWIs induce consistent daily pulses of CO2 in desert ecosystems, representing a previously overlooked microbial-driven pathway. Given the extensive coverage of deserts in global terrestrial ecosystems, this mechanism may have implications for carbon cycling and budget estimates in drylands and potentially at broader scales.

TI  - Spatial and seasonal responses of diazotrophs and ammonium-oxidizing bacteria to legume-based silvopastoral systems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Legume-based silvopastoral systems drive the soil total bacterial, diazotrophic and ammonium-oxidizing bacterial communities and represent a sustainable strategy for preserving and restoring soil health. These systems increase the input of organic matter and nutrients and can drive the biodiversity and abundance of soil microorganisms, which leads to an intensification of nutrient cycling, mainly nitrogen. However, spatial and seasonal variations in the nitrogen-cycling bacterial community in soils under silvopastoral systems have not been well demonstrated. Therefore, we investigated the influence of silvopastoral systems with shrub-tree legumes on the structure, diversity, and abundance of total bacterial, diazotrophic and ammonium-oxidizing bacterial communities at different sites around the legumes in wet and dry seasons. The experimental design consisted of i) pure signalgrass (Brachiaria decumbens), ii) a silvopastoral system consisting of signalgrass intercropping with gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) and iii) signalgrass intercropping with Sabia (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia) in a randomized block design with three replications each. Samples were collected at zero (0 m), four (4 m) and eight meters (8 m) away from the legume rows and randomly in pure signalgrass. We used DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to investigate the influence of treatments on the structure, diversity, and abundance of total bacteria, diazotrophs and ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In addition, the samples were subjected to physical and chemical analysis. Soils under silvopastoral systems presented higher acidity, cation-exchange capacity (CEC) and nitrate (NO3-N) content than those of the soil under pure signalgrass cultivation. The soil community structures of total bacteria, diazotrophs and AOB were influenced by the silvopastoral system and were not similar among all distances from the legume row, particularly in the wet season. The diversity of the diazotrophic community was higher in silvopastoral systems than in pure signalgrass. There was a greater abundance of microbial communities in both silvopastoral systems, in which total bacteria and diazotrophs were more abundant in the dry season than in the wet season. Silvopastoral systems with shrub-tree legumes improved soil biological quality by promoting the abundance and spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the nitrogen-cycling bacterial community.

TI  - Mycorrhizal association as a primary control of the CO2 fertilization effect
T2  - SCIENCE
AB  - Plants buffer increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations through enhanced growth, but the question whether nitrogen availability constrains the magnitude of this ecosystem service remains unresolved. Synthesizing experiments from around the world, we show that CO2 fertilization is best explained by a simple interaction between nitrogen availability and mycorrhizal association. Plant species that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi show a strong biomass increase (30 +/- 3%, P < 0.001) in response to elevated CO2 regardless of nitrogen availability, whereas low nitrogen availability limits CO2 fertilization (0 +/- 5%, P = 0.946) in plants that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The incorporation of mycorrhizae in global carbon cyclemodels is feasible, and crucial if we are to accurately project ecosystem responses and feedbacks to climate change.

TI  - Long-term effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of silver nanoparticles on microbial biomass, enzyme activity, and functional genes involved in the nitrogen cycle of loamy soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - The increasing production and use of engineered silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in industry and private households are leading to increased concentrations of AgNP in the environment. An ecological risk assessment of AgNP is needed, but it requires understanding the long term effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of AgNP on the soil microbiome. Hence, the aim of this study was to reveal the long-term effects of AgNP on soil microorganisms. The study was conducted as a laboratory incubation experiment over a period of one year using a loamy soil and AgNP concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 1 mg AgNP/kg soil. The short term effects of AgNP were, in general, limited. However, after one year of exposure to 0.01 mg AgNP/kg, there were significant negative effects on soil microbial biomass (quantified by extractable DNA; p = 0.000) and bacterial ammonia oxidizers (quantified by amoA gene copy numbers; p = 0.009). Furthermore, the tested AgNP concentrations significantly decreased the soil microbial biomass, the leucine aminopeptidase activity (quantified by substrate turnover; p = 0.014), and the abundance of nitrogen fixing microorganisms (quantified by nifH gene copy numbers; p = 0.001). The results of the positive control with AgNO3 revealed predominantly stronger effects due to Ag+ ion release. Thus, the increasing toxicity of AgNP during the test period may reflect the long-term release of Ag+ ions. Nevertheless, even very low concentrations of AgNP caused disadvantages for the microbial soil community, especially for nitrogen cycling, and our results confirmed the risks of releasing AgNP into the environment.

TI  - Carbon cycling and balance in a traditional cardamom based agroforestry system of Sikkim Himalayas
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The pattern of carbon cycling dynamics in a 20 year old traditional cardamom agroforestry system located at Sikkim Himalaya was studied for two years to understand the dynamics of different carbon pools and carbon emission patterns in the system. Total biomass (aboveground + belowground) and carbon in trees were 81.91 +/- 9.04 Mg ha(-1)and 38.47 +/- 4.25 Mg C ha(-1), respectively and contributed 27% of the total ecosystem carbon. Herbs and detritus carbon were 2.34 +/- 0.24 Mg C ha(-1)and 3.64 +/- 0.20 Mg C ha(-1)respectively while cumulative soil organic carbon (SOC) stock ranged from 89.90 +/- 2.16 (January) to 117.91 +/- 3.12 Mg C ha(-1)(August) in the 0-45 cm soil layer. Seasonal microbial biomass carbon (MBC) stock varied from 501.34 to 857.77 mu g g(-1)while annual CO(2)emission (SR) ranged from 112.11-219.29 mg CO(2)m(-2) h(-1). SOC, MBC and SR exhibited strong seasonality with a peak value in rainy and least in the winter season. Carbon density of trees exhibited a positive and significant relation with tree density (P < 0.05), basal area (P < 0.01) and aboveground biomass (P < 0.01). All the abiotic variables with the exception of bulk density and soil pH showed strong positive and significant relationship with SOC, MBC and SR. Total carbon sequestration of 11.91 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)and release of 3.46 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)resulting to a net ecosystem carbon balance of 8.45 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)by a traditional agroforestry system suggests that besides provision of livelihood opportunities it can be used as an adaptation strategy in agricultural systems for mitigation of climate change.

TI  - Effects of maternal genotypic identity and genetic diversity of the red mangrove Rhizophora mangle on associated soil bacterial communities: A field-based experiment
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Loss of plant biodiversity can result in reduced abundance and diversity of associated species with implications for ecosystem functioning. In ecosystems low in plant species diversity, such as Neotropical mangrove forests, it is thought that genetic diversity within the dominant plant species could play an important role in shaping associated communities. Here, we used a manipulative field experiment to study the effects of maternal genotypic identity and genetic diversity of the red mangrove Rhizophora mangle on the composition and richness of associated soil bacterial communities. Using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) community fingerprinting, we found that bacterial community composition differed among R. mangle maternal genotypes but not with genetic diversity. Bacterial taxa richness, total soil nitrogen, and total soil carbon were not significantly affected by maternal genotypic identity or genetic diversity of R. mangle. Our findings show that genotype selection in reforestation projects could influence soil bacterial community composition. Further research is needed to determine what impact these bacterial community differences might have on ecosystem processes, such as carbon and nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Soil fauna: key to new carbon models
T2  - SOIL
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is key to maintaining soil fertility, mitigating climate change, combatting land degradation, and conserving above- and below-ground biodiversity and associated soil processes and ecosystem services. In order to derive management options for maintaining these essential services provided by soils, policy makers depend on robust, predictive models identifying key drivers of SOM dynamics. Existing SOM models and suggested guidelines for future SOM modelling are defined mostly in terms of plant residue quality and input and microbial decomposition, overlooking the significant regulation provided by soil fauna. The fauna controls almost any aspect of organic matter turnover, foremost by regulating the activity and functional composition of soil microorganisms and their physical-chemical connectivity with soil organic matter. We demonstrate a very strong impact of soil animals on carbon turnover, increasing or decreasing it by several dozen percent, sometimes even turning C sinks into C sources or vice versa. This is demonstrated not only for earthworms and other larger invertebrates but also for smaller fauna such as Collembola. We suggest that inclusion of soil animal activities (plant residue consumption and bioturbation altering the formation, depth, hydraulic properties and physical heterogeneity of soils) can fundamentally affect the predictive outcome of SOM models. Understanding direct and indirect impacts of soil fauna on nutrient availability, carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas emissions and plant growth is key to the understanding of SOM dynamics in the context of global carbon cycling models. We argue that explicit consideration of soil fauna is essential to make realistic modelling predictions on SOM dynamics and to detect expected non-linear responses of SOM dynamics to global change. We present a decision framework, to be further developed through the activities of KEYSOM, a European COST Action, for when mechanistic SOM models include soil fauna. The research activities of KEYSOM, such as field experiments and literature reviews, together with dialogue between empiricists and modellers, will inform how this is to be done.

TI  - Main environmental drivers of abundance, diversity and community structure of comammox Nitrospira in paddy soils
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
AB  - The recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizers comammox Nitrospira contain clades A and B that can establish an independent one-step nitrification process; however, little is known about their environmental drivers or habitat distributions in agricultural soils. Previous studies on comammox Nitrospira in paddy soils have mainly focused on small-scale samples, and there is a lack of multisite research on comammox Nitrospira in paddy soils. In this study, we conducted a survey of 36 paddy soils to understand the community structure, abundance, and diversity of comammox Nitrospira and the degree to which they are affected by environmental factors at a large scale. Comammox Nitrospira were found to be widely distributed among the paddy soils. The abundance of comammox Nitrospira clade A was mostly lower than that of clade B, whereas its diversity was mostly higher than that of clade B. Correlation analysis showed that multiple factors affected (P < 0.05) the abundance of comammox Nitrospira, including soil pH, organic matter, total carbon, and total nitrogen, latitude, mean annual temperature, and mean annual precipitation. Moreover, there was a clear relationship between the comammox Nitrospira community and habitat, indicating that some amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) had a unique dominant position in specific habitats. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ASVs of comammox Nitrospira clade A clustered with the known sequences in the paddy soils and were significantly different from the known sequences in other habitats, which may be related to the unique paddy field habitat. In contrast, comammox Nitrospira clade B showed no clear habitat dependence. These results support the wide distribution and high abundance of comammox Nitrospira in paddy soils and provide novel insights into nitrogen cycling and nutrient management in agricultural ecosystems.

TI  - Response of bacterial communities and nitrogen-cycling genes in newly reclaimed mudflat paddy soils to nitrogen fertilizer gradients
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Conversion of coastal mudflats into paddy soils is an effective measure to alleviate the pressures on land resources. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of nitrogen (N) fertilizers on bacterial communities in newly reclaimed mudflat paddy soils. We performed a field plot experiment with six N fertilizer rates (0, 210, 255, 300, 345, and 390 kg N ha(-1)) in a newly reclaimed mudflat paddy for 2 consecutive years and used Illumina sequencing and qPCR to investigate the effects of N fertilizers on bacterial communities and N-cycling genes. Results showed that high N fertilization (above 300 kg N ha(-1)) increased the contents of organic matter (OM), total N (TN), ammonium (NH4+), and nitrate (NO3-) and significantly decreased the diversity and richness of bacteria. Furthermore, high N fertilization had a stronger effect on bacterial communities than low N fertilization, probably due to high concentrations of NH4+, OM, and NO3-. Additionally, in paddy soils with high N fertilizer application, the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, gamma-proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria increased significantly, but the reverse was true for those of Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, 5-proteobacteria, alpha-proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and beta-proteobacteria. The results of qPCR indicated that high N fertilization significantly increased the relative abundance of nifH genes involved in N fixation and decreased that of amoA-archaea involved in ammonia oxidation, nirS genes involved in nitrite reduction, and nosZ genes involved in nitrous oxide reduction, which suggested that high N fertilization increased the potential of available N retention and reduced the potential of nitrous oxide emission. Overall, N fertilizers with an N fertilizer rate of above 300 kg N ha(-1) significantly altered the bacterial communities and N-cycle of mudflat paddy soils.

TI  - Earthworm functional traits and interspecific interactions affect plant nitrogen acquisition and primary production
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
CP  - 10th International Symposium on Earthworm Ecology (ISEE)
AB  - We performed a greenhouse experiment to test how the functional diversity of earthworms, the dominant group of soil macro-invertebrates in many terrestrial ecosystems, affects nitrogen cycling and plant growth. Three species were chosen to represent a range of functional traits: Lumbricus terrestris (large, mainly detritivorous, makes vertical permanent burrows open at the surface), Aporrectodea longa (medium-large, feeds on both detritus and soil, makes burrows more branched than L. terrestris), and Allolobophora chlorotica (small, geophagous, makes ephemeral burrows below the soil surface). Mesocosms with ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were inoculated with none to all three species (similar total biomass), using an experimental design (Simplex) suited to partition single species and diversity effects. Two contrasting N sources, urea or mammalian dung, were labelled with N-15 so that the acquisition by plants and earthworms and recovery of applied N-15 could be estimated.
   Over 3 months, plant production was higher with urea applications, but there were also species-specific earthworm effects: A. chlorotica and, to a lesser extent, A. longa increased shoot biomass, whereas L. terrestris increased root biomass. Earthworms did not affect soil N concentrations or leaching losses, whereas more N was leached under urea. A. chlorotica tended to increase dung-N-15 recovery in grass shoots, but in interaction with A. longa had the opposite effect, possibly through increased N immobilization in the microbial biomass. Earthworms assimilated negligible amounts of urea-N-15 but a substantial proportion (17% on average) of the dung-N-15, with no clear-cut differences between species. Our findings show that earthworm species may have similar trophic response to N sources and yet different effects on plant N uptake and primary production, and that inter-specific earthworm interactions can result in non-additive diversity effects.

TI  - Impact of fire on active layer and permafrost microbial communities and metagenomes in an upland Alaskan boreal forest
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Permafrost soils are large reservoirs of potentially labile carbon (C). Understanding the dynamics of C release from these soils requires us to account for the impact of wildfires, which are increasing in frequency as the climate changes. Boreal wildfires contribute to global emission of greenhouse gases (GHG-CO2, CH4 and N2O) and indirectly result in the thawing of near-surface permafrost. In this study, we aimed to define the impact of fire on soil microbial communities and metabolic potential for GHG fluxes in samples collected up to 1m depth from an upland black spruce forest near Nome Creek, Alaska. We measured geochemistry, GHG fluxes, potential soil enzyme activities and microbial community structure via 16SrRNA gene and metagenome sequencing. We found that soil moisture, C content and the potential for respiration were reduced by fire, as were microbial community diversity and metabolic potential. There were shifts in dominance of several microbial community members, including a higher abundance of candidate phylum AD3 after fire. The metagenome data showed that fire had a pervasive impact on genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, methanogenesis and the nitrogen cycle. Although fire resulted in an immediate release of CO2 from surface soils, our results suggest that the potential for emission of GHG was ultimately reduced at all soil depths over the longer term. Because of the size of the permafrost C reservoir, these results are crucial for understanding whether fire produces a positive or negative feedback loop contributing to the global C cycle.

TI  - Decoupling soil community structure, functional composition, and nitrogen metabolic activity driven by salinity in coastal wetlands
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Coastal wetlands, being a multifaceted and crucial global ecosystem, are facing significant impacts from diverse environmental alterations, particularly soil salinization. Concurrently, the escalation of extreme climate events, such as global warming, presents complex challenges for the protection and restoration efforts. Previous researches concerning microbial communities in the context of climate with continous line numbering change have predominantly concentrated on their structural aspects, with limited attention given to establishing relationships between community structure and functional attributes. In this study, a two-year investigation was conducted on conventional coastal wetland ecosystems, considering variations in salinity and seasonal temperature. Utilizing high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, isotope technology, and other methods to explore the bacterial community, nitrogen cycling functional groups, and nitrogen reduction process. This research aims to assess the holistic impacts of significant global environmental changes on microbial communities. The results suggest that salinity, acting as an environmental filter, has a significant impact on the microbial community composition. It leads to a decrease in species abundance, an increase in deterministic processes and the nesting of community succession, while also reducing the stability of microbial ecological networks. The mechanism by which soil salinity impacts bacterial communities involves three main aspects: direct effects, positive climate regulation, and negative regulation of soil properties. Surprisingly, soil salinity exerts a mild inhibitory influence on microbial functional genes and metabolic activity. The primary factors involved in the nitrogen reduction process include electron donors/acceptors, types of nitrogen sources, and organic carbon. The three processes are interconnected due to the impact of environmental factors and signal transmission among microbial populations. This study offers a novel scientific framework for the rehabilitation and enhancement of saline-alkali coastal ecosystems in the face of impending global changes. It achieves this by investigating the varied response patterns exhibited by microbial communities and ecological functional metabolism under salinity-induced stress.

TI  - Nitrous oxide emissions from grazed grassland as affected by a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide, and relationships with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
CP  - 1st International Symposium of Molecular Environmental Soil Science at the Interfaces in the Earths Critical Zone
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and, in grazed grassland systems where animals graze outdoor pastures, most of the N2O is emitted from animal urine nitrogen (N) deposited during grazing. Recently, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were found to be present in large numbers in soils as well in the ocean, suggesting a potentially important role for AOA, in addition to ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), in the nitrogen cycle. The relationship between N2O emissions and AOB and AOA populations is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the quantitative relationship between N2O emissions and AOB and AOA populations in nitrogen-rich grassland soils.
   We determined N2O emissions and the abundance and activity of AOB and AOA in four different soils as affected by the applications of animal urine N and dicyandiamide (DCD) as a nitrification inhibitor. Relationships were then determined between N2O emissions and the AOB and AOA populations.
   Total N2O emissions from the urine N applied at 1,000 kg N ha(-1) varied significantly in these soils, from 13.9 to 39.8 kg N2O-N ha(-1). The DCD treatment reduced these N2O emissions to between 2.8 and 15.3 kg N2O-N ha(-1). The average emission factor of the urine N (EF3) was 2.2% and this was decreased to 0.8%, representing a 64% reduction. Total N2O emissions were significantly related to the amoA gene copy numbers of the AOB population and to the amount of nitrate-N in the soil, but not related to the abundance of AOA.
   These results demonstrate that the N2O flux is mainly associated with the dynamics of the AOB population rather than the AOA in these nitrogen-rich grassland soils, and therefore, it is the AOB that should be the target of inhibition when mitigating N2O emissions using nitrification inhibitors.

TI  - Microbial response to seasonal variation in arctic biocrusts with a focus on fungi and cyanobacteria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Biocrusts are crucial components of Arctic ecosystems, playing significant roles in carbon and nitrogen cycling, especially in regions where plant growth is limited. However, the microbial communities within Arctic biocrusts and their strategies for surviving the harsh conditions remain poorly understood. In this study, the microbial profiles of Arctic biocrusts across different seasons (summer, autumn, and winter) were investigated in order to elucidate their survival strategies in extreme conditions. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses revealed significant differences in microbial community composition among the sites located in different elevations. The bacterial communities were dominated by Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, while the fungal communities were mainly represented by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, with lichenized and saprotrophic traits prevailing. Cyanobacteria were primarily composed of heterocystous cyanobacteria. Furthermore, the study identified molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation, including the expression of heat shock proteins and coldinducible RNA helicases in cyanobacteria and fungi. Overall, the microbial communities appear to be permanently well adapted to the extreme environment.

TI  - Nitrogen deposition enhances the deterministic process of the prokaryotic community and increases the complexity of the microbial co-network in coastal wetlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Global nitrogen deposition has increased significantly in recent years. At present, research on the effects of different amounts and types of nitrogen deposition on soil microorganisms in coastal wetlands is scarce. In this study, based on 7 years of simulated nitrogen deposition at multiple levels (low, medium, high) and of multiple types (NH4NO3, NH4Cl, KNO3), the effects of different nitrogen deposition conditions on the diversity, community assembly processes, co-networks, and community function of soil prokaryotes in coastal wetlands were examined. The results showed that, compared with that in control, the microbial alpha diversity increased significantly under nitrogen deposition (P < 0.05). However, it decreased significantly in the high-NH4NO3 and high-NH4Cl treatments (P < 0.05). The deterministic process of community assembly was strengthened under the different types of nitrogen deposition. Compared with that under NH4+-N deposition, the microbial co-network under NO3--N deposition was more complex. Network stabil-ity significantly decreased under different NH4+-N deposition levels. In addition, the results of FAPROTAX functional prediction showed that microbial community functional groups associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling changed significantly (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our results emphasize that nitrogen deposition environments cause changes in soil microbial community structure and interactions, and may also affect soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, but the effects of different forms and levels of nitrogen deposition are not consistent. This study provides new insights for eval-uating the changes in soil microbial communities in coastal wetlands caused by different types of long-term nitrogen deposition, and has scientific significance for assessing the ecological effects of long-term nitrogen deposition.

TI  - Nitrogen addition enhanced Per-fluoroalkyl substances' microbial availability in a wheat soil ecosystem
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been widely detected in farmland soils and are understood to pose toxicological threats to soil microbiomes and crop safety. Meanwhile, farmland ecosystems have experienced increasing nitrogen loading caused by soil fertilization. Yet it is still unclear how nitrogen additions affect soil's microbial responses to PFASs. In this study, using a laboratory-based ecological experiment, we assessed the microbial availability of PFASs in soils receiving ammonium, nitrate, and urea nitrogen amendments by quantifying the translocation factors of PFASs from soil particle to soil extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Our results showed that nitrogen, specifically ammonium, significantly increased the PFASs' microbial availability (p < 0.05). Second, nitrogen fertilization in PFASs-polluted soils decreased the microbial community diversity and stability at the structural, species, and functional levels (p < 0.05). For soil microbial activities, nitrogen enhanced the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) while it inhibited the catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) (p < 0.01). Congruently, PFASs, as well as the nitrate and nitrite nitrogen, were shown to be the predominant abiotic drivers regulating the soil fungal succession (p < 0.05), while bacteria were mostly regulated by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (p < 0.01). Furthermore, we revealed that the nitrogen cycling gene hmp (dominates the transformation from NO to NO3-) was the hub gene integrating the microbially available PFASs and the soil nitrogen cycling processes (p < 0.01), indicating that hmp could be the core regulator affecting the accumulation of PFASs in soil EPS. Our study highlighted that decreasing ammonia's amendments could mitigate China's national initiatives to reduce nitrogen fertilization in farmlands, reduce the PFASs' availability to the soil microbiome, and protect the microbial community stability in soil.

TI  - Differential response of N2O emissions, N2O-producing and N2O-reducing bacteria to varying tetracycline doses in fertilized soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Tetracyclines are the most widely used antibiotics worldwide. Their presence in soils could affect nutrient cycling, but our knowledge regarding how they affect soil microbial communities involved in greenhouse gas emissions is limited. The objective of the current study was to evaluate how tetracycline is affecting N2O emissions and the abundance of denitrifiers in fertilized soil. For this purpose, soil mesocosms were treated with only NH4NO3 (100 mg/kg) or NH4NO3 (100 mg/kg) plus three different doses of tetracycline (0.1, 0.5 and 2 mg/ kg). Soils that did not receive tetracycline or NH4NO3 were used as controls. Nitrous oxide fluxes were monitored daily for 16 days. The total bacterial (16S rRNA), the abundance of N2O-reducing and -producing bacteria were quantified by qPCR at the end of the experiment. The application of NH4NO3 caused a significant increase of N2O emissions and AOB abundance but did not affect the abundance of denitrifiers and AOA compared to control soils. Different doses of tetracycline in fertilized soils did not mitigate these N2O emissions; instead, higher cumulative emissions were noticed in soils treated with the lowest dose. In these soils the total bacterial abundance was higher compared to soils received higher tetracycline concentration. The abundances of the N2Oproducing and N2O-reducing communities were also differently affected by the addition of tetracycline, which was dose-dependent. Higher doses of tetracycline favored N2O-reducers within the total bacterial community, which could be important for mitigating N2O emissions in the long term.

TI  - The Multifunctional Role of Ectomycorrhizal Associations in Forest Ecosystem Processes
T2  - BOTANICAL REVIEW
AB  - Belowground biological interactions that occur among plant roots, microorganisms and animals are dynamic and substantially influence ecosystem processes. Among these interactions, the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis is remarkable but unfortunately these associations have mainly been considered within the rather narrow perspective of their effects on the uptake of dissolved mineral nutrients by individual plants. More recent research has placed emphasis on a wider, multifunctional perspective, including the effects of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis on plant and microbial communities, and on ecosystem processes. This includes mobilization of N and P from organic polymers, release of nutrients from mineral particles or rock surfaces via weathering, effects on carbon cycling, interactions with mycoheterotrophic plants, mediation of plant responses to stress factors such as drought, soil acidification, toxic metals, and plant pathogens, rehabilitation and regeneration of degraded forest ecosystems, as well as a range of possible interactions with groups of other soil microorganisms. Ectomycorrhizas are almost invariably characterized by a Hartig net composed of highly branched hyphae which entirely surround the outer root cortical cells. The Hartig net is the place of massive bidirectional exchanges of nutrients between the host and the fungus. Through these branched hyphae ectomycorrhizal fungi connect their plant hosts to the heterogeneously distributed nutrients required for their growth, enabling the flow of energy-rich compounds required for nutrient mobilization whilst simultaneously providing conduits for the translocation of mobilized products back to their hosts. In addition to increasing the nutrient absorptive surface area of their host plant root systems, the extraradical mycelium of ectomycorrhizal fungi provides a direct pathway for translocation of photosynthetically derived carbon from their hosts to microsites in the soil and a large surface area for interaction with other soil micro-organisms. The detailed functioning and regulation of these mycorrhizosphere processes is still poorly understood and needs detailed molecular approach to study these mycorrhizosphere processes but recent progress in ectomycorrhizal associations is reviewed and potential benefits of improved understanding of mycorrhizosphere interactions are discussed.

TI  - Key factors influencing the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon and its fractions in Mollisols
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key component of the global carbon pool, which is crucial to the fertility and health of soils and deeply influences global carbon cycling. "Mollisols belts" with high SOC storage are considered as the natural breadbasket of the world, and SOC transformation between the sources and sinks profoundly affects global climate change. In this review, based on the newest publications, the effects of both natural and anthropic factors on the decomposition, migration, and transformation of SOC and further influencing the spatial distribution of SOC and its fractions in Mollisols were summarized. Furthermore, we summarized the debates on the spatial changes of SOC and its fractions in Mollisols from publications and analyzed the causes of these debates. Generally, climate change, land use types, fertilization, tillage practices combined with topographic factors, hydrologic process, and soil erosion process significantly influence the spatial distribution of SOC. As well, in the Mollisols, (1) Global warming and elevated CO2 may increase the content of labile organic carbon fractions and affect the soil-atmosphere carbon cycle. (2) The conversion of abandoned cropland to forest or grassland, and the conversion of dry cropland to paddy field may improve the carbon sequestration capacity of terrestrial ecosystems, while rational fertilization and organic inputs reduce the SOC loss of natural ecosystems converting to cropland. (3) Conservation tillage in cropland improves the SOC storage by increasing the pool of labile organic carbon in soils. (4) A reasonable combination ratio of organic and chemical fertilization is crucial for achieving the stability of the SOC pool and the increase of the SOC storage in soils. At the end of this review, the key issues on the spatial distribution of SOC and the driving mechanisms were prospected in the future.

TI  - Residue quality drives SOC sequestration by altering microbial taxonomic composition and ecophysiological function in desert ecosystem
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Plant residues are important sources of soil organic carbon in terrestrial ecosystems. The degradation of plant residue by microbes can influence the soil carbon cycle and sequestration. However, little is known about the microbial composition and function, as well as the accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) in response to the inputs of different quality plant residues in the desert environment. The present study evaluated the effects of plant residue addition from Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (Pi), Artemisia desertorum (Ar) and Amorpha fruticosa (Am) on desert soil microbial community composition and function in a field experiment in the Mu Us Desert. The results showed that the addition of the three plant residues with different C/N ratios induced significant variation in soil microbial communities. The Am treatment (low C/N ratio) improved microbial diversity compared with the Ar and Pi treatments (medium and high C/N ratios). The variations in the taxonomic and functional compositions of the dominant phyla Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were higher than those of the other phyla among the different treatments. Moreover, the network links between Proteobacteria and other phyla and the CAZyme genes abundances from Proteobacteria increased with increasing residue C/N, whereas those decreased for Actinobacteria. The SOC content of the Am, Ar and Pi treatments increased by 45.73%, 66.54% and 107.99%, respectively, as compared to the original soil. The net SOC accumulation was positively correlated with Proteobacteria abundance and negatively correlated with Actinobacteria abundance. These findings showed that changing the initial quality of plant residue from low C/N to high C/N can result in shifts in taxonomic and functional composition from Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria, which favors SOC accumulation. This study elucidates the ecophysiological roles of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria in the desert carbon cycle, expands our understanding of the potential microbial-mediated mechanisms by which plant residue inputs affect SOC sequestration in desert soils, and provides valuable guidance for species selection in desert vegetation reconstruction.

TI  - Improving the Nitrogen Cycling in Livestock Systems Through Silvopastoral Systems
T2  - NUTRIENT DYNAMICS FOR SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION
AB  - Conventional livestock are monoculture systems where the major species are native grasses or African grasses, with biomass production being limited by seasonality of rainfall and low soil fertility. In animal production systems, the pasture degradation is associated with the nitrogen (N) cycle. Therefore, if farmer applied no subsequent fertilizer, milk production or live weight gains have been gradually reduced. As animals slowly gain weight, they produce more methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N(2)0). This has led to the search for strategies to help minimize the impacts of livestock, and the excessive application of fertilizers, on the environment and natural resources. One strategy with promising results that has been developed in Latin America is the conversion of traditional livestock systems to silvopastoral systems (SPS), which include the establishment of shrub legumes at high densities and forage grasses aimed at increasing livestock profitability. With the association of legumes and forage grasses, forage quality can increase, more than 100%, compared to monoculture-based pastures and, consequently, production costs related to the purchase of imported cereal grains and nitrogen fertilizers are reduced. On the other hand, changes in climate and grazing pressure to increase stocking rate have resulted in extensive degradation of existing vulnerable pastures, which favour poorly palatable, perennial species, affecting directly livestock production and enhancing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the loss of soil carbon and nitrogen stock severely affecting soil fertility. The importance of the association of species of legumes with grasses and Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala L., (Lam.) de Wit) is an environmentally friendly proposal of positive interactions to improve soil fertility and animal productivity. Overall, improving forage quality and N efficiency of dietary nutrients is an effective way of decreasing GHG. Silvopastoral systems (SPS) are used successfully in many regions around the world, and there is considerable evidence that SPS can increase production efficiency, increase carbon sequestration and improve N cycling on land used for livestock production.

TI  - The biogeography of soil microbiome potential growth rates
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Soil microbial growth, a vital biogeochemical process, governs both the accrual and loss of soil carbon. Here, we investigate the biogeography of soil microbiome potential growth rates and show that microbiomes in resource-rich (high organic matter and nutrients) and acid-neutral soils from cold and humid regions exhibit high potential growth. Conversely, in resource-poor, dry, hot, and hypersaline soils, soil microbiomes display lower potential growth rates, suggesting trade-offs between growth and resource acquisition or stress tolerance. In addition, the potential growth rates of soil microbiomes positively correlates with genome size and the number of ribosomal RNA operons but negatively correlates with optimum temperature, biomass carbon-to-phosphorus and nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios. The spatial variation of microbial potential growth rates aligns with several macroecological theories. These findings not only enhance our understanding of microbial adaptation to diverse environments but also aid in realistically parameterizing microbial physiology in soil carbon cycling models.
   Soil microbial growth controls carbon sequestration. Here, the authors show that resource-rich, neutral soils from cold and humid areas have higher growth potential than resource-poor, hypersaline soil from dry and hot regions, demonstrating diverse microbial adaptations.

TI  - Inclusive Indian Central Himalayan soil carbon estimates underscores significant inorganic carbon contribution and temporal dynamics: Implications for carbon sequestration
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Soil carbon estimates in the Indian Himalayan region-a global climate change hotspot-primarily rely on the lossy wet oxidation method and predominantly focus on soil organic carbon (SOC), neglecting the soil inorganic carbon (SIC) component. Sensitive and holistic soil carbon estimates are crucial for effective policy planning. By incorporating eight major Central Himalayan forest types along a 3000 m elevational gradient, we report that the acidic Himalayan soil (surface soil pH: 4.74-6.84) of the selected forest types hold up to 31% of the total soil carbon stock as SIC stock. Using soil carbon and soil organic matter assays based on elemental analyzer and the loss-on-ignition method, we established that these Himalayan soils store less than 50% of SOC in SOM, challenging the use of universal factors in the region. The amount of SOC in SOM also showed temporal variability. The machine learning Random Forest algorithm highlighted the influence of SOM and climate variables in regulating the distribution of SOC, microbial biomass carbon, and key carbon cycling soil enzymes. The vertical distribution of SOC was more uniform than that of SIC. We found higher activity of soil carbon-cycling enzymes (dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, and phenol oxidase) in the forest types. Sensitive and higher soil carbon estimates substantiate a lower microbial quotient (0.17-1.23 %) than the regional trend. Notably, we explained how seasonal and temporal changes in soil carbon estimations hinder a constant positive soil carbon flux. Meanwhile, the mean surface SOC flux (4.63 Mg C ha- 1 yr- 1 ) and SIC flux (1.68 Mg C ha- 1 yr- 1 ) indicate that the Himalayan soils have significant potential for carbon sequestration. In conclusion, our research indicates substantial soil organic and inorganic carbon storage in major Central Himalayan forest types, with negative anthropogenic activities posing a clear and present threat to the soil carbon stocks.

TI  - Long-term manipulation of mean climatic conditions alters drought effects on C- and N-cycling in an arable soil
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Climate is changing and predicted future scenarios include both changes in long-term mean climatic conditions and intensification of extreme events such as drought. Drought can have a major impact on soil functional processes; soil microorganisms, key to these processes, depend on water and temperature dynamics. Consequently, feedback mechanisms regarding microbially mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling in soils may be affected. There are indications that microbial exposure to increasingly unfavorable environmental conditions influences their stress responses. Here, the long-term field experiment Hohenheim Climate Change (HoCC) provided a research platform to explore how microbial exposure to long-term reduced water availability and soil warming modifies microbially driven soil processes, especially gas fluxes from soil, both during drought and after rewetting. The HoCC experiment is an agroecosystem in which the soil microbiome has been exposed to reduced annual mean precipitation and elevated temperature since 2008. Treatment levels were chosen based on a realistic future climate scenario. In June 2019, we exposed this system to a drought period of four weeks. We found that even after 11 years, warming remained a driver of CO2 and N2O fluxes across the different soil moisture conditions in our drought experiment. Importantly, however, microbial exposure to long-term reduced water availability limited the stimulatory effect of warming on gas fluxes during drought and after rewetting. Our results were neither related to a legacy effect within overall microbial biomass carbon levels nor a shift towards enhanced fungal abundance. We found no indications that extracellular enzyme activities or microbial substrate availability explained the gas flux dynamics observed in our drought experiment. Our study indicates that soil warming promotes gaseous C and N loss even under extreme drought conditions. We suspect, however, that a shift in microbial function following long-term water limitation can hamper the enhancing effect of warming on soil gas fluxes.

TI  - FACTORS CONTROLLING KEY NITROGEN FLUXES IN GRASSLAND ECOSYSTEMS: CASE STUDIES - SOUTHERN ROMANIA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - Enhanced nitrogen inputs to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems affects biodiversity at all its levels. Grasslands provide a complex range of functions, due to their wide representation throughout terrestrial ecosystems. Numerous studies demonstrate soil acidification, eutrophication and species richness reduction as a result of elevated reactive nitrogen availability. The present study aims to assess soil nitrogen stocks and transformations for two Romanian grasslands during November 2011 - November 2013, integrating the microbial population dynamics of two important functional groups involved in terrestrial nitrogen cycle: ammonifiers and denitrifiers. Our research focused on pristine systems, as well as on an experiment that simulated high nitrogen inputs of 100 kg N/ha/year (during 2012 and 2013) for one of the two selected study areas.

TI  - Analysis of effects and factors linked to soil microbial populations and nitrogen cycling under long-term biosolids application
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Information about impacts of long-term biosolids application on soil microbial populations and functional groups and N cycling is important for evaluating soil health and agroecosystem sustainability under long-term biosolids application. Mine spoil plots received annual biosolids application from 1973 to 2010 at low (16.8 Mg ha-1 yr- 1), medium (33.6 Mg ha-1 yr- 1), and high rates (67.2 Mg ha-1 yr- 1). A no-biosolids control received chemical fertilizer at the agronomic rate. Soil samples were collected in three seasons per year spanning 2003-2005 for measuring soil moisture, pH, soil organic C (SOC), total and extractable heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Ni, Zn), NO3-, N mineralization potential (NMP), microbial biomass C (MBC), and populations of three N-cycling bacteria (NCB) groups: ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), and denitrifying bacteria (DNB). Soil samples were collected again in 2008 and 2010 for quantifying total and extractable heavy metals, and in 2018 (eight years after biosolids applications ended) for measuring SOC, MBC, NMP, and microbial respiration. During 2003-2005, mean MBC was 315, 554, 794, and 1001 mg kg-1 in the control, low, medium, and high biosolids treatments, respectively. Populations of NCB did not differ among treatments. Biosolids application increased total and extractable metal concentrations but the effect of biosolids rates were much lower on extractable than total concentrations. Soil extractable Cd and Cu concentrations decreased from medium to high applications, likely due to complexing with biosolids organic matter. Partial least squares regression analysis identified a strong positive effect on MBC of SOC and a weak negative effect of Cu, explaining the strong net positive effect of biosolids on MBC. In 2018, the medium and high biosolids treatments maintained higher SOC, MBC, NMP, and microbial respiration than the control. This study provided further evidence that long-term biosolids application has positive effects on soil microbes that persist for years after ending application.

TI  - The influence of tide-brought nutrients on microbial carbon metabolic profiles of mangrove sediments
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems in the intertidal zone are continually affected by tidal inundation, but the impact of tidal-driven nutrient inputs upon bacterial communities and carbon metabolic features in mangrove surface sediments remains underexplored, and the differences in such impacts across backgrounds are not known. Here, two mangrove habitats with contrasting nutrient backgrounds in Shenzhen Bay and Daya Bay in Shenzhen City, China, respectively, were studied to investigate the effects of varying tidal nutrient inputs (especially dissolved inorganic nitrogen and PO43--P) on bacterial community composition and functioning in sediment via field sampling, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, and the quantitative potential of microbial element cycling. Results showed that tidal input increased Shenzhen Bay mangrove's eutrophication level whereas it maintained the Daya Bay mangrove's relatively oligotrophic status. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen and PO43--P levels in Shenzhen Bay were respectively 12.6-39.6 and 7.3-29.1 times higher than those in Daya Bay (p < 0.05). In terms of microbial features, Desulfobacteraceae was the dominant family in Shenzhen Bay, while the Anaerolineaceae family dominated in Daya Bay. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed more interconnected and complex microbial networks in Shenzhen Bay. The quantitative gene-chip analysis uncovered more carbon-related functional genes (including carbon degradation and fixation) enriched in Shenzhen Bay's sediment microbial communities than Daya Bay's. Partial least squares path modeling indicated that tidal behavior directly affected mangrove sediments' physicochemical characteristics, with cascading effects shaping microbial diversity and C-cycling function. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that how tides influence the microbial carbon cycle in mangrove sediments is co-correlated with the concentration of nutrient inputs and background status of sediment. This work offers an insightful lens for better understanding bacterial community structure and carbon metabolic features in mangrove sediments under their tidal influences. It provides a theoretical basis to better evaluate and protect mangroves in the context of global change.

TI  - Effects of applying locust frass on the soil properties and microbial community in a peach orchard
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Insect frass, a by-product of insect cultivation, represents an emergent category of agricultural waste. How to develop and make full use of this waste is a major issue to be addressed. In this study, the locust (Locusta migratoria) frass was used as an organic fertilizer in a peach orchard, and its effects on soil were investigated, including physicochemical properties and microbial community over three consecutive years. Compared to chemical fertilizer (CF), the application of locust frass (LF) enhanced the alpha diversity and network complexity of the soil microbial community. Furthermore, locust frass application led to an enrichment of functional microbial groups associated with the nitrogen cycle and enhanced the contents of nitrogen in the soil. Bacillus was identified as keystone microbes that discriminated between locust frass and chemical fertilizer treatments, and promoted the growth of Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L.) in pot experiments. The abundance of Bacillus diminished with successive applications of chemical fertilizers, whereas its prevalence remained consistent in the soil with application of locust frass. Importantly, locust frass application led to an enrichment of functional microbial groups associated with the nitrogen cycle and enhanced the contents of nitrogen in the soil. Structural equation modeling (SEM) suggests that nitrite respiration after locust frass application had a negative effect on soil total nitrogen content and that total nitrogen affected the entire taxa by affecting the rare taxa. Our results provided a theoretical basis for the application of locust frass as organic fertilizer.IMPORTANCEInsect frass is a new type of organic fertilizer. The effects of some insect frass on soil have been investigated. However, the effect of locust frass (LF) (a by-product of the rearing process of this major edible insect) as an organic fertilizer is not well known. This study investigates the effects of locust frass on soil properties and the microbial community, providing valuable guide on its use as an organic fertilizer in agricultural production.

TI  - Diversity and Plant Growth-Promoting Properties of Rhodiola rosea Root Endophytic Bacteria
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Plants inhabiting environments with suboptimal growth conditions often have a more pronounced capacity to attract and sustain microbial communities that improve nutrient absorption and expand abiotic stress tolerance. Rhodiola rosea L. is a succulent plant of the Crassulaceae family adapted to survive in sandy or rocky soils or dry tundra. The aim of the present study was to investigate the diversity and plant growth-stimulating potential of R. rosea endophytic microbiota. Metataxonomic analysis of the bacterial diversity in the rhizome of R. rosea revealed 108 families. Among these, three families were found exclusively in the core microbiome of 1-year-old plants, while nine families were unique to the core microbiome of mature plants grown in the field for more than 4 years. Seventy-three endophytic bacteria isolates were obtained from the rhizome of R. rosea plants and were assigned into 14 distinct bacterial genera of Firmicutes (26%) or Proteobacteria (74%) phyla. Screening for functional genes related to the nitrogen cycle, phosphorus mineralisation or dissolution, and traits associated with nitrogen fixation (56% of isolates), siderophore production (40%), inorganic phosphorus solubilisation (30%), and production of indole-related compounds (51%) led to the classification of the isolates into 16 distinct clusters. Co-cultivation of 45 selected isolates with germinating Arabidopsis seedlings revealed 18 and 5 isolates that resulted in more than a 20% increase in root or shoot growth, respectively. The study results established the complexity of the succulent R. rosea endophytic microbiome and identified isolates for potential plant growth-stimulating applications.

TI  - Insights about biocrust effects on soil gas transport and aeration in drylands: Permeability, diffusivity, and their connection to hydraulic conductivity
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Soil gas transport properties and aeration are essential influencing factors of soil chemical and biochemical reactions, especially the respiration processes of plant roots and microorganisms. As ecosystem engineers in drylands, biocrusts may greatly alter surface soil gas transport properties and aeration, but their influences remain unclear and understudied. In a semiarid dryland ecosystem on the Chinese Loess Plateau, the air permeability of bare soil and three types of biocrusts (cyanobacterial, cyanobacterial-moss mixed, and moss crusts) were measured in-situ with naturally changing soil water content. Undisturbed soil samples were also taken for each treatment, and their air permeability and relative gas diffusivity at air-dried and near-saturated conditions, as well as saturated hydraulic conductivity, were determined in the laboratory. We further analyzed the relationship between saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability or relative gas diffusivity and calculated the gas and permeability continuity (specific air permeability and specific gas diffusivity) and tortuosity indexes at air-dry and near-saturation. Our results showed that biocrusts were associated with a significantly higher air permeability in contrast to bare soil, and the in situ mean air permeability ranked in order of moss crusts > mixed crusts > cyanobacterial crusts > bare soil. At air-dried condition, biocrusts increased surface soil air permeability by 26% and relative gas diffusivity by 46% as compared with bare soil through decreased surface soil bulk density. In contrast, at near saturation biocrusts decreased air permeability and relative gas diffusivity by 33% and 20%, respectively, which was attributed to pore-clogging by extracellular polymeric substances of biocrusts (3.37 vs. 2.27 mg g(-1)). Accordingly, at air-dried condition biocrusts increased specific air permeability by 11% and specific gas diffusivity by 30% but decreased tortuosity by 7%. In contrast, they decreased specific air permeability by 76% and specific gas diffusivity by 39% but increased tortuosity by 28% at near-saturated condition. Additionally, the saturated hydraulic conductivity of cyanobacterial, cyanobacterial-moss mixed, and moss crusts were respectively 77%, 69%, and 61% lower than that of bare soil. We found that the relationship between saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability or relative gas diffusivity of biocrusts at air-dried condition can be well fitted with a positive linear log-log model (R2 > 0.95). In general, the improved gas transport properties of surface soil caused by different types of biocrusts leads to better soil aeration, which in turn would facilitate microbial activity, soil respiration, and root growth; and impact surface soil water vapor movement induced by evaporation or condensation processes in drylands. Therefore, biocrusts should be carefully considered in further assessments of global dryland hydrology and carbon or nitrogen cycling under changing climate.

TI  - Microbial communities in carbonate rocksfrom soil via groundwater to rocks
T2  - JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Microbial communities in soil, groundwater, and rock of two sites in limestone were investigated to determine community parameters differentiating habitats in two lithostratigraphic untis. Lower Muschelkalk and Middle Muschelkalk associated soils, groundwater, and rock samples showed different, but overlapping microbial communities linked to carbon fluxes. The microbial diversities in soil were highest, groundwater revealed overlapping taxa but lower diversity, and rock samples were predominantly characterized by endospore forming bacteria and few archaea. Physiological profiles could establish a differentiation between habitats (soil, groundwater, rock). From community analyses and physiological profiles, different element cycles in limestone could be identified for the three habitats. While in soil, nitrogen cycling was identified as specific determinant, in rock methanogenesis linked carbonate rock to atmospheric methane cycles. These patterns specifically allowed for delineation of lithostratigraphic connections to physiological parameters.

TI  - Reducing Emissions From Degraded Floodplain Wetlands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Globally, freshwater wetlands are significant carbon sinks; however, altering a wetland's hydrology can reduce its ability to sequester carbon and may lead to the release of previously stored soil carbon. Rehabilitating a wetland's water table has the potential to restore the natural process of wetland soil carbon sequestration and storage. Further, little is known about the role of microbial communities that mediate carbon cycling during wetland rehabilitation practices. Here, we examined the carbon emissions and microbial community diversity during a wetland rehabilitation process known as "environmental watering" (rewetting) in an Australian, semi-arid freshwater floodplain wetland. By monitoring carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions during dry and wet phases of an environmental watering event, we determined that adding water to a degraded semi-arid floodplain wetland reduces carbon emissions by 28-84%. The watering event increased anoxic levels and plant growth in the aquatic zone of the wetland, which may correlate with lower carbon emissions during and after environmental watering due to lower anaerobic microbial decomposition processes and higher CO2 sequestration by vegetation. During the watering event, areas with higher inundation had lower CO2 emissions (5.15 +/- 2.50 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) compared to fringe areas surrounding the wetland (11.89 +/- 4.25 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)). CH4 flux was inversely correlated with CO2 emissions during inundation periods, showing a 38% (0.013 +/- 0.061 g CO2-e m(-2) day(-1)) increase when water was present in the wetland. During the dry phases of environmental watering, there was CH4 uptake within the fringe and aquatic zones (-0.013 +/- 0.063 g CO2-e m(-2) day(-1)). A clear succession of soil microbial community was observed during the dry-wet phases of the environmental watering process. This suggests that wetland hydrology plays a large role in the microbial community structure of these wetland ecosystems, and is consequently linked to CO2 and CH4 emissions. Overall, the total carbon emissions (CO2 + CH4) were reduced within the wetland during and after the environmental watering event, due to increasing vegetative growth and subsequent CO2 sequestration. We, therefore, recommend environmental watering practices in this degraded arid wetland ecosystem to improve conditions for wetland carbon sequestration and storage. Further use of this management practice may improve wetland carbon storage across other arid freshwater wetland ecosystems with similar hydrologic regimes.

TI  - Short-term impacts of biochar and manure application on soil labile carbon fractions, enzyme activity, and microbial community structure
T2  - BIOCHAR
AB  - Biochar is known to ameliorate soil fertility and increase crop yield; however, information regarding its effects on soil chemical and biological properties remains limited. The experiment was conducted to study the short-term impacts of different types of biochar on soil C fractions, enzyme activities, and microbial community structure at depositional and eroded landscape positions at different sampling times [before planting, after planting, and after harvesting of soybean (Glycine max L.)]. Three biochar materials, produced from C-optimized gasification of corn (maize, Zea mays L.) stover (CS), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson and C. Lawson) wood residue (PW), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) (SG), and dairy manure (DM) and mixture of dairy manure and pinewood biochar (DMP), were applied at a rate of 10 Mg ha(-1) to depositional and eroded landscape positions. Data showed that the application of DMP and sole application of DM treatments significantly increased the labile C fractions at the depositional and eroded landscapes. The addition of DM and DMP increased the activities of beta-glucosidase and urease enzymes, and those are involved in C and nitrogen cycling at depositional and eroded landscape positions. There were no significant differences between different biochar materials. However, there was an increase in soil microbial community structure in the DM and DMP treatments at both the landscape positions. In conclusion, our study revealed that DMP and sole application of DM influenced the soil labile C pool, enzyme activities, and microbial community structure at both the landscape positions for different sampling times.

TI  - Fire influences needle decomposition: Tipping point in Pinus radiata carbon chemistry and soil nitrogen transformations
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - As climate change proceeds, a change in the frequency and intensity of fire events is expected to affect soil organic matter (SOM) transformations within forestry systems. A likely consequence is the development of post-fire litter layers composed of thermally altered non-senescent materials that have fallen during a fire event. In this study, Pinus radiata needles were thermally altered to determine the effect of changes in carbon chemistry on needle decomposition and nitrogen cycling. Live needles were collected and dried at 40 degrees C before being further heated for 1 h in a muffle furnace at a range of temperatures > 40 degrees C (max. = 320 degrees C) to simulate a range of canopy temperatures that can occur during a fire, and then coarsely ground and screened (0.5-1.0 man fraction retained). These needles were characterised for carbon and nitrogen content, and carbon chemistry (solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy); they were also used in an incubation experiment (14 days) which was performed to assess the impact of heating on nitrogen transformations. Soil respiration and extractable nitrogen pools (mineral, potentially mineralizable, and microbial biomass) were measured throughout the incubation. During the incubation, cumulative respiration and nitrogen absorption capacity decreased with increasing thermal alteration. The results indicate a step change in the response of nitrogen pools to thermal alteration of pine needles, with a critical change occurring at or before 200 degrees C. This step change in nitrogen response may be due to the thermal degradation of light fraction organic matter, simple polysaccharides, or both. From this experiment it is clear that a post fire litter layer can have distinctly different effects on the soil environment depending on canopy temperature conditions during the fire with post fire litters composed of low temperature needles absorbing most mineral nitrogen that they contact. This will in turn affect post-fire plant recovery and therefore ecological succession.

TI  - Multi-experiment assessment of soil nitrous oxide emissions in sugarcane
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes comprise a significant part of the greenhouse gas emissions of agricultural products but are spatially and temporally variable, due to complex interactions between climate, soil and management variables. This study aimed to identify the main factors that affect N2O emissions under sugarcane, using a multi-site database from field experiments. Greenhouse gas fluxes, soil, climate, and management data were obtained from 13 field trials spanning the 2011-2017 period. We conducted exploratory, descriptive and inferential data analyses in experiments with varying fertiliser and stillage (vinasse) type and rate, and crop residue rates. The most relevant period of high N2O fluxes was the first 46 days after fertiliser application. The results indicate a strong positive correlation of cumulative N2O with nitrogen (N) fertiliser rate, soil fungi community (18S rRNA gene), soil ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-); and a moderate negative correlation with amoA genes of ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) and soil organic matter content. The regression analysis revealed that easily routinely measured climate and management-related variables explained over 50% of the variation in cumulative N2O emissions, and that additional soil chemical and physical parameters improved the regression fit with an R2 = 0.65. Cross-wavelet analysis indicated significant correlations of N2O fluxes with rainfall and air temperature up to 64 days, associated with temporal lags of 2 to 4 days in some experiments, and presenting a good environmental control over fluxes in general. The nitrogen fertiliser mean emission factors ranged from 0.03 to 1.17% of N applied, with urea and ammonium nitrate plus vinasse producing high emissions, while ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate without vinasse, calcium nitrate, and mitigation alternatives (nitrification inhibitors and timing of vinasse application) producing low N2O-EFs. Measurements from multiple sites spanning several cropping seasons were useful for exploring the influence of environmental and management-related variables on soil N2O emissions in sugarcane production, providing support for global warming mitigation strategies, nitrogen management policies, and increased agricultural input efficiency.

TI  - Feedback responses of soil greenhouse gas emissions to climate change are modulated by soil characteristics in dryland ecosystems
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Understanding feedback responses of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to future climate projections is critical for the effective development of mitigation and adaptation strategies. It is proposed that effects of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature can have differential effects on GHG fluxes but the magnitude and direction of such impact is not fully known, especially in dryland ecosystems, which are typically water and nutrient limited. We examined individual and interactive impacts of elevated CO2 (400 ppm vs. 600 ppm) and elevated temperature (ambient vs. +3 degrees C increase) treatments on GHG fluxes, in three Australian dryland soils. Firstly, we quantified the individual and interactive effects of elevated CO2 and temperature on CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and the corresponding soil net global warming potential (GWP). Secondly, biotic and abiotic drivers of GHG emissions were identified by exploring the relationship between CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes with the abundance of bacteria, methanotrophs and N2O-reducing bacteria as well as soil abiotic characteristics. Our results show that soil CO2 emissions and CH4 uptake respond mainly to elevated temperature in all dryland soils tested, with interactive treatment effects showing a less than additive trend on soil net GWP. Nitrous oxide emissions responded less to climate change treatments, and these were site-specific. Soil site characteristics were the main determinant of all GHG emissions; however, the abundance of total bacteria and N2O-reducing bacteria significantly explained CO2 and N2O fluxes, respectively. This study shows that dryland soils respond to climate change with an offset under interactive climate treatments. Our findings suggest that future studies on GHG feedback responses should explicitly consider both biotic and abiotic soil characteristics in order to provide a better mechanistic understanding for the development of future mitigation strategies.

TI  - The synchrony of cover crop decomposition, enzyme activity, and nitrogen availability in a corn agroecosystem in the Midwest United States
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Cover cropping is commonly associated with increased soil microbial activity and soil health. Cover cropping in the Upper Mississippi River Basin has increased rapidly in the last decade due to the demonstrated ability that cover crops can increase soil health and decrease nitrate losses in tile-drained fields. One reason cover cropping is not adopted in the Midwest United States is the lack of knowledge on the synchrony of cover crop residue nitrogen (N) release and corn N demand. Therefore, the overarching goal of this research was to investigate soil enzyme activity and inorganic N availability during the decomposition period of common winter cover crops. Objectives were: i) to determine if soil enzyme activity (beta-glucosidase and urease) is influenced by different cover crops (cereal rye (CR), hairy vetch (HV), and HV/CR mixture) and tillage systems (reduced tillage and no-tillage residue management) during the residue decomposition period, and ii) to determine the relationship between soil enzyme activity, inorganic N availability, and critical corn growth stages during cover crop decomposition. Cover crops in this study were selected due to contrast in residue carbon (C):N ratios, their commonality among regional farmers, and their differences in physiology. Spring tillage and no-tillage were investigated because of the differing levels of soil disturbance and residue incorporation. Enzyme activities were quantified at seven sampling dates following cover crop termination from April-October during the 2016 and 2017 corn growing seasons. Results revealed significant effects of sampling date (p < 0.001) and cover crop treatment (p < 0.05) on soil beta-glucosidase activity and significant interaction effects between sampling date and cover crop treatment (p < 0.05) on potential soil urease activity. Tillage had a significant impact on soil beta-glucosidase (p < 0.001) and urease (p < 0.05) activities in 2017, with higher activity observed in the notillage soil. These findings indicate that enzyme activity fluxes can be observed in agroecosystems one year after introducing conservation practices, such as cover crops and no-tillage. Greater than 50 % of C release from cover crop residue occurred from corn emergence to tasseling, and significantly greater beta-glucosidase activity for CR-based treatments during corn peak N demand did not result in more soil inorganic N. This indicates a loss of plant-available N from the agroecosystem, which could be attributed to N immobilization by the soil microbial community. This study demonstrates a need to develop adaptive N fertilization management for corn that can overcome the potential impact of N immobilization during peak corn N demand following CR.

TI  - Hydrolyzed Organic Fish Fertilizer and Poultry Litter Influence Yield and Rhizosphere Ecology of Sweetpotato
T2  - HORTSCIENCE
AB  - Organic fertilization techniques have become an attractive alternative to conventional techniques, but there remains interest in their impact on rhizosphere ecology. This study was aimed at assessing the impacts of various organic fertilizer amendments on storage root yield, chemical, biochemical, and microbial factors in the rhizosphere ecosystem and the bacterial community composition in the rhizosphere ecosystem. Four sweetpotato cultivars (J6/66, NCC-58, TU Purple, and Whatley/Loretan) and four organic fertilizer treatments [poultry litter, Megabloom (fish protein), NPK, and an untreated control] were used in the study. The experiments were conducted as a randomized complete block design with a 434 factorial treatment arrangement and three replications. Fertilizer treatments were split-applied at the rate of 134-67-67 kg.ha(-1) NPK equivalent based on soil test recommendations 1 and 4 weeks after planting as single bands 15 cm from the plants and organic amendments were calculated based on total N content. Rhizosphere soil samples were collected at harvest and analyzed for soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), bacterial 16S rDNA, and selected soil enzymes. Organic amendments did not affect storage root yield or percent dry matter but enhanced both the mass and number of US#1 storage roots. Rhizosphere pH varied depending on cultivar and cultivar response varied with pH and ranged from 6.1 to 6.8, whereas SOC was similar regardless of the amendment. The impact of fertilizers was evident as Megabloom(fish protein) treatment suppressed the relative abundance (RA) of nitrifiers (Nitrosococcus and Nitrosomonadaceae). Also, the rhizosphere of 'Whatley/Loretan' seemed to have been a beneficial habitat for populations of common nitrogen-fixing bacteria Bradyrhizobium elkanii, and Rhodospirillaceae sp. as their RA increased significantly in the rhizosphere. That bacteria associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling under aerobic conditions were found to be ubiquitous in the rhizosphere of sweetpotato, suggesting that certain amendments positively impacted the populations of nitrogen-cycling bacteria, thus making them a viable alternative to NPK when considering increasing or sustaining yield while promoting long-term soil health.

TI  - Physical-chemical and microbiological changes in Cerrado Soil under differing sugarcane harvest management systems
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Sugarcane cultivation plays an important role in Brazilian economy, and it is expanding fast, mainly due to the increasing demand for ethanol production. In order to understand the impact of sugarcane cultivation and management, we studied sugarcane under different management regimes (pre-harvest burn and mechanical, unburnt harvest, or green cane), next to a control treatment with native vegetation. The soil bacterial community structure (including an evaluation of the diversity of the ammonia oxidizing (amoA) and denitrifying (nirK) genes), greenhouse gas flow and several soil physicochemical properties were evaluated.
   Results: Our results indicate that sugarcane cultivation in this region resulted in changes in several soil properties. Moreover, such changes are reflected in the soil microbiota. No significant influence of soil management on greenhouse gas fluxes was found. However, we did find a relationship between the biological changes and the dynamics of soil nutrients. In particular, the burnt cane and green cane treatments had distinct modifications. There were significant differences in the structure of the total bacterial, the ammonia oxidizing and the denitrifying bacterial communities, being that these groups responded differently to the changes in the soil. A combination of physical and chemical factors was correlated to the changes in the structures of the total bacterial communities of the soil. The changes in the structures of the functional groups follow a different pattern than the physicochemical variables. The latter might indicate a strong influence of interactions among different bacterial groups in the N cycle, emphasizing the importance of biological factors in the structuring of these communities.
   Conclusion: Sugarcane land use significantly impacted the structure of total selected soil bacterial communities and ammonia oxidizing and denitrifier gene diversities in a Cerrado field site in Central Brazil. A high impact of land use was observed in soil under the common burnt cane management. The green cane soil also presented different profiles compared to the control soil, but to at a lesser degree.

TI  - Changes of soil nitrate accumulation and the abundance and structure of nitrogen cycling microbial communities during long-term solar greenhouse vegetable cultivation
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - PurposeSolar greenhouses are the most important vegetable production systems in the Loess Plateau, northwestern China. Serious environmental concerns arise from the excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer in solar greenhouse. To decipher the changes of nitrate (NO3--N) accumulation and the abundance and structure of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities in solar greenhouse.Materials and methodsSoil profiles (0-500 cm) were sampled in grain fields (control) and solar greenhouses with 1, 10, and 18 years of vegetable cropping. Changes in soil physicochemical properties and NO3--N accumulation, as well as the abundance of nitrifying/denitrifying functional genes and associated microbial community structure were analyzed.Results and discussionSoil pH decreased in response to continuous cropping of vegetables in solar greenhouses, whereas soil electrical conductivity and nutrient contents (e.g., total nitrogen) all increased. The amount of NO3--N accumulation in 0-500 cm soil profiles reached 1165, 2757, and 3722 kg N ha-1 in the 1-, 10-, and 18-year groups of solar greenhouses, respectively. Land-use pattern change from grain fields to solar greenhouses, the abundances of bacterial amoA gene involved in nitrification and nirS, nirK, and nosZ genes involved in denitrification increased in the whole soil profiles. There were distinct shifts in the community structures of nitrifying and denitrifying functional genes under long-term vegetable cropping, which were mainly influenced by soil pH, NO3--N, dissolved organic carbon, and electrical conductivity.ConclusionsContinuous cropping of vegetables in solar greenhouses altered soil physicochemical properties and consequently the abundance and community structure of nitrifying/denitrifying functional genes, which in turn affected nitrogen transformation. These findings provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for NO3--N accumulation in intensively nitrogen fertilized agricultural ecosystems.

TI  - Assembly mechanism and co-occurrence patterns of DNRA microbial communities and imprint of nitrate reduction in the Songhua River sediments of China's largest old industrial base
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) reduces nitrate to ammonium nitrogen instead of nitrogen gas, which is an important internal linking process of nitrogen cycle. No literature has reported the assembly mechanism of DNRA microbial communities. Here, the deep assembly mechanisms and co-occurrence patterns of DNRA microbial communities and imprint of nitrate reduction in Songhua River Basin (an inland river located in northeastern China) were studied. The DNRA potential rates were detected at six sampling sites, ranging from 0.25 +/- 0.23 to 4.22 +/- 0.61 mu mol N/L/h, accounting for 33.07% to 98.08% of the total nitrate reduction. Spearman analysis indicated that the nrfA gene abundance was significantly positively correlated with the concentration of total nitrogen (TN) in sediments (p < 0.05), suggesting that nutrient inputs may enhance the metabolic potential of DNRA bacteria. Co-occurrence network and Spearman correlation analyses showed that the DNRA rates were significantly correlated with the abundance of keystone species, but not with the dominant genera (p < 0.05). Variance partitioning analysis (VPA) revealed that sediment physicochemical properties and spatial factors explained only 21.07% and 14.51% of the DNRA community variation. Null model and neutral community model both revealed stochastic processes play a major role in shaping DNRA microbial community structure. The drift was the most important process, explaining 36.36% of the community variation, followed by homogeneous selection and homogenizing dispersal, which accounted for 27.27% and 22.73%, respectively. Additionally, Geobacteraceae played an important role in DNRA and the entire bacterial community in Songhua River. This study explored the underestimated DNRA process and the deep community assembly mechanisms, which will contribute to understanding nitrate conversion and the impact of nitrogen pollution on microbial communities of river sediments in cold regions.

TI  - Effect of warming and drought on grassland microbial communities
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - The soil microbiome is responsible for mediating key ecological processes; however, little is known about its sensitivity to climate change. Observed increases in global temperatures and alteration to rainfall patterns, due to anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases, will likely have a strong influence on soil microbial communities and ultimately the ecosystem services they provide. Therefore, it is vital to understand how soil microbial communities will respond to future climate change scenarios. To this end, we surveyed the abundance, diversity and structure of microbial communities over a 2-year period from a long-term in situ warming experiment that experienced a moderate natural drought. We found the warming treatment and soil water budgets strongly influence bacterial population size and diversity. In normal precipitation years, the warming treatment significantly increased microbial population size 40-150% but decreased diversity and significantly changed the composition of the community when compared with the unwarmed controls. However during drought conditions, the warming treatment significantly reduced soil moisture thereby creating unfavorable growth conditions that led to a 50-80% reduction in the microbial population size when compared with the control. Warmed plots also saw an increase in species richness, diversity and evenness; however, community composition was unaffected suggesting that few phylotypes may be active under these stressful conditions. Our results indicate that under warmed conditions, ecosystem water budget regulates the abundance and diversity of microbial populations and that rainfall timing is critical at the onset of drought for sustaining microbial populations.

TI  - Carbon cycling in a tidal freshwater marsh ecosystem: a carbon gas flux study
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - A process-based carbon gas flux model was developed to calculate total macrophyte and microalgal production, and community and belowground respiration, for a Peltandra virginica dominated tidal freshwater marsh in Virginia. The model was based on measured field fluxes of CO2 and CH,, scaled to monthly and annual rates using empirically derived photosynthesis versus irradiance, and respiration versus temperature relationships. Because the gas exchange technique measures whole system gas fluxes and therefore includes turnover and seasonal translocation, estimates of total macrophyte production will be more accurate than those calculated from biomass harvests. One Limitation of the gas flux method is that gaseous carbon fluxes out of the sediment may underestimate true belowground respiration if sediment-produced gases are transported through plant tissues to the atmosphere. Therefore we measured gross nitrogen mineralization (converted to carbon units using sediment C/N ratios and estimates of bacterial growth efficiency) as a proxy for belowground carbon respiration. We estimated a total net macrophyte production of 536 to 715 g C m(-2) yr(-1), with an additional 59 g C m(-2) yr(-1) fixed by sediment microalgae. Belowground respiration calculated from nitrogen mineralization was estimated to range from 516 to 323 g C m(-2) yr(-1) versus 75 g C m(-2) yr(-1) measured directly with sediment chambers. Methane flux (72 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) accounted for 11 to 13 % of total belowground respiration. Gas flux results were combined with biomass harvest and Literature data to create a conceptual mass balance model of macrophyte-influenced carbon cycling. Spring and autumn translocation and re-translocation are critical in controlling observed seasonal patterns of above and belowground biomass accumulation. Annually, a total of 270 to 477 g C m(-2) of macrophyte tissue is available for deposition on the marsh surface as detritus or export from the marsh as particulate or dissolved carbon.

TI  - Experimental warming and permafrost thaw decrease soil nematode abundance in northern palsa peatlands
T2  - WEB ECOLOGY
AB  - Global warming is profoundly impacting northern ecosystems, particularly those underlain by permafrost. Permafrost-affected peat plateaus, called palsa peatlands, consist of mounds with peat and mineral soil covering ice lenses. When permafrost thaws, palsas can collapse and undergo significant hydrological changes to form wet mires. This affects the physical structure of the soil and as a result, the communities of soil-dwelling organisms, such as nematodes. Although the role of nematodes in carbon cycling is not fully understood, they can influence greenhouse gas emissions through interactions with plants and microbes. This study examined the effects of palsa degradation and experimental warming on nematode feeding guilds (bacterivores, fungivores, root feeders, and omni-carnivores) in northern Norway, where permafrost is rapidly thawing. Our findings showed that intact, vegetated palsas supported higher abundances of all nematode feeding guilds. With warming, bacterivorous and omni-carnivorous nematodes were negatively affected. Additionally, we observed a shift in dominance of bacterivores to fungivores over the summer, suggesting a temporal shift in the predominant decomposition pathway. No direct relationships were found between changes in any of the guild abundances and measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes. This study highlights the fact that expected warming and the degradation of palsas may have varied but had predominantly negative impacts on different nematode feeding guilds. Given the role of soil nematodes in nutrient cycling and other soil processes, their decline under warmer conditions could have ecosystem-level consequences in these palsa peatlands.

TI  - Long-term nitrogen enrichment accelerates soil respiration by boosting microbial biomass in coastal wetlands
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Coastal wetlands are essential in terrestrial carbon balance because they act as natural "blue carbon" sinks, influenced by anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment. N enrichment alters soil environment and plant growth, impacting carbon loss through soil respiration (Rsoil). However, the responses of Rsoil to N enrichment remain elusive in coastal wetlands, hindering the estimation of carbon fluxes. To bridge this knowledge gap, we used an 8-year field N fertilization platform in the coastal wetlands of the Yellow River Delta, China, to measure Rsoil composed of heterotrophic respiration and autotrophic respiration, and multiple indicators of soil properties, microbial activities, and plant growth. We found long-term N enrichment increased Rsoil by 26.6 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- standard deviation) and quadrupled microbial biomass carbon, accounting for 26.9 +/- 1.2% of the increase in heterotrophic respiration. In addition, N enrichment boosted plant growth, increasing the above-ground biomass by 28.7 +/- 6.9% while inducing a cooling effect that partly offsets the increase in autotrophic respiration. In particular, N enrichment elevated soil temperature sensitivity of Rsoil with the increase of N levels, suggesting that the nutrient-related control of Rsoil responds to warming. The study indicates that N enrichment stimulates Rsoil in coastal wetlands by boosting microbial biomass carbon through interactions between soil environmental conditions and plant growth. These results have implications for predicting the carbon cycle with anthropogenic N enrichment.

TI  - Spatially explicit estimate of nitrogen effects on soil respiration across the globe
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil respiration (Rs), as the second largest flux of carbon dioxide (CO2) between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, is vulnerable to global nitrogen (N) enrichment. However, the global distribution of the N effects on Rs remains uncertain. Here, we compiled a new database containing 1282 observations of Rs and its heterotrophic component (Rh) in field N manipulative experiments from 317 published papers. Using this up-to-date database, we first performed a formal meta-analysis to explore the responses of Rs and Rh to N addition, and then presented a global spatially explicit quantification of the N effects using a Random Forest model. Our results showed that experimental N addition significantly increased Rs but had a minimal impact on Rh, not supporting the prevailing view that N enrichment inhibits soil microbial respiration. For the major biomes, the magnitude of N input was the main determinant of the spatial variation in Rs response, while the most important predictors for Rh response were biome specific. Based on the key predictors, global mapping visually demonstrated a positive N effect in the regions with higher anthropogenic N inputs (i.e., atmospheric N deposition and agricultural fertilization). Overall, our analysis not only provides novel insight into the N effects on soil CO2 fluxes, but also presents a spatially explicit assessment of the N effects at the global scale, which are pivotal for understanding ecosystem carbon dynamics in future scenarios with more frequent anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Detection of methanogenic Archaea in peat:: comparison of PCR primers targeting the mcrA gene
T2  - RESEARCH IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Methanogens (domain Archaea) have a unique role in the carbon cycle as producers of the greenhouse gas methane (CH(4)). Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is a vital enzyme in CH(4) production, and the mcrA gene coding for a subunit of MCR has been employed as a specific marker for the detection and differentiation of methanogen communities. A critical step in assessing environmental mcrA diversity is the selection of PCR primers. The objective of this study was to compare the diversity coverage of three published mcrA primer sets MCR, ME and ML (also known as MCR and Luton-mcrA) and their ability to discern methanogen communities in a drained peatland. The primers were applied to DNA extracts from unfertilised and ash-fertilised peat from two different depths. Amplified mcrA communities were cloned and sequenced, and the sequences were divided into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analysis. All primers recovered characteristic OTUs associated with the peat depths and treatments and confirmed a previous observation of low methanogen diversity. The minor differences in OTU ranges of the primers did not greatly affect the observed community composition. However, as the proportions of several OTUs varied strongly, the primers provided different quantitative representations of mcrA communities. We concluded that the ML and MCR primers had better amplification ranges than the ME set, but the use of MCR with peat samples was problematic due to poor amplification. Consequently, the ML primers were best suited for mcrA analysis of peatland methanogen communities. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI  - Addition of base cations increases microbial carbon use efficiency and biomass in acidic soils
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The leaching of base cations in acidic soils can result in calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) deficiencies, which are important for microbial cell function. We aimed to determine if microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were limited in acidic soils due to a lack of base cations. Microbial CUE across a range of agricultural soils (n = 970; pHCa 3.4-7.9) treated with either deionised H2O (control) or a solution of 300 mM CaCl2 + 300 mM MgCl2 (+Base cations) was determined using a14C radioisotope tracer approach. Our results showed that the addition of base cations significantly increased microbial CUE (by up to 20%) at pHCa < 4.7; which coincided with a steep increase in exchangeable acidity. Base cation addition significantly increased MBC in nil-limed soils (pHCa 4.6) from 494 mg C kg-1 to 769 mg C kg-1 when plant residue was added, but not in limed soils (pHCa 6.2). Our findings indicate that the addition of base cations to highly acidic soils can increase microbial growth, thus aiding with carbon sequestration in these agricultural soils.

TI  - Data-driven quantification of nitrogen enrichment impact on Northern Hemisphere plant biomass
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - The production of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (N) has grown so much in the last century that quantifying the effect of N enrichment on plant growth has become a central question for carbon (C) cycle research. Numerous field experiments generally found that N enrichment increased site-scale plant biomass, although the magnitude of the response and sign varied across experiments. We quantified the response of terrestrial natural vegetation biomass to N enrichment in the Northern Hemisphere (>30 degrees N) by scaling up data from 773 field observations (142 sites) of the response of biomass to N enrichment using machine-learning algorithms. N enrichment had a significant and nonlinear effect on aboveground biomass (AGB), but a marginal effect on belowground biomass. The most influential variables on the AGB response were the amount of N applied, mean biomass before the experiment, the treatment duration and soil phosphorus availability. From the machine learning models, we found that N enrichment due to increased atmospheric N deposition during 1993-2010 has enhanced total biomass by 1.1 +/- 0.3 Pg C, in absence of losses from harvest and disturbances. The largest effect of N enrichment on plant growth occurred in northeastern Asia, where N deposition markedly increased. These estimates were similar to the range of values provided by state-of-the-art C-N ecosystem process models. This work provides data-driven insights into hemisphere-scale N enrichment effect on plant biomass growth, which allows to constrain the terrestrial ecosystem process model used to predict future terrestrial C storage.

TI  - Six-year monitoring of pine ectomycorrhizal biomass under a temperate monsoon climate indicates significant annual fluctuations in relation to climatic factors
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Ectomycorrhizas (EM) are among the most active components of forest soil biomass because they represent the dominant soil carbon efflux from forests. However, temporal patterns of EM biomass in relation to climatic factors and host tree growth remain unclear. We sampled EM and fine roots of pine each month for 6 years (May 2003 to June 2009) in a 40-50-year-old Pinus densiflora forest in Japan. Tree ring width of host pines in the plot was measured to assess the chronological sequence of annual tree growth. EM biomass was not stable during the 6 years of monitoring and seasonal patterns were indistinct. Multiple correlation analyses revealed that the autumn precipitation in the previous year was the most determinative factor of EM biomass in the current year, with a negative correlation. In contrast, tree ring width generally showed a stable annual growth pattern throughout the monitoring period. Clarification of such a carbon allocation pattern is important in understanding forest carbon dynamics under a temperate monsoon climate.

TI  - Metagenomics reveals combined effects of microplastics and antibiotics on microbial community structure and function in coastal sediments
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB  - Microplastics and antibiotics are emerging pollutants in marine environments, yet their combined effects on coastal sediments remain poorly understood. This study examined the impacts of microplastics and antibiotics on sediment properties and microbial communities through a 60-day laboratory simulation. Results showed that microplastics significantly reduced carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus levels in sediments, while both antibiotics and combined pollution decreased phosphorus content. Combined pollution also increased NH4+-N concentration. Enzyme activity analysis revealed that microplastics elevated alkaline phosphatase activity, antibiotics increased fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase activity but decreased urease activity, and their combination further enhanced FDA hydrolase activity. Metagenomics analysis demonstrated that the presence of microplastics and antibiotics altered microbial community structure and metabolic functions. The dominant phylum Pseudomonadota (42.62 %-56.24 %) showed reduced abundance under combined pollution. Antibiotics significantly increased resistance gene abundance, while combined pollution led to selective enrichment of these genes. Both pollutants inhibited ammonia assimilation, and antibiotics also suppressed dissimilatory nitrate reduction. Conversely, combined pollution promoted nitrification and nitrogen fixation. While microplastics and antibiotics inhibited methane synthesis, combined pollution increased methane production via elevated mttB and hdrA genes. Antibiotics also reduced methane-oxidizing bacteria and genes, suppressing methane oxidation. These findings provide crucial insights into the ecological impacts of microplastics and antibiotics on coastal sediments, offering a theoretical basis for future marine pollution management strategies.

TI  - Perspective on reactive nitrogen in a global, Asian and Indian context
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - Reactive nitrogen (Nr) includes the inorganic (NH3, NH4+, NOx, HNO3, N2O, NO3-) and organic forms (urea, amines, proteins, nucleic acids) that readily participate in various reactions of the global N cycle. Over the last half a century, anthropogenic perturbations of the natural N cycle have led to the increasing accumulation of inorganic Nr in the soil, water and air, intentionally through agriculture and unintentionally through fossil-fuel consumption and other activities, adversely affecting human health, biodiversity, environment and climate change. One of the major emerging challenges of this century will be to ensure adequate availability of Nr inputs for agriculture and other activities, while preventing their unwanted accumulation. This article provides an overall perspective of the emerging issues related to Nr in the global, Asian and Indian contexts.

TI  - Microbial resistance and resilience to drought and rewetting modulate soil N2O emissions with different fertilizers
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Future climate models indicate an enhanced severity of regional drought and frequent rewetting events, which may cause cascading impacts on soil nitrogen cycle and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but the underlying microbial mechanism remains largely unknown. Here we report an incubation study that examined the impacts of soil moisture status and nitrification inhibitor (DCD) on the N2O-producers and N2O-reducers following the application of urea and composted swine manure in an acid soil. The soil moisture treatments included 100 % water-holding capacity (WHC) (wetting, 35.3 % gravimetric soil water content), 40 % WHC (drought, 7 % gravimetric soil water content), and 40 % to 100 % WHC (rewetting). The results showed that N2O emissions were significantly decreased under drought conditions and were significantly increased after rewetting. The resistance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nosZII, which was inhibited by urea or manure application, modulated N2O emissions under drought conditions. The resilience of the functional guilds modulated their dominant role in N2O emissions with rewetting. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nirS-type denitrifying bacteria and nosZI showed significant resilience in response to rewetting. Significant negative relationships were observed between N2O emissions and nosZII clade under wetting condition and between N2O emissions and nosZI clade after rewetting. Our results highlighted the importance of microbial resistance and resilience in modulating N2O emissions, which help to better understand the dominant way of N2O emissions, and consequently make efficient mitigation strategies under the global climate change.

TI  - Accelerated gross nitrogen cycling following garlic mustard invasion is linked with abiotic and biotic changes to soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - IntroductionAlliaria petiolata (garlic mustard), an invasive forest herb in North America, often alters nutrient availability in its non-native ecosystems, but the mechanisms driving these changes have yet to be determined. We hypothesized three potential mechanisms through which garlic mustard could directly influence soil nitrogen (N) cycling: by increasing soil pH, by modifying soil microbial community composition, and by altering nutrient availability through litter inputs. Materials and methodsTo test these hypotheses, we evaluated garlic mustard effects on soil pH and other soil properties; fungal and prokaryotic (bacterial and archaeal) community composition; and soil N cycling rates (gross N mineralization and nitrification rates, microbial N assimilation rates, and nitrification- versus denitrification-derived nitrous oxide fluxes); and we assessed correlations among these variables. We collected soil samples from garlic mustard present, absent, and removed treatments in eight forests in central Illinois, United States, during the rosette, flowering, and senescence phenological stages of garlic mustard life cycle. ResultsWe found that garlic mustard increased soil pH, altered fungal and prokaryotic communities, and increased rates of N mineralization, nitrification, nitrification-derived net N2O emission. Significant correlations between soil pH and microbial community composition suggest that garlic mustard effects on soil pH could both directly and indirectly influence soil N cycling rates. DiscussionCorrespondence of gross rates of N mineralization and nitrification with microbial community composition suggest that garlic mustard modification of soil microbial communities could directly lead to changes in soil N cycling. We had expected that early season, nutrient-rich litter inputs from mortality of young garlic mustard could accelerate gross N mineralization and microbial N assimilation whereas late season, nutrient poorer litter inputs from senesced garlic mustard could suppress N mineralization, but we did not observe these patterns in support of the litter input mechanism. Together, our results elucidate how garlic mustard effects on soil pH and microbial community composition can accelerate soil N cycling to potentially contribute to the invasion success of garlic mustard.

TI  - Alterations in soil pH emerge as a key driver of the impact of global change on soil microbial nitrogen cycling: Evidence from a global meta-analysis
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - AimSoil nitrogen (N) cycling is critical to the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the impact of global change factors (GCFs) on the microbial mediators of N cycling pathways has yet to be synthesized, and it also remains unclear whether the response of the abundance of N-cycling genes can predict changes in their corresponding processes. LocationGlobal. Time period2000-2021. Major taxa studiedArchaea, bacteria. MethodsWe synthesized 8322 paired observations of soil microorganisms related to N cycling from field experiments in which GCFs (climate change and nutrient addition) were manipulated. ResultsWe found that the abundance of soil microbes and most N-cycling genes were resistant to elevated CO2, experimental warming and water addition/reduction; however, N addition and the combination of N addition with other GCFs significantly increased the abundance of ammonia oxidizer bacteria (amoA-AOB). The results indicated that in steady-state (natural) conditions, the main factors driving the global abundance of soil bacteria, archaea and N-cycling genes varied in terms of the contributions of climatic and edaphic factors. However, upon manipulation of GCFs, the induced change in soil pH was the most essential factor associated with changes in the abundance of soil microbes and N-cycling genes. Notably, the changes in ammonia-oxidizing archaea (amoA-AOA) and amoA-AOB genes, in addition to genes involved in denitrification (nirS and nirK), were significantly correlated with the rates of their corresponding processes, but GCF-induced shifts in the potential nitrification rate (PNR) were explained well by changes in the abundance of the amoA-AOB gene under GCFs. Main conclusionsOur study highlights how ongoing GCFs impact the abundance of soil microbes and N-cycling genes, which might have a profound impact on terrestrial N cycling. Our field-based results provide new insights into the drivers of the abundance of soil microbes and N-cycling genes.

TI  - Microbial models with data-driven parameters predict stronger soil carbon responses to climate change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Long-term carbon (C) cycle feedbacks to climate depend on the future dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC). Current models show low predictive accuracy at simulating contemporary SOC pools, which can be improved through parameter estimation. However, major uncertainty remains in global soil responses to climate change, particularly uncertainty in how the activity of soil microbial communities will respond. To date, the role of microbes in SOC dynamics has been implicitly described by decay rate constants in most conventional global carbon cycle models. Explicitly including microbial biomass dynamics into C cycle model formulations has shown potential to improve model predictive performance when assessed against global SOC databases. This study aimed to data-constrained parameters of two soil microbial models, evaluate the improvements in performance of those calibrated models in predicting contemporary carbon stocks, and compare the SOC responses to climate change and their uncertainties between microbial and conventional models. Microbial models with calibrated parameters explained 51% of variability in the observed total SOC, whereas a calibrated conventional model explained 41%. The microbial models, when forced with climate and soil carbon input predictions from the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), produced stronger soil C responses to 95 years of climate change than any of the 11 CMIP5 models. The calibrated microbial models predicted between 8% (2-pool model) and 11% (4-pool model) soil C losses compared with CMIP5 model projections which ranged from a 7% loss to a 22.6% gain. Lastly, we observed unrealistic oscillatory SOC dynamics in the 2-pool microbial model. The 4-pool model also produced oscillations, but they were less prominent and could be avoided, depending on the parameter values.

TI  - Response of Community Composition of Denitrifying Bacteria to Long-Term Fertilization in Alfisol Soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - PurposeDenitrification is an important process in the nitrogen cycle and is also one of the main processes causing N2O greenhouse gas emissions and soil nitrogen loss. The nirK, nirS and nosZ genotypes of denitrifying microorganisms play a key role in this process. This study determined the effects of long-term fertilization on nirK, nirS and nosZ expression in the denitrifying microbial community and the denitrification potential in Alfisol soil in Shenyang, China.MethodsFive long-term fertilization regimes were implemented, including no fertilizer (CK); chemical N fertilizer (N); chemical N, P and K fertilizers (NPK); recycled organic manure (M); and combined application of chemical N, P, K and recycled manure (MNPK). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Illumina MiSeq sequencing were applied to assess the abundance and composition of denitrifying microorganisms.ResultsThe results showed that different long-term fertilization regimes had a significant impact on the number and community structure of the denitrifying microbial community. The nitrate nitrogen content and water content were the main influencing factors of nirS and nirK gene expression, and total phosphorus content was the main influencing factor of nosZ gene expression. After long-term application of nitrogen fertilizer, the relative Pseudomonas abundance decreased, while those of Nitrosospira and Azoarcus increased.ConclusionAfter long-term application of chemical fertilizers, the denitrification potential of soil can be improved by increasing the number of denitrifying microorganisms and improving the synergistic effect between different genotypes of denitrifying microorganisms.

TI  - Impact of land use and soil group on the functional diversity of abundant and rare bacterial communities
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Despite the critical role of soil microbial communities in biomass production and ecosystem functioning, previous research primarily focussed on microbial structure without functional insights, especially for rare species. This study addresses this gap by exploring the functional potential of both abundant and rare bacterial communities across various land uses and soil groups in the Lower Namoi Valley, Australia. By integrating plant-beneficial bacteria (PBB) and Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) databases, we show that rare species exhibited higher alpha diversity and multifunctionality than abundant species. Cropping enhanced the biodiversity of abundant functional bacteria in fine-textured soils, which promoted crop growth through increased PBB and carbon cycling. Conversely, rare functional bacteria exhibited consistently lower biodiversity in croplands. Random forest models and linear regression analyses identified land use as a significant factor influencing the biodiversity of rare functional bacterial communities, likely through plant-soil feedback systems. These findings underline the importance of land use in shaping bacterial community functionality and call for conservation strategies to protect soil biodiversity, especially rare species, to ensure sustainable soil ecosystems and support future food production.

TI  - Carbon Dioxide Emission from Soils of Southern Tundra Ecosystems in the Northeast of the Russian Plain (Vorkuta Area)
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - As a result of the research performed, the emission of CO2 from soils in the southern tundra ecosystems of the northeastern Russian Plain has been estimated using the example of the environs of Vorkuta. The soil cover of the studied area is presented by Histic Turbic Cryosol, Histic Reductaquic Glacic Cryosol, Reductaquic Glacic Cryosol, and Reductaquic Glacic Cryosol. Atypically high values of CO2 emission from soils [2.13 +/- 0.13 g C/(m2 day)] were largely due to the weather of the 2022 growing season: high air temperatures and low precipitation. About 60% of the variability in the emission value was due to the content of microbial biomass carbon and extractable soil carbon, temperature, and soil moisture. High spatial variation in the content of extractable carbon and microbial biomass carbon and parameters of hydrothermal regime of soils was found. The soils were characterized by low values of extractable organic carbon and soil microbial biomass carbon (224 +/- 18 and 873 +/- 73 mg C/kg of soil, respectively). The thickness of organic horizon of soil determines 72% of variability in the content of microbial biomass carbon and 79% of variability in the content of extractable carbon. Regular measurements of CO2 emissions from soils of tundra ecosystems in the northeast of the Russian Plain should obtain special attention, as this will improve the accuracy of assessing the global greenhouse gas flows.

TI  - Biodiversity drives ecosystem multifunctionality in sandy grasslands?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Plant communities and soil microbiomes play a crucial role in regulating ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). However, whether and how aboveground plant diversity, belowground soil microbial diversity and interactions with environmental factors affect EMF in sandy grasslands under climate change conditions is unclear. Here, we selected 15 typical grassland communities from the Horqin sandy grassland along temperature and precipitation gradients, using the mean annual temperature (AMT), mean annual precipitation (AP), soil temperature (ST), soil water content (SW) and pH as abiotic factors, and plant diversity (P-D) and soil microbial diversity (S-D) as biodiversity indicators. The effects of biodiversity and abiotic factors on individual ecosystem functions and EMF were studied. We found that P-D and its components, plant species richness (S-R), species diversity (P-R) and genetic diversity (G(D)), had significant effects on aboveground biomass (AGB) and major factors involved in ecosystem nitrogen cycling (plant leaf nitrogen content (PLN) and soil total nitrogen content (STN)) (P < 0.05). Soil fungal diversity (F-R) has a greater impact on ecosystem function than soil bacteria (B-R) and archaea (AB(R)) in sandy grasslands and mainly promotes the accumulation of soil microbial carbon and nitrogen (MBC, MBN) (P < 0.05), STC and STN (P < 0.01). P-D and two types of S-D (F-R and AB(R)) significantly regulated EMF (P < 0.01). Among the abiotic factors, soil pH and SW regulated EMF (P < 0.05), and SW and ST directly drove EMF (P < 0.05). P-D drove EMF significantly and indirectly (positively) through soil pH and ST (P < 0.001), while S-D drove EMF weakly and indirectly (negatively) through AP and P-D (P > 0.05). P-D was a stronger driving force on EMF than S-D. These results improve our understanding of the drivers of multifunctionality in sandy grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Microbial community assembly and metabolic function during mammalian corpse decomposition
T2  - SCIENCE
AB  - Vertebrate corpse decomposition provides an important stage in nutrient cycling in most terrestrial habitats, yet microbially mediated processes are poorly understood. Here we combine deep microbial community characterization, community-level metabolic reconstruction, and soil biogeochemical assessment to understand the principles governing microbial community assembly during decomposition of mouse and human corpses on different soil substrates. We find a suite of bacterial and fungal groups that contribute to nitrogen cycling and a reproducible network of decomposers that emerge on predictable time scales. Our results show that this decomposer community is derived primarily from bulk soil, but key decomposers are ubiquitous in low abundance. Soil type was not a dominant factor driving community development, and the process of decomposition is sufficiently reproducible to offer new opportunities for forensic investigations.

TI  - Regulation of soil nitrogen cycling by shrubs in grasslands
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Globally, grasslands are experiencing shrub expansion, but the effects of such plant community shifts on soil N cycling are seldom investigated. We explored the spatial heterogeneity of total soil N content by grid sampling down to a soil depth of 1.2 m, and analyzed net ammonification and nitrification rates in the top 0.2 m, during the growing season, in response to the patchiness of grasses and four shrub species in a grazed meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. The delta N-15 analyses of plant, soil, and mineral N (NH4+ and NO3-) revealed differences in N absorption strategies between shrubs and grasses. Heterogeneity in the total soil N distribution was common to at least a depth of 1.2 m. The lower delta N-15 values of the 1.2 m soil profile under shrubs were consistent with the lower delta N-15 values of leaves, aboveground litter, and roots of shrubs compared to grasses, reflecting the imprint of long-term N cycling in the soil as affected by shrubs. Increases in total soil N stock in the entire 1.2 m profile by 28%-32% under non-leguminous shrubs relative to grasses were ascribed to N accumulation in the lower 0.8 m. Consequently, deep sampling is essential for accurate estimation of soil N storage in shrubby meadows. The total N stock in soil under the leguminous shrub species was similar to that under grasses, which showed that the effect of shrubification on soil N storage depends on the shrub species. Nitrification rates in the topsoil under all shrubs were greater than under grasses, producing higher N-15-depleted NO3- contents under shrubs. Therefore, the lower delta N-15 signatures of shrub tissues compared to grasses reflected a preferential or adaptive uptake of NO3- by shrubs. The expansion of shrubs in grasslands creates high heterogeneity in N cycling and storage down to a considerable soil depth.

TI  - Subsoiling tillage increased core microbiome associated with nitrogen fixation in the fallow season under rainfed maize monoculture
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Subsoiling tillage (ST) is a promising agronomy practice to improve soil physicochemical properties, soil microbial diversity during the crop growing season, and ultimately crop yield, but little is known about whether and how the ST practice will impact soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities in fallow season and their impacts on crop growth in next season. Here, a four-year continuous field experiment was conducted to compare the impacts of three tillage treatments, i.e., the ST, the no-tillage (NT), and the rotary tillage (RT), on soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities in maize fallow season. The results showed that compared with the RT treatment, the ST treatment improved maize yield by 2.3%, 4.2%, 11.4%, and 9.7% from 2018 to 2021, respectively, while there was no significant yield loss between the NT and RT. The ST treatment improved root biomass and soil available nitrogen by 25.1% and 34.0%, respectively, but scarcely impacted soil bulk density and water-filled pore space in comparison with the RT treatment in the maize fallow season in 2021. In addition, changes in root biomass further altered soil bacterial core microbiomes. Compared with the RT treatment, the ST treatment increased the relative abundance of core microbiomes related to nitrogen fixation and denitrification by 169.5% and 62.0%, respectively, but reduced the relative abundance of core microbiomes related to nitrification by 39.0%. The potential functional profile of core microbiomes predicted by the FAP-ROTAX database also showed that the ST treatment significantly improved nitrogen fixation and ureolysis by 115.9% and 346.9%, respectively, while decreased nitrification by 57.1% in comparison with the RT treatment. The results of the structural equation model showed that ST-induced changes in the function of nitrogen fixation improved soil available nitrogen content in the maize fallow season, which could supply nutrients for maize growth in the next growing season. Additionally, although the NT treatment improved microbial diversities in comparison with the RT and ST treatments, it reduced the relative abundance of microbiomes related to nitrogen cycling in the maize fallow season. These results indicate that the subsoiling tillage could increase the abundance of core microbiomes related to nitrogen fixation and mineralization, which increase soil available nitrogen content in the fallow season of maize cropping in the northeast of China.

TI  - Evaluation of agricultural soil health after applying pyraclostrobin in wheat/maize rotation field based on the response of soil microbes
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The green development of agriculture, the rational use of pesticides, and soil health are closely related. However, our understanding of them is still limited. Pyraclostrobin (PYRA) is one of the most popular strobilurin fungicides due to its broad-spectrum control of fungal diseases. However, PYRA has been shown to have negative effects on bacterial communities and soil enzyme activities under laboratory conditions. The effects of PYRA on soil mi-crobes (mainly bacteria) in actual field environments still need to be addressed. In the present study, after applying PYRA in a wheat/maize rotation field for 2 years, we determined the level of residual PYRA and assessed the soil bacterial community structure, soil enzyme activity, and ammonia-oxidizing functional gene expression. The results show that the DT50 of PYRA in agricultural soil was 2.16-38.93 days. The final residual levels of PYRA in wheat/maize grain were less than 0.01 mg kg(-1), which is lower than the maximum residue limit (MRL) recommended (0.2 mg kg(-1)) by China and the European Union. The culturable fungi and bacteria populations were significantly reduced after applying PYRA. The genera's abundance (Sphingomonas and Lyso-bacter) and urease activity associated with phosphorus cycle were inhibited. The amoA genes abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) showed that the N-cycle function of soil microbes was inhibited. Overall, applying PYRA for 2 years did not increase the negative response of soil microbes. However, in some indicators, such as culturable microorganism populations, more significant re-ductions in populations were observed in the double recommended dose group than in the recommended dose group. The results obtained in this study reflect the response of soil microbes subjected to pyraclostrobin in an actual field and provide new insights into how agricultural development influences soil health.

TI  - Sediment denitrification in Yangtze lakes is mainly influenced by environmental conditions but not biological communities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Globally, shallow lakes have suffered from excessive nitrogen (N) loading due to increased human activities in catchments, resulting in water quality degradation and aquatic biodiversity loss. Sediment denitrification, which reduces nitrate (NO3-) to N gaseous products, is the most important mechanism for permanent N removal in freshwater lakes. However, the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic factors to the sediment denitrification is highly variable. Here, we determined the unamended denitrification rate and nitrous oxide (N2O) production rate of 74 sediment samples from 22 eutrophic lakes in the Yangtze River basin. We also quantified the diversity and abundance of denitrifying communities using nirK and nirS genes. The results of variance partitioning analyses showed that water physicochemical properties (e.g., dissolved oxygen) and nutrients (e.g., NO(3)(-)concentration) but not denitrifier communities and submerged vegetation were the major factor groups predicting denitrification and N2O production rates. Path analyses further revealed that water physicochemical properties and nutrients could affect denitrification and N2O production rates both directly and indirectly, and the direct effects were considerably higher than the indirect effects mediated through changes in sediment characteristics, denitrifier communities and submerged vegetation. These findings suggest that the dominant N removal process in Yangtze lakes is largely regulated by abiotic factors rather than diversity and abundance of denitrifiers and submerged macrophytes. Additionally, the findings in this study are helpful in developing a targeted strategy to assess and enhance the N removal capability of eutrophic lakes in China. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Quantification of microbially induced soil N2O emissions by an inhibitory cocktail in mountain forest ecosystems
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Simultaneously quantifying soil N2O emissions contributed by different microbial groups and revealing the underlying mechanisms have long been challenging but fundamental to understanding terrestrial nitrogen cycling. Here, a novel inhibitory cocktail approach based on the use octyne, acetylene, antibiotics and different combinations was developed to explore different microbially sourced N2O emissions in mountain forest ecosystems. Our results indicated that the nitrification process was the pathway leading to major N2O emissions, with ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) playing a greater role than ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in soils with pH > 4.5, while AOA contributed more only in extremely acidic soils. Soil pH was identified as the key factor that regulated AOA and AOB abundances and their relative contributions. However, when the soil pH increased above 5.5, it was not the AOB abundance but the higher intrinsic N2O emission capability (INP) for AOB that could explain its dominant role. Moreover, there was an opposite pattern in the relationship between pH- intrinsic N2O emission capability from AOA and AOB, indicating its potential for assessing microbially sourced N2O emissions. Notably, we found, for the first time, that the denitrification process played nonnegligible roles in the mountain forest ecosystem, and during this process, denitrifying fungi were more powerful than denitrifying bacteria. This difference may be attributed to distinct enzymatic activities and metabolic pathways involved in N2O generation and consumption between the denitrifying fungi and bacteria. Overall, this study sheds new light on the mechanisms of microbially mediated soil N2O emissions in mountain forest ecosystems.

TI  - Exogenous carbon-to-nitrogen imbalance drives soil viral roles in microbial carbon mineralization and necromass accrual
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Viruses are integral components of soil microbial community dynamics and carbon cycling, yet their roles in modulating organic matter (OM) transformations under varying nutrient conditions remain poorly understood. This study investigates how exogenous substrate treatment carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios influence soil viral communities and their roles in microbial activities and necromass carbon accrual in soils differing in physicochemical properties, including native OM contents. A 28-day incubation experiment was conducted using glucose and NH4Cl amendments at C/N ratios of 5, 10, and 35 in soils from the Songnen and Liaohe Plains. Viromic analyses revealed that both soil properties and amendment C/N ratios significantly shaped viral diversity and composition. Notably, viral species richness and diversity were higher in LH-soils than in SN-soils and were significantly increased upon exogenous substrate addition in both soil types. In SN-soils, viral species richness declined with increasing amendment C/N ratios, coupled with shifts in viral lifestyle balances, underscoring the importance of nitrogen availability in virus-bacterial interactions. The relative abundance of temperate and virulent viruses exhibited distinct patterns associated with multiple soil properties, influencing microbial community interactions and necromass carbon accrual. Structural equation modeling (SEM) indicated divergent effects of viral communities on SOC accumulation across soils. In LH-soils, viral activity negatively associated with bacterial diversity and microbial necromass accumulation (using amino sugar biomarkers as proxies). In contrast, viral dynamics appeared to facilitate necromass incorporation into SOC in SN-soils, suggesting contextdependent viral influences on carbon sequestration. These findings highlight the critical yet nuanced roles of soil viruses in nutrient cycling and carbon storage, providing novel insights into viral ecological functions under varying nutrient and soil context conditions.

TI  - Linkages of nitrogen-cycling microbial resistance and resilience to soil nutrient stoichiometry under dry-rewetting cycles with different fertilizations and temperatures in a vegetable field
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Multiple dry-rewetting (DRW) cycles occur in intensively managed vegetable fields dueto frequent tillage and irriga-tion. Soil nitrogen (N) cycling depends on the resistance and resilience of related microbial populations to DRW cycles, which could be closely related to soil nutrient status. However, the linkage of N-cycling microbial resistance and resil-ience and soil nutrient stoichiometry remains unknown in vegetable field. Here, we established four fertilization treat-ments in a four-year greenhouse vegetable field: no N fertilization, synthesized N fertilization, substituting 50% of chemical N with organic fertilizer or biofertilizer. Then, we set up an 85-day DRW-cycling incubation at 15, 25 and 35 degrees C including a 55-day fluctuating moisture for microbial resistance and then a 30-day constant moisture for micro-bial resilience. The results showed that microbial resistance was high (resistance index = 0.87- 0.99) in response to DRW cycles, but microbial resilience was generally low (resilience index = -0.36- 0.76), especially in 50% organic substitution or 15 degrees C. N-cycling microbes showed an important trade-off between their resistance and resilience to DRW cycles. Furthermore, most treatments showed microbial carbon limitation and N abundance during DRW cycles and recovered gradually to the undisturbed state. Microbial resistance was significantly related to the soil nutrient stoi-chiometry of carbon, N and phosphorus, while microbial resilience was mainly correlated with carbon-related indica-tors. In conclusion, N-cycling microbes presented good stability with oligotrophic strategy to frequent DRW cycles, which was linked to not only the historical legacy effect of DRW cycles but also soil nutrient stoichiometry in the vegetable field.

TI  - Anammox co-fungi accompanying denitrifying bacteria are the thieves of the nitrogen cycle in paddy-wheat crop rotated soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Anammox bacteria are the key microbes after denitrifiers in the anaerobic environment. Nitrogen gap cannot be satisfied till date even with the advanced techniques, due to complex microbial network and different pathways. Recently, anaerobic fungi are the concerning point to investigate, which was previously ignored for a long time. Study was conducted with the aim of assessment of an individual and combined contribution of anammox, co-denitrification, and denitrification processes for N losses, under different organic-chemical fertilizers, i.e. 1) control _CK; 2) chemical fertilization _CF; 3) pig manure plus chemical fertilization _PMCF; and 4) straw returned plus chemical fertilization _SRCF). Hybrid techniques of C-13-DNA-Stable isotope and N-15 isotopic tracer were used to discriminate the contribution of anammox-co-fungi using antibacterial and antifungal inhibitors. Results showed that fungi are the major culprit in N losses; the overall contribution rate by anammox-co-denitrification was 14.82-29.74%. While in case of individual N losses, fungi were dominating the N losses (3.51-25.60%, AB) than bacteria (7.50-21.80%, AF). The anammox and fungi have a positive correlation with each other's (r = 0.67), principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation analysis validate each other (anammox and fungi), and both showed the same type of attraction to the soil physicochemical properties. However, fungi did not show a significant relationship with NH4+-N (r = 0.38). A clone library of C-13-DNA-SIP was constructed, and results showed that denitrifying fungi were very likely belonges to the genera Agaricus, Aspergillus, Phycomyces, Saitoella, and Trichoderma. Conclusively, we propose that fertilization pattern can change anammox activity and abundance, but fungal activity and community structure undergo changes with organic amendments rather than inorganic fertilizers.

TI  - Nature development in degraded landscapes: How pioneer bioturbators and water level control soil subsidence, nutrient chemistry and greenhouse gas emission
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - The restoration of degraded ecosystems and landscapes is challenging, because returning to the original state is often socio-economically unfeasible. A novel approach is to construct new ecosystems to improve the functioning of degraded landscapes. However, the development of novel ecosystems is largely driven by the pre-construction hydrogeophysical and ecological conditions of the soil. In Lake Markermeer, a deteriorating freshwater lake in the Netherlands, a large archipelago is currently being constructed to boost the ecological functioning of the lake. Hence, islands - with wetlands and with more elevated and dryer areas - have been created to sustain biodiversity and key biogeochemical functions such as nutrient cycling. The islands are constructed from lake-bottom sediments. To study how two potentially important drivers, water level and bioturbation, affect soil characteristics in a novel wetland ecosystem, we experimentally tested the effects of water level (-30, -10 and 5 cm), and bioturbation by earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus) and Tubifex spp. in a microcosm experiment. We demonstrate that a high water level prevents soil subsidence, soil crack formation and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and affects nitrogen cycling. In dryer soils, the presence of earthworms strongly increases CO2 emissions next to reducing soil crack formation, while Tubifex spp. in wetter soils hardly affect soil characteristics. Our findings highlight the important roles of both water level and bioturbation for the functioning of novel soils, which likely affects vegetation development in novel ecosystems. This knowledge can be used to aid the construction and nature development of novel wetlands.

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon cycling, methane emissions and related microbial populations in temperate rice paddies with contrasting straw and water management
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Rice cultivation is recognised as a pivotal source of atmospheric methane (CH4), accounting for 11% of global emissions. The main drivers of CH4 production are redox conditions of soil, substrate availability, and abundance of methanogenic archaea, all potentially governed by management practices for straw and water management. In the present study, we combined crop residue and water management practices aimed at limiting substrate availability and reducing soil conditions required for methanogenesis, and tested their efficiency for mitigating CH4 emission in a field trial conducted on a long-term experimental platform. Combined straw and water management practices (i.e. the early crop residue incorporation, AUT, the adoption of dry with respect to water seeding, DRY, and the straw removal, REM) were effective in reducing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, methanogenic abundances and overall CH4 fluxes, with respect to the typical technique adopted in the Italian rice district that involves spring incorporation of straw and water seeding (SPR). The latter treatment enhanced substrate availability as well as favoured methanogenic archaea abundances and resulted in the highest CH4 fluxes and cumulative emissions. Treatments AUT and REM showed similar behaviours, reducing emissions of SPR by 48% and 46%, respectively. The highest mitigation efficiency was obtained by DRY that reduced emissions by 69% as a result of the oxic soil conditions during the early vegetative stage, the decreased substrate availability with the onset of field flooding, and the lower abundance of methanogenic communities.

TI  - Global change, soil biodiversity, and nitrogen cycling in terrestrial ecosystems: three case studies
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The relative contribution of different soil organism groups to nutrient cycling has been quantified for a number of ecosystems. Some functions, particularly within the N-cycle, are carried out by very specific organisms. Others, including those of decomposition and nutrient release from organic inputs are, however, mediated by a diverse group of bacteria, protozoa, fungi and invertebrate animals. Many authors have hypothesized that there is a high degree of equivalence and flexibility in function within this decomposer community and thence a substantial extent of redundancy in species richness and resilience in functional capacity. Three case studies are presented to examine the relationship between soil biodiversity and nitrogen cycling under global change in ecosystem types from three latitudes, i.e. tundra, temperate grassland and tropical rainforest.
   In all three ecosystems evidence exists for the potential impact of global change factors (temperature change, COP enrichment, land-use-change) on the composition and diversity of the soil community as well as on various aspects of the nitrogen and other cycles. There is, however, very little unequivocal evidence of direct causal linkage between species richness and nutrient cycling efficiency. Most of the changes detected are shifts in the influence of major functional groups of the soil biota (e.g. between microflora and fauna in decomposition). There seem to be few data, however, from which to judge the significance of changes in diversity within functional groups. Nonetheless the soil biota are hypothesized to be a sensitive link between plant detritus and the availability of nutrients to plant uptake. Any factors affecting the quantity or quality of plant detritus is likely to change this link. Rigorous experimentation on the relationships between soil species richness and the regulation or resilience of nutrient cycles under global change thus remains a high priority.

TI  - Global patterns and associated drivers of priming effect in response to nutrient addition
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Priming effect (PE) induced by inputs of fresh carbon plays crucial roles in soil organic matter decomposition and terrestrial carbon cycling. Priming effect is considered to be largely influenced by nutrient availability, but the global-scale patterns reflecting how nutrient addition affects PE and the controlling factors for such effects remain unclear. By conducting a meta-analysis of 355 observations from 71 studies worldwide, we explored the global patterns and associated drivers of PE responding to nutrient addition. Results showed that, overall, nitrogen (N) and nitrogen plus phosphorus (NP) addition significantly decreased PE, whereas phosphorus (P) addition had minimal effect on PE (P > 0.05). The effects of N and NP addition on PE varied with ecosystem, experiment and carbon substrate types. Specifically, N and NP addition generally decreased PE in forest and grassland, but did not change PE in cropland. Among experiment types, such negative effects occurred in incubation experiments, but not in pot experiments. Between carbon substrate forms (i.e., containing the added nutrient or not), N and NP addition only decreased PE in groups of carbon substrates that did not contain the added mineral nutrient. Moreover, the effect of N addition on PE depended primarily on the N limitation of microbial respiration across sties, with such effect increasing significantly with microbial N limitation (indicated by microbial respiration response to N addition and C:N imbalance between microbes and resources). Based on this relationship, we proposed a conceptual model linking microbial N mining and stoichiometric decomposition hypotheses, in which the former dominates in soils with less microbial N limitation and the latter dominates in soils with relatively higher microbial N limitation. Our findings imply that N deposition may benefit soil carbon sequestration via suppressing PE, and highlight the need for field studies investigating the effects of nutrient addition on PE in the rhizosphere and in the subsoil.

TI  - Soil networks become more connected and take up more carbon as nature restoration progresses
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Soil organisms have an important role in aboveground community dynamics and ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems. However, most studies have considered soil biota as a black box or focussed on specific groups, whereas little is known about entire soil networks. Here we show that during the course of nature restoration on abandoned arable land a compositional shift in soil biota, preceded by tightening of the belowground networks, corresponds with enhanced efficiency of carbon uptake. In mid-and long-term abandoned field soil, carbon uptake by fungi increases without an increase in fungal biomass or shift in bacterial-to-fungal ratio. The implication of our findings is that during nature restoration the efficiency of nutrient cycling and carbon uptake can increase by a shift in fungal composition and/or fungal activity. Therefore, we propose that relationships between soil food web structure and carbon cycling in soils need to be reconsidered.

TI  - The role of lignin and cellulose in the carbon-cycling of degraded soils under semiarid climate and their relation to microbial biomass
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - A high level of biological degradation is usually observed in soils under semiarid climate where the low inputs of vegetal debris constraint the development of microbiota. Among vegetal inputs, cellulose and lignin are dominant substrates but their assimilation by the microbial community of semiarid soils is yet not understood. In the present study, C-13-labeled cellulose and C-13-labeled lignin (75 mu g C-13 g(-1) soil) were added to two semiarid soils with different properties and degradation level. Abanilla soil is a bare, highly degraded soil without plant cover growing on it and a total organic C content of 5.0 g kg(-1); Santomera soil is covered by plants (20% coverage) based on xerophytic shrubs and has a total organic C content of 12.0 g kg(-1). The fate of added carbon was evaluated by analysis of the carbon isotope signature of bulk soil-derived carbon and extractable carbon fractions (water and sodium-pyrophosphate extracts). At long-term (120 days), we observed that the stability of cellulose- and lignin-derived carbon was dependent on their chemical nature. The contribution of lignin-derived carbon to the pool of humic substances was higher than that of cellulose. However, at short-term (30 days), the mineralization of the added substrates was more related to the degradation level of soils (i.e. microbial biomass). Stable isotope probing (SIP) of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA-SIP) analysis revealed that just a minor part of the microbial community assimilated the carbon derived from cellulose and lignin. Moreover, the relative contribution of each microbial group to the assimilation of lignin-derived carbon was different in each soil. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Plant Invasions Associated with Change in Root-Zone Microbial Community Structure and Diversity
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The importance of plant-microbe associations for the invasion of plant species have not been often tested under field conditions. The research sought to determine patterns of change in microbial communities associated with the establishment of invasive plants with different taxonomic and phenetic traits. Three independent locations in Virginia, USA were selected. One site was invaded by a grass (Microstegium vimineum), another by a shrub (Rhamnus davurica), and the third by a tree (Ailanthus altissima). The native vegetation from these sites was used as reference. 16S rRNA and ITS regions were sequenced to study root-zone bacterial and fungal communities, respectively, in invaded and non-invaded samples and analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME). Though root-zone microbial community structure initially differed across locations, plant invasion shifted communities in similar ways. Indicator species analysis revealed that Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) closely related to Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Ascomycota increased in abundance due to plant invasions. The Hyphomonadaceae family in the Rhodobacterales order and ammonia-oxidizing Nitrospirae phylum showed greater relative abundance in the invaded root-zone soils. Hyphomicrobiaceae, another bacterial family within the phyla Proteobacteria increased as a result of plant invasion, but the effect associated most strongly with root-zones of M. vimineum and R. davurica. Functional analysis using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) showed bacteria responsible for nitrogen cycling in soil increased in relative abundance in association with plant invasion. In agreement with phylogenetic and functional analyses, greater turnover of ammonium and nitrate was associated with plant invasion. Overall, bacterial and fungal communities changed congruently across plant invaders, and support the hypothesis that nitrogen cycling bacteria and functions are important factors in plant invasions. Whether the changes in microbial communities are driven by direct plant microbial interactions or a result of plant-driven changes in soil properties remains to be determined.

TI  - Effects of herbicide mixtures on the diversity and composition of microbial community and nitrogen cycling function on agricultural soil: A field experiment in Northeast China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Herbicide mixtures application is a widespread and effective practice in modern agriculture; however, a knowledge gap exists regarding the potential ecotoxicological effects of herbicide mixtures in agricultural systems. Here, the effects of various doses of herbicide mixtures (atrazine, nicosulfuron, and mesotrione) under different varieties of maize cultivation on the structure and function of microbial communities and soil chemical parameters were clarified through field experiments. The results showed that the application of herbicide mixtures increased the bacterial and fungal community alpha diversity at jointing and maturity, indicating a prolonged effect of the herbicide mixtures. Moreover, herbicide mixtures alter the composition of bacterial and fungal communities, with sensitive taxa suppressed and herbicide-tolerant taxa enriched. The herbicide mixtures significantly reduced the abundances of Bacillus even at lower doses, but Penicillum was enriched. FAPROTAX analysis and quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed that herbicide mixtures inhibited the soil nitrogen-cycle process and related genes AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, and nifH at maize seedling stage. Moreover, network analysis showed that low concentrations of the herbicide mixtures increased bacterial interactions while high concentrations inhibited them, which indicated that the network complexity may be herbicide concentration dependent. A synthetic community (SynCom) consisting of six bacterial strains was established for the biodegradation of the herbicide mixtures based on the analysis of the bacterial network, which resulted in an increase in the degradation efficiency of nicosulfuron by 15.90%. Moreover, potted maize experiment showed that the addition of the SynCom alleviated the toxic effects of herbicide mixtures on the plants. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive perspective for assessing the ecological risk at taxonomic and functional levels and the biodegradation approach of herbicide mixtures residue on agricultural soils in Northeastern China.

TI  - Quantification of Microorganisms Using a Functional Gene Approach
T2  - QUANTITATIVE REAL-TIME PCR IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) represents an effective method to quantify genes or transcripts within environmental samples. For that reason, qPCR has been widely used to characterize the functional patterns of complex microbial communities. In this chapter we summarize some recent applications of different qPCR approaches targeting functional genes encoding key enzymes in the N-, C- and S-cycles and also functional genes related to antibiotic resistance. We also point out some limitation of qPCR approaches. The ongoing development of new molecular techniques, like metagenomics, will have positive impacts on the specificity and the coverage of qPCR assays, since the availability of more sequence data will help to improve the design of primers targeting functional genes.

TI  - LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF FIRE ON NITROGEN CYCLING IN TALLGRASS PRAIRIE
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Fires in the tallgrass prairie are frequent and significantly alter nutrient cycling processes. We evaluated the short-term changes in plant production and microbial activity due to fire and the long-term consequences of annual burning on soil organic matter (SOM), plant production, and nutrient cycling using a combination of field, laboratory, and modeling studies. In the short-term, fire in the tallgrass prairie enhances microbial activity, increases both above- and belowground plant production, and increases nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). However, repeated annual burning results in greater inputs of lower quality plant residues causing a significant reduction in soil organic N, lower microbial biomass, lower N availability, and higher C:N ratios in SOM. Changes in amount and quality of belowground inputs increased N immobilization and resulted in no net increases in N availability with burning. This response occurred rapidly (e.g., within two years) and persisted during 50 years of annual burning. Plant production at a long-term burned site was not adversely affected due to shifts in plant NUE and carbon allocation. Modeling results indicate that the tallgrass ecosystem responds to the combined changes in plant resource allocation and NUE. No single factor dominates the impact of fire on tallgrass plant production.

TI  - Viral metagenomics reveals diverse virus-host interactions throughout the soil depth profile
T2  - MBIO
AB  - Soil microbes play pivotal roles in global carbon cycling; however, the fundamental interactions between microbes and their infecting viruses remain unclear. This is exacerbated with soil depth, where the patterns of viral dispersal, ecology, and evolution are markedly underexplored. To investigate viral communities throughout the soil depth profile, we leveraged a publicly available metagenomic data set sampled from grassland soil in Northern California. In total, 10,196 non-redundant viral operational taxonomic units were recovered from soil between 20 cm and 115 cm below the surface. Viral prevalence was high throughout the soil depth profile, with viruses infecting dominant soil hosts, including Actinomycetia. Contrary to leading hypotheses, lysogeny did not dominate in the soil viral communities. Viral diversity was assessed at both the population level (i.e., macrodiversity) and strain level (i.e., microdiversity) to reveal diverse ecological and evolutionary patterns of virus-host interactions in surface and subsurface soils. Investigating viral microdiversity uncovered potential patterns of antagonistic co-evolution across both surface and subsurface soils. Furthermore, we have provided evidence for the potential of soil viruses to augment the remineralization of soil carbon. While we continue to yield a more comprehensive understanding of soil viral ecology, our work appeals to future researchers to further investigate subsurface viral communities.IMPORTANCESoil viruses can moderate the roles that their host microbes play in global carbon cycling. However, given that most studies investigate the surface layer (i.e., top 20 cm) of soil, the extent to which this occurs in subsurface soil (i.e., below 20 cm) is unknown. Here, we leveraged public sequencing data to investigate the interactions between viruses and their hosts at soil depth intervals, down to 115 cm. While most viruses were detected throughout the soil depth profile, their adaptation to host microbes varied. Nonetheless, we uncovered evidence for the potential of soil viruses to encourage their hosts to recycle plant-derived carbon in both surface and subsurface soils. This work reasons that our understanding of soil viral functions requires us to continue to dig deeper and compare viruses existing throughout soil ecosystems.

TI  - Ice-on-snow and compacted and absent snowpack exert contrasting effects on soil carbon cycling in a northern boreal forest
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - In boreal forests, snow typically covers the forest floor and insulates soil from low and fluctuating air temperature for a large part of the year. Snowpack regimes are currently changing in response to climate warming, and it is uncertain how changing subnivean conditions (i.e. those under the snow cover) will impact soil processes. Here, we experimentally tested in a northern boreal forest how three various types of snow cover changes 1) ice encasement, 2) the absence of snow, and 3) snow compaction influence wintertime soil gas concentrations, growing season microbial respiration and biomass, extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen (N). The consequences varied drastically among experimental treatments. An initially strong increase in wintertime soil CO2 accumulation in response to ice encasement weakened during the course of the 3-year experiment, when at the same time, growing season phenol oxidase decreased by 13% and beta-glucosidase activity increased by 25%. The absence of snow enhanced beta-glucosidase activity by 47% and, by the third year of experiment, increased inorganic soil N concentration. Snow compaction, in turn, enhanced phenol oxidase activity by 27% together with soil microbial respiration and biomass carbon. These findings suggest that consequences of snowpack regime change on the boreal forest soil carbon and nutrient cycling may vary from positive to negative depending on the type of change in the snow cover that becomes dominant.

TI  - Root quality and decomposition environment, but not tree species richness, drive root decomposition in tropical forests
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aims Tropical forests contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle, yet the relative importance of tree diversity on key ecosystem processes such as root decomposition remains unknown.
   Methods We examined the influence of tree species richness on root decomposition over 485 days at two sites in Panama with contrasting soil fertility. Diversity effects on decomposition rates were calculated where 1) overstory tree species richness and composition matched that occurring inside root decomposition bags and 2) where roots of contrasting species richness decomposed under a common tree overstory. In addition, we tested 27 root traits to identify those that contribute to predict root decomposition in tropical forests.
   Results Tree species richness did not affect root decomposition rates, neither when species were manipulated within bags nor with varying tree overstory richness. Root carbon quality and micronutrient concentrations such as manganese explained 47 and 81 % of the variation in decomposition rates in the fertile and infertile site, respectively, demonstrating that the relative importance of traits was modulated by the soil environment.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that root decomposition in tropical forests is mediated by root functional composition and the soil environment rather than by species richness.

TI  - High impact of bacterial predation on cyanobacteria in soil biocrusts
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Diverse bacteria lead a life as pathogens or predators of other bacteria in many environments. However, their impact on emerging ecological processes in natural settings remains to be assessed. Here we describe a novel type of obligate, intracellular predatory bacterium of widespread distribution that preys on soil cyanobacteria in biocrusts. The predator, Candidatus Cyanoraptor togatus, causes localized, cm-sized epidemics that are visible to the naked eye, obliterates cyanobacterial net primary productivity, and severely impacts crucial biocrust properties like nitrogen cycling, dust trapping and moisture retention. The combined effects of high localized morbidity and areal incidence result in decreases approaching 10% of biocrust productivity at the ecosystem scale. Our findings show that bacterial predation can be an important loss factor shaping not only the structure but also the function of microbial communities.

TI  - Higher CH4 production in permafrost while oxidation prevails in the active layer: Insights from a forest-wetland ecotone in Northeast China
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
AB  - Continuous climate warming results in a deeper active layer and elevated CH4 emissions. However, our knowledge about the CH4 production and oxidation potentials in active layers and permafrost remains limited. This study explored the CH4 production and oxidation potentials in these layers and their responses to temperature variations across two habitats in the Da Xing'an Mountains in northeast China. The results showed that the CH4 production potential was higher in permafrost than in the active layer across forest and wetland habitats (p < 0.05). The temperature sensitivity was greater in the active layer (1.98 +/- 0.20 in forests, 3.42 +/- 0.37 in wetlands) than in permafrost (1.59 +/- 0.13 in forests, 2.08 +/- 0.34 in wetlands). CH4 oxidation potential was higher in the active layer than in permafrost (p < 0.05). However, its temperature sensitivity was higher in permafrost (3.65 +/- 0.76 in forests, 2.62 +/- 0.50 in wetlands) than in the active layer (3.46 +/- 0.66 in forests, 1.90 +/- 0.32 in wetlands). The key abiotic driving these processes were pH and soil water content. Amongst microbial properties, CH4 production was enhanced by the abundance of mcrA genes and methanogenic diversity rather than by community composition. On the contrary, CH4 oxidation was influenced by pmoA gene abundance, methanotrophic diversity and community composition. Soil parameters and microbial factors accounted for 78% of the variance in CH4 production and 60% in CH4 oxidation potential. Overall, this study highlights the different production and oxidation potentials of CH4 in the active layer and permafrost within a forest-wetland ecotone, as well as their controlling factors. These findings emphasise the importance of considering changes in the active layer when modelling greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost regions under a warming climate.

TI  - The effects of soil incorporation depth of Biodiesel Co-Product (BCP) additions on N leaching losses and on genes involved in soil nitrogen cycling in an acidic Chinese tea soil
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB  - The effectiveness of Biodiesel Co-Product (BCP) in decreasing N leaching from an acidic soil (pH 3.7) and effects on greenhouse gas emissions and N functional genes following surface application (0-6-cm depth) of 4.5 mg BCP-C g-1 soil and complete mixing (0-18-cm depth) of 1.5 mg BCP-C g(-1) soil, was investigated in a 35-day laboratory lysimeter experiment. The BCP additions significantly decreased AOA and AOB amoA gene copy numbers, especially from the surface BCP application, suggesting both methods therefore inhibited nitrification. Microbial biomass N and C significantly increased following both types of BCP incorporation, particularly with surface mixing, as compared to treatments without BCP. BCP increased nifH genes with both applications. Surface application of BCP produced higher emission rates of N2O and CO2 than complete mixing. Based upon (nirS+nirK)/nosZ ratios, more N2O emissions, caused by denitrification, came from the surface application than complete mixing, in support of the gaseous measurement of N2O. However, complete mixing was more effective than surface BCP application in decreasing N leaching: 2.14% of N-15 fertilizer in the leachate from complete mixing, compared to 51% following surface application, and 68% without BCP addition. These findings demonstrate that complete mixing was more effective than surface BCP application in decreasing N leaching and gaseous losses. We conclude that BCP is an effective and biologically safe method to prevent nitrate leaching in this acidic Chinese soil.

TI  - Continental-scale Impacts of Livestock Grazing on Ecosystem Supporting and Regulating Services
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Grazing by livestock supports millions of people worldwide, particularly in drylands, but has marked negative effects on ecosystem services and functions. In Australia, its effects on ecosystem services have not been fully quantified. We examined the extent to which grazing by livestock influenced supporting (productivity, habitat for organisms and biodiversity) and regulating (carbon cycling and hydrological function) services, using data from published and unpublished studies on livestock grazing from a large number of sites across Australia. Grazing reduced our measure of supporting services by about 20% and regulatory services by 8%. On average, grazing reduced plant productivity by 40%, habitat value by 20%, and biodiversity, hydrological function and carbon sequestration by about 10%. Habitat and productivity showed strong declines with increasing grazing intensity, and carbon showed strong declines at the lowest and highest contrasts. Hydrological function and biodiversity did not decline with increasing grazing intensity. Overall, the results indicate that livestock grazing leads to substantial degradation at a continental scale by reducing ecosystem services associated with habitat provision, biodiversity, and soil and water functions. Management of livestock grazing will be critical if we are to retain functional levels of ecosystem services into the next century. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Lower soil nitrogen-oxide emissions associated with enhanced denitrification under replacing mineral fertilizer with manure in orchard soils
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Emerging evidence suggests that replacing mineral fertilizers with organic livestock manure can effectively suppress reactive gaseous nitrogen (N) emissions from soils. However, the extent of this mitigation potential and the underlying microbial mechanisms in orchards remain unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we measured nitrous and nitric oxide (N2O and NO) emissions, microbial N cycling gene abundance, and N2O isotopomer ratios in pear and citrus orchards under three different fertilization regimes: no fertilization, mineral fertilizer, and manure plus mineral fertilizer. The results showed that although manure application caused large transient peaks of N2O, it reduced cumulative emissions of N2O and NO by an average of 20 % and 17 %, respectively, compared to the mineral fertilizer treatment. Partial replacement of mineral fertilizers with manure enhanced the contribution of AOA to nitrification and reduced the contribution of AOB, thus reducing N2O emissions from nitrification. Isotope analysis suggested that the pathway for N2O production in the soils of both orchards was dominated by bacterial denitrification and nitrifier denitrification. The manure treatment reduced the ratio of denitrification products. Additionally, the dual isotope mixing model results indicated that partially replacing mineral fertilizers with manure could promote soil denitrification, resulting in more N2O being reduced. N -oxide emissions were on average 67 % higher in the pear orchard than in the citrus orchard, probably due to the differences in soil physicochemical properties and growth habits between the two orchards. These findings underscore the potential of partially replacing mineral fertilizers with organic manure in orchards to reduce gaseous N emissions, contributing to the transition towards environmentally sustainable and climate -smart agricultural practices.

TI  - Reviewing the carbon cycle dynamics and carbon sequestration potential of Cyperus papyrus L. wetlands in tropical Africa
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Tropical papyrus wetlands have the ability to assimilate and sequester significant amounts of carbon. However, the spatial extent, productivity and carbon sink strength associated with papyrus wetlands remains poorly characterised. The objective of this study was to collate information from peer-reviewed publications and relevant government and NGO reports to better understand carbon dynamics within papyrus dominated wetlands, and to assess the processes that regulate the magnitude of the carbon sink. Papyrus wetlands were shown to exhibit high rates of photosynthetic carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation of up to 40 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) where the incident photosynthetic photon flux density was a parts per thousand yen1,000 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), high rates of net primary production ranging between 14 and 52 g DM m(-2) d(-1) and represent a significant carbon sink where up to 88 t C ha(-1) is stored in the aboveground and belowground components of the papyrus vegetation. Under flooded conditions significant detrital and peat deposits accumulate in excess of 1 m in depth, representing an additional carbon store in the order of 640 t C ha(-1). This study also highlighted the lack of empirical data on emissions of other radiatively important trace gases such as methane and nitrous oxide and also the vulnerability of these carbon sinks to both future changes in climate, in particular periods of hydrological drawdown, and anthropogenic land use change where the papyrus vegetation is removed in favour of subsistence agricultural cropping systems.

TI  - Drivers of soil microbial and detritivore activity across global grasslands
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
AB  - Covering approximately 40% of land surfaces, grasslands provide critical ecosystem services that rely on soil organisms. However, the global determinants of soil biodiversity and functioning remain underexplored. In this study, we investigate the drivers of soil microbial and detritivore activity in grasslands across a wide range of climatic conditions on five continents. We apply standardized treatments of nutrient addition and herbivore reduction, allowing us to disentangle the regional and local drivers of soil organism activity. We use structural equation modeling to assess the direct and indirect effects of local and regional drivers on soil biological activities. Microbial and detritivore activities are positively correlated across global grasslands. These correlations are shaped more by global climatic factors than by local treatments, with annual precipitation and soil water content explaining the majority of the variation. Nutrient addition tends to reduce microbial activity by enhancing plant growth, while herbivore reduction typically increases microbial and detritivore activity through increased soil moisture. Our findings emphasize soil moisture as a key driver of soil biological activity, highlighting the potential impacts of climate change, altered grazing pressure, and eutrophication on nutrient cycling and decomposition within grassland ecosystems.
   A global grassland study reveals soil moisture, not local treatments, drives microbial and detritivore activity, highlighting the potential influence of climate change and human interventions on grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Multiple distinct, scale-dependent links between fungi and decomposition
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Decomposition has historically been considered a function of climate and substrate but new research highlights the significant role of specific micro-organisms and their interactions. In particular, wood decay is better predicted by variation in fungal communities than in climate. Multiple links exist: interspecific competition slows decomposition in more diverse fungal communities, whereas trait variation between different communities also affects process rates. Here, we paired field and laboratory experiments using a dispersal gradient at a forest-shrubland ecotone to examine how fungi affect wood decomposition across scales. We observed that while fungal communities closer to forests were capable of faster decomposition, wood containing diverse fungal communities decomposed more slowly, independent of location. Dispersal-driven stochasticity in small-scale community assembly was nested within large-scale turnover in the regional species pool, decoupling the two patterns. We thus find multiple distinct links between microbes and ecosystem function that manifest across different spatial scales.

TI  - Impact of drainage on peatland soil environments and greenhouse gas emissions in Northeast China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Peatlands are vital for global carbon storage, but drainage significantly disrupts their natural carbon cycling. Drainage alters peatland soil environments in complex ways, affecting factors such as water table, soil temperature, organic carbon (SOC), pH, and microbial communities. However, how these factors interact to influence GHG emissions remains unclear. In this study, we compared water table, soil temperature, soil properties, microbial community structure, and GHG emissions across three zones of a peatland in Northeast China undergoing drainage: drained, transition, and natural areas. The average water table in the drained area was significantly lower than in the natural area (from 11.45 cm to -13.47 cm), shifting from waterlogged to unsaturated conditions. Deep soil temperatures in the drained area decreased by 1 similar to 3 degrees C. The pH of the upper soil layer was higher in the drained area (5.05 similar to 5.29 vs. 4.64 similar to 4.71), while SOC was lower (197.31 similar to 374.75 g/kg vs. 437.05 similar to 512.71 g/kg). Aerobic bacteria (mainly Solibacter) were more abundant in the drained area, while methanogens (mainly hydrogenotrophic) declined significantly. Fungal diversity increased from the natural to drained area with increased negative interactions and enhanced network modularity. Drainage reduced CH4 emissions but increased CO2 and N2O emissions, resulting in a significant rise in net GHG emissions (8.86 similar to 10.65 vs. 22.27 similar to 24.26 t CO2-eq.ha(-1).season(-1)), primarily driven by increased CO2. CO2 emissions were positively correlated with soil temperature, aerobic bacteria, facultatively anaerobic bacteria and pH, but negatively correlated with water table, anaerobic bacteria, soil moisture and C/N ratio. CH4 flux was positively correlated with methanogens and water table, but negatively correlated with pH. The effects of drainage were more pronounced near drainage ditches, particularly for CO2 emissions, highlighting the localized impacts of drainage on peatland GHG fluxes.

TI  - Winter Climate Change Reshapes Soil Climate and Biogeochemistry in a Novel Snowmelt Experiment
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Winter climate change is outpacing our conceptual understanding of how winter conditions regulate soil biogeochemical cycling and ultimately impact vital ecosystem services like soil carbon and nutrient retention. In seasonally snow-covered ecosystems like northern temperate forests, increasingly inconsistent winters lead to less precipitation falling as snow, frequent midwinter snow melting, and the loss of a stable, insulative snowpack. These changes leave soils vulnerable to freezing, freeze/thaw cycling, and increasing dry/wet cycles from added snowmelt and rainwater. To uncover how these new winter soil climate conditions alter soil biogeochemistry, we introduce the DeFR*ST (Determining Forest Responses to Snowmelt Treatments) experiment, a novel approach where we melt snow in situ throughout the winter and monitor changes to soil climate, gas exchange, and biogeochemical cycling. We installed DeFR*ST in a New England temperate forest, an ecosystem that is part of the most significant global carbon sink and is also in the epicenter of winter climate change in the US. Experimental snow melting drove soil moisture fluctuations in addition to deep and persistent soil freezing. In turn, soils in melted plots exhibited blocked gas diffusion and lower soil oxygen availability. Oxygen limitation may have driven shifts in soil processes from high redox potential metabolisms like aerobic decomposition and nutrient mineralization towards low redox potential metabolisms like iron reduction and the dissolution of iron and carbon from organo-mineral associations. As these changes snowball, altered soil properties and shifts in soil microbial community structure and function could reshape forest biogeochemical cycling, both in these forests and more broadly across seasonally snow-covered ecosystems.

TI  - Effect of clonal integration on nitrogen cycling in rhizosphere of rhizomatous clonal plant, Phyllostachys bissetii, under heterogeneous light
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Clonal integration plays an important role in clonal plant adapting to heterogeneous habitats. It was postulated that clonal integration could exhibit positive effects on nitrogen cycling in the rhizosphere of clonal plant subjected to heterogeneous light conditions. An in-situ experiment was conducted using clonal fragments of Phyllostachys bissetii with two successive ramets. Shading treatments were applied to offspring or mother ramets, respectively, whereas counterparts were treated to full sunlight. Rhizomes between two successive ramets were either severed or connected. Extracellular enzyme activities and nitrogen turnover were measured, as well as soil properties. Abundance of functional genes (archaeal or bacterial amoA, nifH) in the rhizosphere of shaded, offspring or mother ramets were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Carbon or nitrogen availabilities were significantly influenced by clonal integration in the rhizosphere of shaded ramets. Clonal integration significantly increased extracellular enzyme activities and abundance of functional genes in the rhizosphere of shaded ramets. When rhizomes were connected, higher nitrogen turnover (nitrogen mineralization or nitrification rates) was exhibited in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. However, nitrogen turnover was significantly decreased by clonal integration in the rhizosphere of shaded mother ramets. Path analysis indicated that nitrogen turnover in the rhizosphere of shaded, offspring or mother ramets were primarily driven by the response of soil microorganisms to dissolved organic carbon or nitrogen. This unique in-situ experiment provided insights into the mechanism of nutrient recycling mediated by clonal integration. It was suggested that effects of clonal integration on the rhizosphere microbial processes were dependent on direction of photosynthates transport in clonal plant subjected to heterogeneous light conditions.

TI  - A group of ectomycorrhizal fungi restricts organic matter accumulation in boreal forest
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Boreal forest soils are important global carbon sinks, with significant storage in the organic topsoil. Decomposition of these stocks requires oxidative enzymes, uniquely produced by fungi. Across Swedish boreal forests, we found that local carbon storage in the organic topsoil was 33% lower in the presence of a group of closely related species of ectomycorrhizal fungi - Cortinarius acutus s.l.. This observation challenges the prevailing view that ectomycorrhizal fungi generally act to increase carbon storage in soils but supports the idea that certain ectomycorrhizal fungi can complement free-living decomposers, maintaining organic matter turnover, nutrient cycling and tree productivity under nutrient-poor conditions. The indication that a narrow group of fungi may exert a major influence on carbon cycling questions the prevailing dogma of functional redundancy among microbial decomposers. Cortinarius acutus s.l. responds negatively to stand-replacing disturbance, and associated population declines are likely to increase soil carbon sequestration while impeding long-term nutrient cycling.

TI  - Mammoths at the margins: new δ13C and δ15N isotope data from the southeast of the Western Siberian plain
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB  - This study investigates the carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) remains from three Late Pleistocene paleontological sites in the southeast of the Western Siberian Plain (SEWS): Shestakovo, Krasnoyarskaya Kurya, and Volchia Griva. This region and time interval (28-22 ka cal BP) remain underrepresented in isotopic records, particularly for 613C and 615N values. We analysed 29 mammoth dentine samples, alongside dentine from one horse and one deer. Preservation quality was rigorously evaluated using established criteria, including C:N atomic ratios, collagen yields, and elemental carbon and nitrogen content. Our results reveal the densest concentration of the highest mammoth 615N values reported for the Northern Hemisphere. We attribute this isotopic enrichment to the unique local environmental conditions at Volchia Griva, including saline soils and intensive trampling, which may have altered nitrogen cycling at the site.

TI  - Effect of drought stress on symbiotic nitrogen fixation, soil nitrogen availability and soil microbial diversity in forage legumes
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsForage legumes form mutualistic interactions with specialized soil rhizobia bacteria that inhabit root nodules and fix atmospheric nitrogen. However, legumes are sensitive to drought stress, which can interrupt nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF). We hypothesize that drought-impaired SNF may influence soil nitrogen availability and soil microbial diversity.MethodsHere, we evaluated the effects of drought on nodulation, plant growth, physiological parameters, SNF, soil nitrogen availability, soil extracellular enzyme activity, and soil microbiome of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and red clover (Trifolium pratense). The drought treatments were imposed at the flowering stage by maintaining soil moisture contents at 20% field capacity (FC) (severe drought), 40% FC (moderate drought), and 80% FC (well-watered) for three weeks.ResultsDrought significantly reduced nodulation, root and shoot growth, and SNF in alfalfa and red clover. Soil available nitrogen was significantly increased following severe drought conditions. The enzyme assays showed reduced activity of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and beta-D cellobiosidase enzymes under drought stress in alfalfa and red clover, respectively. Microbiome data showed shifts in the relative abundance of some key bacterial taxa under drought stress.ConclusionOverall results indicate that drought has deleterious effects on SNF and plant growth, affecting carbon and nitrogen cycling enzymes, soil nitrogen availability, and soil microbial diversity.

TI  - Altered soil microbial community at elevated CO2 leads to loss of soil carbon
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Increased carbon storage in ecosystems due to elevated CO2 may help stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations and slow global warming. Many field studies have found that elevated CO2 leads to higher carbon assimilation by plants, and others suggest that this can lead to higher carbon storage in soils, the largest and most stable terrestrial carbon pool. Here we show that 6 years of experimental CO2 doubling reduced soil carbon in a scrub-oak ecosystem despite higher plant growth, offsetting approximate to 52% of the additional carbon that had accumulated at elevated CO2 in aboveground and coarse root biomass. The decline in soil carbon was driven by changes in soil microbial composition and activity. Soils exposed to elevated CO2 had higher relative abundances of fungi and higher activities of a soil carbon-degrading enzyme, which led to more rapid rates of soil organic matter degradation than soils exposed to ambient CO2. The isotopic composition of microbial fatty acids confirmed that elevated CO2 increased microbial utilization of soil organic matter. These results show how elevated CO2, by altering soil microbial communities, can cause a potential carbon sink to become a carbon source.

TI  - Short-term nitrogen addition improves soil phosphorus availability by regulating phosphorus-cycling microbial communities in a karst forest
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - The widening imbalance between escalating nitrogen (N) deposition and depleting soil phosphorus (P) amplifies the urgency of investigating P cycling processes in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the mechanisms by which Pcycling functional profiles drive soil P mobilization under enhanced N deposition remain to be addressed. After a three-year N-addition experiment at varying rates in a karst forest, we determined the soil P fractions and associated bacterial communities involved in regulating P cycling in rhizosphere and bulk soils. Our results showed that N addition increased plant-available P in both bulk soil (+17 % under low N, +22 % under high N) and rhizosphere soil (+6%, +23 %), while concurrently reducing organic P in bulk soil (-18 %, -24 %) and rhizosphere soil (-8%, -23 %) under corresponding N rates. In addition, N treatment substantially shifted the composition of the P-cycling bacterial community and increased the richness of the community, indicating that N input enhances P availability, potentially through the regulation of the bacterial communities involved in P cycling. Moreover, we found that the functional bacterial genes responsible for P transformation differed between the bulk and rhizosphere soils. Specifically, in the bulk soil, P mineralization genes and P solubilization genes were significantly increased by N treatment. In contrast, in the rhizosphere soil, P mineralization and P regulation genes increased in response to N addition. Together, these results suggest that N addition improves soil P availability by regulating P-cycling functional bacterial communities; however, the specific functional profiles driving P mobilization may differ between bulk and rhizosphere soils. These findings provide novel insight into the regulatory processes of soil P cycling in terrestrial ecosystems under global changes (e.g., N deposition) from a microbial gene perspective.

TI  - Soil-nitrogen cycling in a pine forest exposed to 5 years of elevated carbon dioxide
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Empirical and modeling studies have shown that the magnitude and duration of the primary production response to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) can be constrained by limiting supplies of soil nitrogen (N). We have studied the response of a southern US pine forest to elevated CO2 for 5 years (1997-2001). Net primary production has increased significantly under elevated CO2. We hypothesized that the increase in carbon (C) fluxes to the microbial community under elevated CO2 would increase the rate of N immobilization over mineralization. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the pool sizes and fluxes of inorganic and organic N in the forest floor and top 30 cm of mineral soil during the first 5 years Of CO2 fumigation. We observed no statistically significant change in the gross or net rate of inorganic N mineralization and immobilization in any soil horizon under elevated CO2, Similarly, elevated CO2 had no statistically significant effect on the concentration or flux of organic N, including amino acids. Microbial biomass N was not significantly different between CO2 treatments. Thus, we reject our hypothesis that elevated CO2 increases the rate of N immobilization. The quantity and chemistry of the litter inputs to the forest floor and mineral soil horizons can explain the limited range of microbially mediated soil-N cycling responses observed in this ecosystem. Nevertheless a comparative analysis of ecosystem development at this site and other loblolly pine forests suggests that rapid stand development and C sequestration under elevated CO2 may be possible only in the early stages of stand development, prior to the onset of acute N limitation.

TI  - Non-mycorrhizal uptake of amino acids by roots of the alpine sedge Kobresia myosuroides: Implications for the alpine nitrogen cycle
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Non-mycorrhizal plants of the alpine sedge, Kobresia myosuroides, take up the amino acid glycine from nutrient solutions at greater rates than NO3- or NH4+. The amino acids glutamate and proline were also taken up at high rates. Total plant biomass was twice as high after 4 months of growth on glycine, compared to NH4NO3, with significant increases in both root and leaf biomass. By taking advantage of differences in the delta(13)C signature of air in the growth chamber and the glycine used for growth , a two-member mixing model was used to estimate that a significant amount of the glycine was taken up as intact molecules, enough to contribute 16% of the total carbon assimilation over a 4-month growing period. Glycine uptake was inhibited when roots were exposed to N-2 in place of air, and when the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was added to the rood solution. From these results it is concluded that glycine uptake occurs through active transport. Glycine uptake exhibited a Q(10) of 2.0 over the temperature range 5-15 degrees C C, with relatively high rates maintained at the lowest temperature measured (5 degrees C). Roots of Kobresia were not capable of taking up NH4+ at measureable rates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a plant whose non-mycorrhizal roots cannot take up NH4+. Measurements of three N fractions (No-3(-), NH4+, and total amino acids) in the soil pore water were made over total amino acids) in the soil pore water were made over two growing seasons in two Kobresia dry meadows using microlysimeters. At the West Knoll site, which is characterized by soils with average amounts of organic matter, the dominant forms of N in the soil pore water were NO3 and NH4+ (0-450 mu mol L. amino acid concentrations were generally less than 20 mu mol L(-1) at his site. At the East Knoll site, which is characterized by soils with higher than average amounts of organic matter, amino acids were generally present at higher concentrations (17-100 mu mol L(-1)), compared to No-3(-) and NH4+. The most abundant amino acids were glycine (10-100 mu mol L(-1)), glutamate (5-70 mu mol L(-1)), and late in the season cysteine (5-15 mu mol L(-1)). The results demonstrate that this sedge, which dominates dry meadow communities in many alpine ecosystems, is capable of taking up intact amino acids as a principal N source, and has access to high amino acid concentrations in certain alpine soils. Such uptake of organic N may accommodate plant N demands in the face of slow alpine N mineralization rates due to cold soil temperatures.

TI  - Effect of Calcium Addition on Extracellular Enzymes and Soil Organic Carbon in Maize Rhizosphere Soils
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - This study examined the regulatory mechanism of calcium (Ca) amendment on the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) fractions and extracellular enzyme activities, elucidating the role of Ca in soil carbon cycling processes. A field experiment with maize was conducted, comparing treatments of low calcium (T1), high calcium (T2), and a calcium-free control (CK). Measurements included inter-root SOC fractions-soluble organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and readily oxidizable organic carbon (ROC)-and the activities of the following extracellular enzymes: beta-xylanase, beta-glucosidase (beta-glu), phenol oxidase (Phox), peroxidase (Pero), phosphatase (Phos), acetylaminoglucosidase (NAG), and urease. The main findings indicated the following: (1) Calcium addition significantly increased SOC content (115.04% and 99.22% higher in T1 and T2, respectively, than CK during the entire reproductive period) and enhanced microbial activity (elevated DOC and MBC). However, SOC decreased by 8.44% (T1) and 16.38% (T2) relative to CK in the late reproductive stage (irrigation-ripening), potentially reflecting microbial utilization (supported by the inverse correlation between SOC and MBC/DOC), and maize carbon reallocation during grain filling. (2) Calcium activated beta-glu, Phox, Phos, NAG, and urease (p < 0.05), with pronounced increases in Phox (241.13 IU<middle dot>L-1) and Phos (1126.65 U<middle dot>L-1), indicating enhanced organic matter mineralization and phosphorus availability. (3) Calcium-driven MBC and ROC accumulation was associated with the positive regulation of Phox (path coefficient > 0.8) and the negative regulation of Phos. SOC was co-regulated by beta-glu and Phos (R-2 = 0.753). (4) Calcium dynamically optimized the short-term carbon distribution through enzyme activity while promoting long-term sequestration. Our study provides new evidence supporting multi-pathway interactions through which calcium mediates enzyme networks to influence the soil carbon cycle. The findings provide a theoretical foundation for calcium fertilizer management and soil carbon sequestration strategies in agriculture, advancing academic and practical goals for sustainable development and carbon neutrality.

TI  - The role of chitin in the decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungal litter
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Ectomycorrhizal fungal tissues comprise a significant forest-litter pool. Ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi may also influence the decomposition of other forest-litter components via competitive interactions with decomposer fungi and by ensheathing fine roots. Because of these direct and indirect effects of ectomycorrhizal fungi, the factors that control the decomposition of EM fungi will strongly control forest-litter decomposition as a whole and, thus, ecosystem nutrient and carbon cycling. Some have suggested that chitin, a component of fungal cell walls, reduces fungal tissue decomposition because it is relatively recalcitrant. We therefore examined the change in chitin concentrations of EM fungal tissues during decomposition. Our results show that chitin is not recalcitrant relative to other compounds in fungal tissues and that its concentration is positively related to the decomposition of fungal tissues. Variation existing among EM fungal isolates in chitin concentration suggests that EM fungal community structure influences C and nutrient cycling.

TI  - Effects of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) invasions on soil nitrogen cycles depend on invasion stage and warming
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Plant invasions may alter soil nutrient cycling due to differences in physiological traits between the invader and species they displace as well as differences in responses to anthropogenic factors such as nitrogen deposition and warming. Moso bamboo is expanding its range rapidly around the world, displacing diverse forests. In addition, near expansion fronts where invasions are patchy, moso bamboo and other species each contribute soil inputs. Nitrogen transformations and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are important processes associated with nutrient availability and climate change that may be impacted by bamboo invasions. We collected soils from uninvaded, mixed, and bamboo forests to understand bamboo invasion effects on carbon and N cycling. We incubated soils with warming and N addition and measured net nitrification and N mineralization rates and GHG (CO2 and N2O) emissions. Mixed forest soils had higher pH and total N and lower total organic carbon and C/N than either uninvaded or bamboo forest soils. Bamboo forest soils had higher total carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and ammonium N but lower total and nitrate N than uninvaded forest soils. Soil GHG emissions did not vary among forest types at lower temperatures but bamboo forest soils had higher CO2 and lower N2O emissions at higher temperatures. While net N transformation rates were lower in bamboo and uninvaded forest soils, they were highest in mixed forest soils, indicating non-additive effects of bamboo invasions. This suggests that plant invasion effects on N transformations and GHG emissions with global change in forests partially invaded by bamboo are difficult to predict from only comparing uninvaded and bamboo-dominated areas.

TI  - Widespread foliage δ15N depletion under elevated CO2: inferences for the nitrogen cycle
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Leaf N-15 signature is a powerful tool that can provide an integrated assessment of the nitrogen (N) cycle and whether it is influenced by rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. We tested the hypothesis that elevated CO2 significantly changes foliage delta(15)N in a wide range of plant species and ecosystem types. This objective was achieved by determining the delta(15)N of foliage of 27 field-grown plant species from six free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments representing desert, temperate forest, Mediterranean-type, grassland prairie, and agricultural ecosystems. We found that within species, the delta(15)N of foliage produced under elevated CO2 was significantly lower (P<0.038) compared with that of foliage grown under ambient conditions. Further analysis of foliage delta(15)N by life form and growth habit revealed that the CO2 effect was consistent across all functional groups tested. The examination of two chaparral shrubs grown for 6 years under a wide range of CO2 concentrations (25-75 Pa) also showed a significant and negative correlation between growth CO2 and leaf delta(15)N. In a select number of species, we measured bulk soil delta(15)N at a depth of 10 cm, and found that the observed depletion of foliage delta(15)N in response to elevated CO2 was unrelated to changes in the soil delta(15)N. While the data suggest a strong influence of elevated CO2 on the N cycle in diverse ecosystems, the exact site(s) at which elevated CO2 alters fractionating processes of the N cycle remains unclear. We cannot rule out the fact that the pattern of foliage delta(15)N responses to elevated CO2 reported here resulted from a general drop in delta(15)N of the source N, caused by soil-driven processes. There is a stronger possibility, however, that the general depletion of foliage delta(15)N under high CO2 may have resulted from changes in the fractionating processes within the plant/mycorrhizal system.

TI  - Insight into the mechanisms of plant growth promoting strain ZY2 in improving phytoremediation efficiency in perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)-contaminated soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is an anthropogenic perfluorinated alkyl substance which can enter the food chain and pose health risks. The hydrophilic carboxyl head of PFOA enhances its solubility in water, making it easier for PFOA to migrate with soil water and be absorbed by plants from the soil. Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPR) have the ability to compensate for plant growth disadvantage under unfavorable conditions and are therefore likely to reduce the negative effects of PFOA phytotoxicity on plant growth. However, the effectiveness of the PGPR-assisted plant systems for remediation of PFOA-contaminated soil has not yet been demonstrated. To this end, a novel strain of Rhizobium sp. was isolated and named as ZY2, which is tolerant to PFOA and exhibits significant plant growth -promoting trains. The results indicated that inoculation with strain ZY2 significantly increased the biomass of oilseed rape. Notably, the accumulation content of PFOA in oilseed rape roots increased significantly by 89.0 % and the removal of PFOA from the soil increased over 3 times after inoculation with ZY2. In addition, inoculated ZY2 also altered the rhizosphere soil bacterial community structure which might correlate with the production of a series of hydrolases and reductases involved in soil carbon and nitrogen cycling processes. Generally, this study offered a novel approach for establishing an effective phytoremediation system in PFOA-contaminated soil.

TI  - Effects of litter decomposition on sedimentary organic carbon sequestration in invasive and native halophyte marshes of Ganghwa, Korea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
AB  - Litter decomposition is a critical driver of carbon cycling in tidal flats, yet the extent to which decomposed organic carbon is sequestered in sediments remains unclear. We studied the effects of invasive Spartina alterniflora and native Phragmites australis litter decomposition on sedimentary organic carbon sequestration. Litterbag experiments were conducted over 360 days in tidal flats. Decomposition patterns were classified as rapid, moderate, and slow. Over 60 % of the litter carbon decomposed within the first 60 days in salt marsh (vegetated). In the bare tidal flat (unvegetated), S. alterniflora litter decomposed faster than P. australis litter. Bacterial composition shifted over time, being dominated sequentially by Bacteroidales, Bacillales, and then Pseudomonadales. Habitats with low Bacteroidales abundances showed lower initial decomposition rates. The decomposed carbon showed limited mobility and remained near the litter. These findings provide insights into the effects of litter decomposition on sedimentary organic carbon and its dynamics within sediments.

TI  - Soil microbial carbon and nitrogen limitation constraints soil organic carbon stability in arid and semi-arid grasslands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Microorganisms play dual roles in soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition and accumulation. Despite advancing insights into their involvement in the carbon cycle, understanding the impact of microbial community structure and physiological traits on SOC stabilization in arid and semi-arid grasslands remains elusive. Here, we analyzed arid and semi-arid grasslands SOC stability by comparing the ratio of mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) to particulate organic carbon (POC) across a grassland transect in north-south Ningxia, encompassing various grassland types and a broad climatic gradient (Delta MAP = 450 mm). By combining phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, enzyme activity vector models and stoichiometric theory, the influence of soil microbial community compositions, metabolic constraints, and carbon use efficiency (CUE) on SOC stability were explored. Results showed that SOC stability was the lowest in desert areas and decreased with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) in other grasslands. Microbial physiological traits, including microbial carbon (C) limitation, nitrogen (N) limitation, CUE, and lignocellulose index (LCI) varied among grasslands, with significantly higher LCI and CUE and lower C and N limitation in steppe desert. The variation of microbial physiological characteristics accounted for 53.28% of the variation in SOC stability. Distinct microbial metabolic limitations were evident in these grasslands, with N and C limitation prevailing and exerting strong negative impacts on CUE. Decreased fungal/bacterial (F/B) ratios also reduced microbial CUE and indirectly diminished SOC stability. In addition, clay content emerges as a major factor influencing the stabilization of SOC across environmental gradients. Collectively, our work suggests that mitigating microbial C and N limitation and enhancing microbial CUE under the influence of MAP and clay content are the key mechanisms governing SOC stabilization in regional grasslands. These findings bear significant implications for understanding microbial-mediated carbon cycling processes in arid and semi-arid grasslands.

TI  - Diversity of the Hydroxylamine Oxidoreductase (HAO) Gene and Its Enzyme Active Site in Agricultural Field Soils
T2  - MICROBES AND ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Nitrification is a key process in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle and a major emission source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). The periplasmic enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) is involved in the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitric oxide in the second step of nitrification, producing N2O as a byproduct. Its three-dimensional structure demonstrates that slight differences in HAO active site residues have inhibitor effects. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of the diversity of HAO active site residues in soil microorganisms is important for the development of novel nitrification inhibitors using structure-guided drug design. However, this has not yet been examined. In the present study, we investigated hao gene diversity in beta-proteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (beta-AOB) and complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox; Nitrospira spp.) bacteria in agricultural fields using a clone library analysis. A total of 1,949 hao gene sequences revealed that hao gene diversity in beta-AOB and comammox bacteria was affected by the fertilizer treatment and field type, respectively. Moreover, hao sequences showed the almost complete conservation of the six HAO active site residues in both beta-AOB and comammox bacteria. The diversity of nitrifying bacteria showed similarity between hao and amoA genes. The nxrB amplicon sequence revealed the dominance of Nitrospira cluster II in tea field soils. The present study is the first to reveal hao gene diversity in agricultural soils, which will accelerate the efficient screening of HAO inhibitors and evaluations of their suppressive effects on nitrification in agricultural soils.

TI  - Regulation of winter soil mineral nitrogen and N2O emissions by cover crop termination timing
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Cover crops (CCs) are widely promoted for reducing nitrate leaching and enhancing soil fertility, yet their role in regulating winter nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions remains poorly understood. This field study assessed how termination timing of oil radish (Raphanus sativus) influenced soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) dynamics and winter N2O emissions across five site-years in a humid temperate climate (Germany) on contrasting soil textures (loamy and sandy). Treatments included autumn termination, spring termination, and fallow. Although CCs reduced SMN by similar to 65% compared to fallow by December, this did not lead to lower winter N2O emissions. Instead, cumulative emissions over a standardized 100-day winter period were highest under autumn termination (1.23 +/- 0.11 kg N2O-N ha(-1)), followed by spring termination (0.65 +/- 0.06 kg N2O-N ha(-1)) and fallow (0.12 +/- 0.01 kg N2O-N ha(-1)). Emissions were higher in 2019 than 2020, associated with warmer and wetter conditions. Autumn termination also increased spring SMN levels relative to spring termination in loamy soils, but not in sandy soils, where nitrate leaching may have occurred. While microbial gene abundances indicated greater nitrification and denitrification potential under autumn termination, they did not correlate with actual N2O fluxes. These findings suggest that autumn termination can enhance winter emissions, whereas delayed termination may shift emissions to spring, particularly under fertilized conditions. Site-specific CC management that considers termination timing, soil texture, and climatic context is essential to balance nitrogen retention with N2O mitigation.

TI  - No home-field advantage in upper Andean tropical forests despite strong differences in site environmental characteristics
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
AB  - Litter decomposition is not fully explained by the general triangle of climate, litter quality and soil decomposers. Therefore, other theoretical frameworks, such as Home-Field Advantage (HFA), have emerged to explain the remaining variation of decomposition. HFA states that litter decomposes faster in their site of origin (home) than far from it (away). However, there are no consistent patterns of HFA and this can varies depending the ecosystem and plant species analyzed. One of the most variable ecosystems in terms of species biodiversity turnover, topography, and soil conditions are the Upper Andean Tropical Forests (UATF), but to date there is no study testing HFA in this ecosystem. Here, HFA was tested through a reciprocal litterbag translocation field experiment across different UATF. The experiment comprised 2520 litterbags placed in 14 20 x 20 m plots that belonged to four sites to analyze decomposition of 15 plant species for 18 months. Of these 15 species, seven were present at only one site. The mean decomposition was calculated for all 15 species to determine the relative decomposition at each site and the decomposition of the seven species at home and away sites was analyzed through two-way ANOVA (sites x species) and linear mixed models. I contrasted environmental charcteristics between sites including litter depth, slope, leaf area index, canopy openness, and microclimatic variables. The results showed that the pattern of decomposition was always the same, no matter the origin of the species and the decomposition period. Microclimate, litter depth, and slope varied between sites, yet these differences were not enough to influence affinity effects of decomposition, as relative decay rates were similar between home and away sites. Overall, no HFA was found in UATF possibly because: (i) strong environmental filters along montane forests homogenize decomposer communities; (ii) high diversity in litters drive decomposers with high ability to degrade different organic compounds; (iii) little adaptation of decomposers to recurrent litter as they respond mainly to changes in litter quality. These results imply that changes in species composition by current anthropogenic pressures could have profound impacts on carbon cycle and nutrient fluxes depending on the identity of species arriving in UATF.

TI  - Permafrost and land cover as controlling factors for light fraction organic matter on the southern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Permafrost degradation can stimulate the decomposition of organic soil matter and cause a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The light fraction organic matter (LFOM) is a labile substrate for microbial decomposition and probably plays an important role in future permafrost carbon cycles. However, little is known about the distribution of LFOM and its relationship with permafrost and environmental factors. Here, we investigated the light fraction carbon (LFC) and nitrogen (LFN) contents and stocks under meadows and wet meadows with different permafrost conditions on the southern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Our results showed that LFC and LFN were mainly distributed in the upper 30 cm of soils, and the sites with permafrost had significantly higher contents of LFC and LFN than those from the sites without existing permafrost. The LFC and LFN decreased sharplywith depth, suggesting that the soil organicmatter (SOM) in this areawas highly decomposed in deep soils. Soil moisture and bulk density explained approximately 50% of the variances in LFC and LFN for all the sampling sites, while soil moisture explained approximately 30% of the variance in permafrost sites. Both the C:N ratios and LFC: LFN ratios in the sites with permafrost were higher than those in the sites without permafrost. The results suggested that the permafrost and land cover types are the main factors controlling LFOM content and stock, and that permafrost degradation would lead to a decrease of LFOM and soil C: N ratios, thus accelerating the decomposition of SOM.

TI  - Carbon input to soil may decrease soil carbon content
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - It is commonly predicted that the intensity of primary production and soil carbon (C) content are positively linked. Paradoxically, many long-term field observations show that although plant litter is incorporated to soil in large quantities, soil C content does not necessarily increase. These results suggest that a negative relationship between C input and soil C conservation exists. Here, we demonstrate in controlled conditions that the supply of fresh C may accelerate the decomposition of soil C and induce a negative C balance. We show that soil C losses increase when soil microbes are nutrient limited. Results highlight the need for a better understanding of microbial mechanisms involved in the complex relationship between C input and soil C sequestration. We conclude that energy available to soil microbes and microbial competition are important determinants of soil C decomposition.

TI  - Influence of biowaste compost amendment on soil organic carbon storage under arid climate
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
AB  - Organic matter amendments have been proposed as a means to enhance soil carbon stocks on degraded soils, particularly under arid climate. Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a critical role in terrestrial carbon cycling and is central to preserving soil quality. The effects of biowaste compost (BWC) on soil carbon storage were investigated. In addition, changes in soil organic matter (SOM) and even soil organic carbon (SOC) in BWC-amended soils following different applications were studied. The added BWC quantities were as followed: BWC/soil (weight/weight (w/w) respectively: 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2). The different BWC-amended soils were assessed during 180days under arid ambient conditions and in comparison with control soil. Results showed a significant increase in SOM and SOC with relation to BWC quantities applied. This increase was relatively clear up to 120days, after which decrease in SOM and SOC levels were observed. Furthermore, results showed improved microbiological activities of the amended soils in comparison with the control soil. This was reflected by the increase of the amended soils' respirometric activities as cumulative carbon dioxide carbon (C-CO2) as function of incubation time and also in terms of specific respiration expressed as C-CO2/SOC ratios.Implications: Mediterranean soils under arid climate such as Tunisian soils are poor in organic matter content. Biowastes are potential source for soil fertilization. Composting process is the best method for the stabilization of organic matter of diverse origins. The biowaste compost amendment improves the soil organic carbon storage and enhances the soil microbial activity.

TI  - Nitrite stimulates HONO and NOx but not N2O emissions in Chinese agricultural soils during nitrification
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) and short-lived reactive nitrogen (Nr) gases such as ammonia (NH3), nitrous acid (HONO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are produced and emitted from fertilized soils and play a critical role for climate warming and air quality. However, only few studies have quantified the production and emission potentials for long-and short-lived gaseous nitrogen (N) species simultaneously in agricultural soils. To link the gaseous N species to intermediate N compounds [ammonium (NH4+), hydroxylamine (NH2OH), and nitrite (NO2  )] and estimate their temperature change potential, ex-situ dry-out experiments were conducted with three Chinese agricultural soils. We found that HONO and NOx (NO + NO2) emissions mainly depend on NO2 , while NH3 and N2O emissions are stimulated by NH4+ and NH2OH, respectively. Addition of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) and acetylene significantly reduced HONO and NOx emissions, while NH3 emissions were significantly enhanced in an alkaline Fluvo-aquic soil. These results suggested that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and complete ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (comammox Nitrospira) dominate HONO and NOx emissions in the alkaline Fluvo-aquic soil, while ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are dominant in the acidic Mollisol. DMPP effectively mitigated the warming effect in the Fluvo-aquic soil and the Ultisol. In conclusion, our findings highlight NO2  significantly stimulates HONO and NOx emissions from dryland agricultural soils, dominated by nitrification. In addition, subtle differences of soil NH3, N2O, HONO, and NOx emissions indicated different N turnover processes, and should be considered in biogeochemical and atmospheric chemistry models.

TI  - Impacts of land-use change on soil microbial communities and their function in the Amazon Rainforest
T2  - ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL. 175
AB  - The Amazon Rainforest is a global diversity hotspot that has experienced a significant level of deforestation over the past half century, primarily for the establishment of cattle pasture. Characterizing the impact of this large-scale ecosystem conversion on the composition and activity of the soil microbial community is crucial for understanding potentially consequential shifts in nutrient and greenhouse gas cycling, as well as adding to the body of knowledge concerning how tropical ecosystems respond to human disturbance. Research to date has shown that locally, communities of soil microorganisms tend to become more diverse upon conversion of forest to pasture. However, these communities undergo taxonomic homogenization at landscape-level spatial scales, mirroring the homogenization of plant communities across pastures. Microbial community structure is distinct between forest and pasture soil communities across several studies, and specific taxa, such as Firmicutes and Acidobacteria, show consistent association with pasture and forest soils, respectively. In addition, shifts in microbial community functions with pasture conversion have relevant impacts on both carbon and nitrogen cycling at the ecosystem scale: the abundance and diversity of methane-cycling prokaryotes shifts in conjunction with increased methane flux in pastures. Further, quantitation and community profiling of free-living nitrogen fixers has demonstrated that this functional group is favored in pastures and suggests that asymbiotic N-2 fixation may be a significantly augmented process. While human-driven deforestation is continuing, a large percentage of once-converted pastures are undergoing the process of secondary forest succession. Assessment of microbial communities in secondary forests compared to primary forests and pastures suggests convergence toward a recovery of functionality and community composition with reforestation.

TI  - Nitrogen-cycling microbial communities respond differently to nitrogen addition under two contrasting grassland soil types
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction The impact of nitrogen (N) deposition on the soil N-transforming process in grasslands necessitates further investigation into how N input influences the structural composition and diversity of soil N-cycling microbial communities across different grassland types.Methods In this study, we selected two types of grassland soils in northwest Liaoning, temperate steppe and warm-temperate shrub, and conducted short-term N addition experiments using organic N, ammonium N, and nitrate N as sources with three concentration gradients to simulate N deposition. Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology was employed to sequence genes associated with N-cycling microbes including N-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria, and ammonia-oxidizing archaea.Results and discussion The results revealed significant alterations in the structural composition and diversity of the N-cycling microbial community due to N addition, but the response of soil microorganisms varied inconsistent among different grassland types. Ammonium transformation rates had a greater impact on soils from temperate steppes while nitrification rates were more influential for soils from warm-temperate shrubs. Furthermore, the influence of the type of N source on soil N-cycling microorganisms outweighed that of its quantity applied. The ammonium type of nitrogen source is considered the most influential driving factor affecting changes in the structure of the microbial community involved in nitrogen transformation, while the amount of low nitrogen applied primarily determines the composition of soil bacterial communities engaged in nitrogen fixation and nitrification. Different groups of N-cycling microorganisms exhibited distinct responses to varying levels of nitrogen addition with a positive correlation observed between their composition, diversity, and environmental factors examined. Overall findings suggest that short-term nitrogen deposition may sustain dominant processes such as soil-N fixation within grasslands over an extended period without causing significant negative effects on northwestern Liaoning's grassland ecosystems within the next decade.

TI  - Pulse Effect of Precipitation: Spatial Patterns and Mechanisms of Soil Carbon Emissions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - The rapid and strong release of CO2 caused by precipitation (known as the pulse effect) is a common phenomenon that significantly affects ecosystem C cycling. However, the degree to which the pulse effect occurs overlarge regional scales remains unclear. In this study, we conducted continuous and high-frequency measurements of soil CO2 release rates (R-s) for 48 h after simulated precipitation, along a precipitation gradient of different grassland types (i.e., meadow, typical, and desert) in Inner Mongolia, China. Pulse effects were assessed using the maximum R-s (Rsoil-max) and accumulated CO2 emissions (A(Rs-soil)). Strong precipitation pulse effects were found in all sites; however, the effects differed among grassland types. In addition, an apparent decrease in both Rsoil-max and A(Rs-soil) was observed from the east to west, i.e., along the decreasing precipitation gradient. A(Rs-soil) values followed the order: temperate meadow grassland (0.097 mg C g(-1) soil) > typical temperate grassland (0.081 mg C g(-1) soil) > temperate desert grassland (0.040 mg C g(-1) soil). Furthermore, Rsoil-max and A(Rs-soil) were significantly positively correlated with soil quality (SOC, POC, and N, etc.; P < 0.01). A(Rs-soil) (P < 0.05) and A(Rs-SOC) (P < 0.01) were significantly affected. A(Rs-soil) and A(Rs-SOC) were also positively correlated with soil microbial biomass significantly (P < 0.05). Rsoil-max and A(Rs-soil) had similar spatial variations and controlling mechanisms. These results greatly support the substrate supply hypothesis for the effects of precipitation pulses, and provide valuable information for predicting CO2 emissions. Our findings also verified the significant effect of soil CO2 release from precipitation pulses on the grasslands of arid and semi-arid regions. Our data provide a scientific basis for model simulations to better predict the responses of ecosystem carbon cycles in arid and semi-arid regions under predicted climate change scenarios.

TI  - Increased soil moisture content increases plant N uptake and the abundance of 15N in plant biomass
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - The natural abundance of N-15 in plant biomass has been used to infer how N dynamics change with elevated atmospheric CO2 and changing water availability. However, it remains unclear if atmospheric CO2 effects on plant biomass N-15 are driven by CO2-induced changes in soil moisture. We tested whether N-15 abundance (expressed as delta N-15) in plant biomass would increase with increasing soil moisture content at two atmospheric CO2 levels. In a greenhouse experiment we grew sunflower (Helianthus annuus) at ambient and elevated CO2 (760 ppm) with three soil moisture levels maintained at 45, 65, and 85% of field capacity, thereby eliminating potential CO2-induced soil moisture effects. The delta N-15 value of total plant biomass increased significantly with increased soil moisture content at both CO2 levels, possibly due to increased uptake of N-15-rich organic N. Although not adequately replicated, plant biomass delta N-15 was lower under elevated than under ambient CO2 after adjusting for plant N uptake effects. Thus, increases in soil moisture can increase plant biomass delta N-15, while elevated CO2 can decrease plant biomass delta N-15 other than by modifying soil moisture.

TI  - Linkage Between Dissolved Organic Matter Transformation, Bacterial Carbon Production, and Diversity in a Shallow Oligotrophic Aquifer: Results From Flow-Through Sediment Microcosm Experiments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Aquifers are important reservoirs for organic carbon. A fundamental understanding of the role of groundwater ecosystems in carbon cycling, however, is still missing. Using sediment flow-through microcosms, long-term (171d) experiments were conducted to test two scenarios. First, aquifer sediment microbial communities received dissolved organic matter (DOM) at low concentration and typical to groundwater in terms of composition (DOM-1x). Second, sediments received an elevated concentration of DOM originating from soil (DOM-5x). Changes in DOM composition were analyzed via NMR and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Carbon production, physiological adaptations and biodiversity of groundwater, and sediment prokaryotic communities were monitored by total cell counts, substrate use arrays, and deep amplicon sequencing. The experiments showed that groundwater microbial communities do not react very fast to the sudden availability of labile organic carbon from soil in terms of carbon degradation and biomass production. It took days to weeks for incoming DOM being efficiently degraded and pronounced cell production occurred. Once conditioned, the DOM-1x supplied sediments mineralized 294(+/- 230) mu gC L-sed(-1) d(-1), 10-times less than the DOM-5x fed sediment communities [2.9(+/- 1.1) mgC L-sed(-1) d(-1)]. However, the overall biomass carbon production was hardly different in the two treatments with 13.7(+/- 4.8) mu gC L-sed(-1) d(-1) and 14.3(+/- 3.5) mu gC L-sed(-1) d(-1), respectively, hinting at a significantly lower carbon use efficiency with higher DOM availability. However, the molecularly more diverse DOM from soil fostered a higher bacterial diversity. Taking the irregular inputs of labile DOM into account, shallow aquifers are assumed to have a low resilience. Lacking a highly active and responsive microbial community, oligotrophic aquifers are at high risk of contamination with organic chemicals.

TI  - Nitrogen fertilizer dose alters fungal communities in sugarcane soil and rhizosphere
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Fungi play important roles as decomposers, plant symbionts and pathogens in soils. The structure of fungal communities in the rhizosphere is the result of complex interactions among selection factors that may favour beneficial or detrimental relationships. Using culture-independent fungal community profiling, we have investigated the effects of nitrogen fertilizer dosage on fungal communities in soil and rhizosphere of field-grown sugarcane. The results show that the concentration of nitrogen fertilizer strongly modifies the composition but not the taxon richness of fungal communities in soil and rhizosphere. Increased nitrogen fertilizer dosage has a potential negative impact on carbon cycling in soil and promotes fungal genera with known pathogenic traits, uncovering a negative effect of intensive fertilization.

TI  - Early-stage effects of carbon-rich soil amendments stimulate retention-related nitrogen genes while maintaining nitrogen and yield levels
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Understanding the effects of soil amendments and low disturbance practices on soil health, nutrient cycling and microbial activity is essential for improving agricultural sustainability. Ramial chipped wood (RCW) is a promising carbon-rich organic soil amendment but its effects on microbial activity, nitrogen (N) cycling genes and microbial taxa, particularly across soil depth, remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of RCW applications following a no-till practice on various soil properties including microbial composition and N cycling genes, during the second year after RCW incorporation. The experiment was conducted using tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) as a crop species in the Mediterranean region. We compared the surface (0-20 cm) and subsurface (20-25 cm) metagenomes of RCW-treated soils with those treated with standard N-rich organic pellet, as a control, (CTL) and compost (CMP). RCW, particularly at high doses (RCW-HD), increased soil organic carbon and microbial biomass at an early stage. Despite a 50 % reduction in organic fertiliser use, RCW-HD did not reduce N availability and crop productivity, suggesting improved N use efficiency. Several N-cycling gene abundances were elevated under CTL compared to RCW-HD, including the nitrification-related pmoA-amoA (+42 %) and pmoC-amoC (+72 %), and the denitrification-related nosZ (+14 %). The RCW-HD no-till system increased nitrate reduction assimilation (+13 % nrtABC) and favoured N-fixing bacterial genera such as Terrihabitans, Ferriphaselus, Azospira and Rhodopseudomonas. Soil depth significantly influenced 72 % of the N-cycling genes, with key genes being more abundant at the surface. These results highlight the potential of RCW to improve N retention and soil fertility, while reducing fertiliser dependence and greenhouse gas emissions. They also support sustainable practices in regenerative agriculture by highlighting how micro-biomes contribute to the efficiency of nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Response of methanotrophic activity and community structure to plant invasion in China's coastal wetlands
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Coastal wetlands are critical in the global carbon budget while vulnerable to plant invasion. Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), a typical invasive plant species, has rapidly expanded in China's coastal area since 1979, which disturbed the carbon cycle of the coastal wetland ecosystems. However, until now, the effect and underlying mechanisms of S. alterniflora invasion on methanotrophs are poorly known in coastal wetlands. Here, a largescale investigation of the activity, abundance and community structure of methanotrophs was conducted in seven wetlands under both native (dominated by Phragmites australis, Kandelia candel or Avicennia marina) and invasive plants (dominated by S. alterniflora) across the southeast coast of China. Compared with the native community, S. alterniflora invasion led to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in activity and abundance of methanotrophs, which increased by 62.1% and 64.0% in average, respectively. The invasion of S. alterniflora did not greatly alter the methanotrophic community structure in most of the examined wetlands. However, the relative abundance of type I methanotrophs decreased under P. australis community, while type II methanotrophs (Methylocystis) increased after S. alterniflora invasion. In addition, the soil organic carbon content, ammonium content and salinity were identified as important environmental factors affecting the activity and community structure of methanotrophs. Overall, our results demonstrated that the activity and abundance of methanotrophs responded positively to S. alterniflora invasion, suggesting the important role of methanotrophs in reducing methane emissions from China's coastal wetlands.

TI  - Temperature, soil moisture, and microbial controls on CO2 and CH4 emissions from a permafrost peatland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB  - Peatlands are significant carbon dioxide (CO2) sinks and methane (CH4) sources. In this study, we investigated changes in CO2 and CH4 emissions from topsoil (0-20 cm) to subsoil (20-40 cm) in a permafrost peatland, and the related soil microbial abundance in response to increasing temperature and soil water content by using an incubation experiment. Our results indicated that CO2 and CH4 emissions from the permafrost peatland are highly sensitive to temperature and soil water content. CO2 emissions from topsoil and subsoil at 15 degrees C were 3.36 and 2.74 times larger, respectively, compared to those at 5 degrees C under the field moisture condition, and were 1.70 times larger under the waterlogged treatment in both topsoil and subsoil. CH4 emissions from 0-20 to 20-40 cm soils at 15 degrees C were 34 and 83 times larger, respectively, than those at 5 degrees C under the original state and 17 and 32 times larger under the waterlogged treatment. These results indicated that CH4 emissions are more sensitive than CO2 emissions, and waterlogged conditions could decrease temperature sensitivity of CO2 and CH4 emissions. Microbial analyses showed that the cumulative emissions amount of CO2 positively correlated with bacterial, fungal, and methanotroph abundances. Positive relationships were observed between CH4 emissions and abundances of bacteria, fungi, and archaea. These findings suggested that changes in temperature and water content alter CO2 and CH4 emissions from permafrost peatlands through controlling abundances of soil bacteria, fungi, archaea, and methanotrophs. These variables bear importance in accurately estimating C emissions from permafrost peatlands.

TI  - Ammonia Oxidation by the Arctic Terrestrial Thaumarchaeote Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus arcticus Is Stimulated by Increasing Temperatures
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Climate change is causing arctic regions to warm disproportionally faster than those at lower latitudes, leading to alterations in carbon and nitrogen cycling, and potentially higher greenhouse gas emissions. It is thus increasingly important to better characterize the microorganisms driving arctic biogeochemical processes and their potential responses to changing conditions. Here, we describe a novel thaumarchaeon enriched from an arctic soil, Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus arcticus strain Kfb, which has been maintained for seven years in stable laboratory enrichment cultures as an aerobic ammonia oxidizer, with ammonium or urea as substrates. Genomic analyses show that this organism harbors all genes involved in ammonia oxidation and in carbon fixation via the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, characteristic of all AOA, as well as the capability for urea utilization and potentially also for heterotrophic metabolism, similar to other AOA. Ca. N. arcticus oxidizes ammonia optimally between 20 and 28 degrees C, well above average temperatures in its native high arctic environment (-3-4 degrees C). Ammonia oxidation rates were nevertheless much lower than those of most cultivated mesophilic AOA (20-45 degrees C). Intriguingly, we repeatedly observed apparent faster growth rates (based on marker gene counts) at lower temperatures (4-8 degrees C) but without detectable nitrite production. Together with potential metabolisms predicted from its genome content, these observations indicate that Ca. N. arcticus is not a strict chemolithotrophic ammonia oxidizer and add to cumulating evidence for a greater metabolic and physiological versatility of AOA. The physiology of Ca. N. arcticus suggests that increasing temperatures might drastically affect nitrification in arctic soils by stimulating archaeal ammonia oxidation.

T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
CP  - 11th Biennial Symposium for Environmental Biogeochemistry
AB  - The interactions between processes of the nitrogen cycle and nitrogen uptake by plants of winter wheat on an arable gray forest soil were examined. Nitrogen immobilized by microorganisms and inorganic nitrogen demonstrated opposite behavior: Microbial N increased while inorganic N decreased. Nitrogen uptake by plants was favored by mineralization of microbial nitrogen. To describe nitrogen immobilization by microorganisms, remineralization, gaseous losses, and nitrogen uptake by plants, a first-order model was used. In arable gray forest soil at least 70% of N-15 in the plant crop was derived from remineralized microbial nitrogen. Microbial biomass was found to be one of the main sources of nitrogen in plant nutrition and the important factor controlling nitrogen uptake by plants.

TI  - Nitrogen Significantly Affected N Cycling Functional Gene Abundances Compared with Phosphorus and Drought in an Alpine Meadow
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Human activities and global climate change have greatly increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs and altered precipitation patterns in alpine meadows. Functional genes are important indicators of microorganisms that drive the nitrogen cycling process; however, the functional gene responses of soil nitrogen cycling to soil N and P availability and drought remain unclear. Separate or combined treatments of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization and drought were conducted on the Zoige Wetland in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the abundances of nitrification functional genes AOA amoA and AOB amoA and denitrification functional genes nirS, nirK, and nosZ were measured to explore the response of functional genes to these treatments. Seven treatments, including control (CK), N addition (N), P addition (P), 50% reduction in precipitation (D), N and P addition (NP), N addition with drought (ND), and NP addition with drought (NPD), were investigated. The results indicated that N application significantly increased AOB amoA abundance, while P application and drought had no significant effects on the abundance of functional genes. The combined treatment of N and P addition and drought increased AOB amoA abundance but did not significantly affect AOA amoA abundance, suggesting that AOB amoA was more responsive to soil N and P availability and moisture change than AOA amoA. However, the abundance of denitrification functional genes was not affected by these treatments. Denitrification functional genes were less sensitive to soil N and P availability and moisture change than nitrification functional genes. The integrated effects of N addition, P addition, and drought did not affect the abundance of the above N cycling functional genes. These results indicate that AOB amoA may play a more critical role in the process of ammonia oxidation than AOA amoA in alpine meadows, and the denitrification genes (nirK, nirS, and nosZ) were better than ammoxidation genes (AOA and AOB) at adapting to the soil environmental changes caused by increasing N and P deposition and drought in alpine meadows.

TI  - Response of the nosZ-type denitrifying microbial community and metabolic characteristics to precipitation changes in the alpine wetland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The impact of climate change on the global hydrological cycle is becoming increasingly significant, with changes in precipitation patterns emerging as a key factor influencing the carbon and nitrogen cycling processes in alpine wetland ecosystems. However, the response of the nosZ-type denitrifying microbial community and its metabolic characteristics in the source wetland to precipitation changes remains unclear. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of the nosZ gene and LC-MS-based metabolomics were used to investigate the response of the nosZ-type denitrifying microbial community and its metabolic characteristics to precipitation changes (4 years) in the source wetland of Qinghai Lake. The results showed that Microvirga was the key bacterial group in the source wetland of Qinghai Lake, and Azospirillum was sensitive to changes in precipitation (P < 0.05). The 50% rainfall enhancement treatment significantly increased soil moisture, and the total carbon content showed an increasing trend with the increase in precipitation (P < 0.05). pH was the most important explanatory factor for community structure, while total nitrogen content was the key explanatory factor for community diversity. Deterministic processes dominated the assemblage of the nosZ-type denitrifying microbial community in the source wetland of Qinghai Lake. Soil metabolomics analysis showed that the differential metabolites in the Source Wetland mostly exhibited significant positive correlations. Precipitation changes significantly affected the relative abundance of N-Acetylaspartic acid. In summary, lower precipitation is more favorable for maintaining carbon storage in the source wetlands of Qinghai Lake. Precipitation variation disrupted the existing nitrogen balance within the ecosystem and altered the structure of the nosZ-type denitrifying microbial community and soil metabolic characteristics. These findings imply that climate change-driven shifts in precipitation patterns may impact carbon and nitrogen dynamics in alpine wetlands, alter ecosystem stability, and have profound effects on microbial communities and biogeochemical cycles.

TI  - Variation in surface and subsurface nitrogen cycling in headwater floodplain wetlands due to soil type and wetland condition
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Headwater wetlands intercept, store, and transform nitrogen inputs from the landscape. However, uncertainties in rate estimates for processes such as denitrification in surface and subsurface soils hinder our ability to quantitatively predict the downstream water quality benefits of these headwater systems. We measured nitrogen pools and fluxes from surface (0 to 10 cm) and subsurface soils (similar to 50 cm) of six headwater wetlands of low and high ecological condition (based on anthropogenic stressors) across three hydric soil types (Atkins, Holly, Udifluvent-Dystrochrept Complex). We quantified net nitrification (- 0.027 to 0.113 mg N kg soil(-1) day(-1)), net ammonification (- 0.159 to 1.683 mg N kg soil(-1) day(-1)), and potential denitrification rates (0.12 to 17.05 mg N kg soil(-1) day(-1)) in surface soils during the fall. We also quantified potential denitrification rates in subsurface soils at 4 of the 6 sites in fall and spring (0.005 to 0.177 mg N kg soil(-1) day(1)). Potential denitrification rates in surface soils varied with soil type, and rates were positively correlated with ground cover and the percentage of time the water level was between 0 and 10 cm below the surface. Potential denitrification rates of subsurface soil did not vary between condition groups or seasons; however, nitrous oxide yield was higher in the spring compared to the fall. At the plot scale, potential denitrification rates in surface soils were correlated with ammonification rates, and rates in subsurface soils were correlated with conductivity and ammonium levels. This work demonstrates the variability in surface and subsurface soil nitrogen cycling and highlights the need to investigate nutrient dynamics at multiple soil depths to accurately quantify the role of headwater wetlands in nitrogen removal at regional scales where soil properties are highly variable.

TI  - Quarry restoration treatments from recycled waste modify the physicochemical soil properties, composition and activity of bacterial communities and priming effect in semi-arid areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The selection of a suitable organic amendment for recovery of semi-arid soils degraded by mining is key to the success of an ecological restoration. The aim of this research is to study the short-term responses of physicochemical, biochemical and biological properties, as well as the changes of a soil bacterial community at the genus level after application of five types of organic amendments in a limestone quarry in Almeria (SE, Spain). The relationship among bacterial taxa with biochemical and physicochemical properties and priming effect from restored soils was also analysed. Six months after the application of organic amendments, the values of different soil status, such as total organic carbon, total nitrogen, assimilable phosphorus and labile organic matter forms (carbohydrates and polyphenols), basal respiration (BR) and enzymatic activities increased significantly with respect to unrestored soils. Similarly, a positive priming effect of soil organic matter mineralisation was produced by all organic amendments, being significantly higher (p < 0.05) in sewage sludge-treated soils. Bacterial diversity was higher in restored than in control soils. The restoration caused changes in soil bacterial communities' composition at the phylum and genus levels. It was observed that soil bacterial communities were significantly related to several physical, chemical and biochemical soil properties, establishing two different co-occurrence patterns between restored and unrestored soils. A first bacterial co-occurrence pattern showed significant positive correlations to pH and C/N ratio and negativity with the rest of the soil properties. The second bacterial pattern was positively correlated with carbohydrates, mu g of C, priming effect, BR, beta-glucosidase and phosphatase and negatively with pH and C/N ratio. It was concluded that soil bacterial communities are clearly influenced by the types of organic amendments applied. Bacterial taxa such as Taibaiella or Pseudomonas could perform key functions in the carbon cycle in restored soils. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Species richness of ectomycorrhizal hyphal necromass increases soil CO2 efflux under laboratory conditions
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The ectomycorrhizal mycelium is a large component of boreal and temperate forest soil microbial biomass and the resulting necromass is likely to be an important source of nutrients for saprotrophic microorganisms. Here we test the effects of species richness of ectomycorrhizal mycelial biomass on short-term CO2 efflux by amending forest soil with necromass from 8 fungal species added separately and in mixtures of 2, 4 and 8 species. All additions of necromass rapidly increased soil CO2 efflux compared to unamended controls but CO2 efflux increased significantly with species richness. Efflux of CO2 did not correlate with the carbon (C) or nitrogen (N) contents or the C:N ratio of the added necromass. The study demonstrates that species diversity of dead ectomycorrhizal fungal hyphae can have important consequences for soil CO2 efflux, and suggests decomposition of hyphae is regulated by specific constituents of the nutrient pools in the necromass rather than the total quantities added.

TI  - Linking Phyllostachys edulis (moso bamboo) growth with soil nitrogen cycling and microbial community of plant-soil system: Effects of plant age and niche differentiation
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - Understanding the impacts of plant age on bamboo growth, soil nutrient and functional microorganism can assist in the development of management practices to maximize the benefits of nutrients and functional endophytic and soil microbes in moso bamboo plantations. In this study, moso bamboos of different ages (0.5, 2.5, 4.5 and 6.5 years) were selected. The above-ground biomass, soil properties and endophytic microbes of above-ground tissue and stump root of different age bamboos were quantified, and their interactive relationships were also examined. There were negligible differences in the heights and above-ground fresh biomass among the bamboo plants of different ages, but net nitrogen (N) mineralization and potential nitrification rates of soils were significantly affected by the bamboo ages. The soil nprA gene abundances decreased with the bamboo ages, and soil AOB amoA gene abundances of the 0.5-yr bamboo were significantly higher than those of the other older plants. Average soil urease activities of the 2.5-yr, 4.5-yr and 6.5-yr bamboos were 81.4%, 81.1% and 88.2% lower than those of the 0.5-yr bamboo, respectively. Bacterial diversity indices and richness estimators in the soils were significantly higher than those in the above-ground tissues. Endophytic microbial community structures were more sensitive to the bamboo ages than the soil counterparts, and endophytic microbial community diversities and structures in the above-ground tissues were significantly changed with the bamboo ages. Bacterial and fungal community structures in the above-ground tissues were significantly different from those in the soils. Bamboo ages significantly affected the N transformations in the soils and endophytic community structures, but niche differentiations among the above-ground tissue, stump root and soil outweighed the plant ages in shaping the whole microbial communities of plant-soil system.

TI  - Soil phosphorus cycling microbial functional genes of monoculture and mixed plantations of native tree species in subtropical China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Background: Transforming coniferous plantation into broadleaved or mixed broadleaved-coniferous plantations is the tendency of forest management strategies in subtropical China. However, the effects of this conversion on soil phosphorus (P) cycling microbial functional genes are still unknown. Methods: Soil samples were collected from 0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm (topsoil, middle layer, and subsoil, respectively) under coniferous Pinus massoniana (PM), broadleaved Erythrophleum fordii (EF), and their mixed (PM/EF) plantation in subtropical China. Used metagenomic sequencing to examine the alterations of relative abundances and molecular ecological network structure of soil P-cycling functional genes after the conversion of plantations. Results: The composition of P-cycling genes in the topsoil of PM stand was significantly different from that of PM/EF and EF stands (p < 0.05), and total phosphorus (TP) was the main factor causing this difference. After transforming PM plantation into EF plantation, the relative abundances of P solubilization and mineralization genes significantly increased in the topsoil and middle layer with the decrease of soil TP content. The abundances of P-starvation response regulation genes also significantly increased in the subsoil (p < 0.05), which may have been influenced by soil organic carbon (SOC). The dominant genes in all soil layers under three plantations were phoR, glpP, gcd, ppk, and ppx. Transforming PM into EF plantation apparently increased gcd abundance in the topsoil (p < 0.05), with TP and NO3--N being the main influencing factors. After transforming PM into PM/EF plantations, the molecular ecological network structure of P-cycling genes was more complex; moreover, the key genes in the network were modified with the transformation of PM plantation. Conclusion: Transforming PM into EF plantation mainly improved the phosphate solubilizing potential of microorganisms at topsoil, while transforming PM into PM/EF plantation may have enhanced structural stability of microbial P-cycling genes react to environmental changes.

TI  - Soil erosion accelerates carbon cycling as a response to carbon limitation in erosion-prone sloping cropland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
AB  - Soil erosion accelerates the loss of soil carbon (C) pools and then exacerbates the microbial C limitation. However, the extent to which soil microbial C limitation influences soil C cycling processes in different erosion environments remains unclear. We analyzed the differences in soil organic carbon (SOC) content, extracellular enzyme activities and C limitation between sloping cropland and adjacent forestland in a typical small watershed, and further explored the relationship between soil C limitation and the abundance of C cycling genes in different erosion environments. The results revealed that sloping cropland exhibited a 31.70 % higher soil erodibility (K-erosion) compared to forestland, making it more prone to soil erosion. Moreover, the SOC content in sloping cropland was 61.72 % lower than that in forestland. Although there was no significant difference in absolute enzyme activities between sloping cropland and forestland, the specific enzyme activities per unit of SOC (including carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus enzymes) in sloping cropland were significantly higher than those in forestland. The loss of SOC further exacerbated C limitation in sloping cropland and stimulated an increase in the abundance of C cycle genes involved in complex organic C degradation. Additionally, the C cycling genes enriched in sloping cropland demonstrated a significant positive correlation with soil CO2 emissions (p < 0.01). Therefore, we emphasize that soil erosion stimulates an increase in the abundance of C cycle genes, particularly those involved in complex SOC degradation, as a response to C limitation in erosion-prone sloping cropland. The findings provide scientific support for developing effective soil and water conservation measures to reduce soil C loss and maintain the ecological balance of sloping cropland.

TI  - Long-term conversion from rice-wheat to rice-vegetable rotations drives variation in soil microbial communities and shifts in nitrogen-cycling through soil profiles
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Land-use change (LUC) caused by agricultural intensification has aggravated soil reactive nitrogen (Nr) pollution in global rice agroecosystems. Microorganisms mediate Nr transformation; however, the structural and functional responses of the microbial community to LUC and soil Nr loading have yet to be synthesized. Simultaneously, rice-wheat (RW) rotations in China have been subjected to high rates of LUC, primarily to intensive rice-vegetable (RV) rotations. Here, 16S rRNA gene sequencing coupled with Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt2) was performed to assess the influence of conversion from RW to RV on soil Nr fractions, microbial communities, and N-cycling genes, especially over longer time scales and at deeper soil depths. Compared to RW, bacterial alpha-diversity increased in the 10-year RV, whereas archaeal alpha-diversity decreased with increasing years under RV rotations. Microbial beta-diversity significantly decreased after the conversion from RW to RV rotations, resulting in reduced heterogeneity in community structure (composition and abundance) across 0-40 cm soil profiles in RV rotations. Redundancy analysis suggested that this homogenization was driven by increased concentrations of nitrate N and decreased soil pH and soluble organic N concentrations in the RV. At 0-20 cm, RV decreased the abundance of Geobacter spp., Candidatus_Nitrosotalea spp., and their related N-fixation genes, whereas it increased the abundance of Streptomyces spp. and their related nitrification genes. Moreover, the 20-year RV significantly increased the potential denitrification and N2O emissions from soil at 0-40 cm by decreasing the abundance of bacterial nosZ genes (encoding nitrous-oxide reductase) and increasing archaeal nirK, nirS (nitrite reductase) genes, and bacterial norB and norC genes (nitric-oxide reductase). Collectively, RW-to-RV conversion decreased soil microbial diversity and increased the size of denitrification/N2O-producing communities, this homogenization of microbiomes in long-term RV system may be a potential source of N2O.

TI  - Multivariate assessment of soil quality indicators for crop rotation and tillage in Illinois
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - The long-term implementation of crop rotation and tillage influences the soil environment through inputs and disturbance of the soil, which in turn, impact soil quality (SQ). A vital component of developing sustainable agronomic practices is to evaluate their effect on SQ. The objective of this study is to address the first step in this process by identifying soil parameters that are sensitive to changes in the soil and indicative of soil functions. Soil samples were collected from two Illinois sites with cropping systems and tillage treatments in place for more than 16 years. Crop rotation and tillage were evaluated with separate principal component analyses (PCA) of 20 soil parameters. Six principal components accounted for 74% of variability among rotations. The soil parameters loaded within these components highlighted the strong influence on carbon and nitrogen cycling indicated by greater soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial biomass, and aggregate stability under crop rotations with high C:N residues and biomass production. Other strongly loaded parameters, such as soil pH and nutrient contents, are likely related to the use of nitrogenous fertilizers in grass species. Rotations with only a single contrasting crop were able to be differentiated readily while the multi-species crop rotations were only marginally able to be separated. The PCA for tillage explained 73% of variability with six principal components; of those, three were able to separate no-till from conventional tillage. As with rotation, the choice of tillage practice can have a large influence on the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, as decomposition of residues and soil organic matter are accelerated by tillage. No-till was also associated with stratification of pH and other nutrients. Soil parameters relating to carbon and nitrogen cycling have the greatest potential as SQ indicators while other measures relating to nitrogen fertilization, such as shifts in soil pH and nutrient contents, can also prove useful in comparing SQ under crop rotation and tillage in Illinois.

TI  - Changes in the composition of soil microbial communities and their carbon-cycle genes following the conversion of primary broadleaf forests to plantations and secondary forests
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The soil organic carbon (C) cycle is primarily mediated by soil microorganisms and their genes that function in the C cycle (C-cycle genes), both of which are strongly affected by land cover disturbance. However, the mechanism underlying microbially mediated soil C loss after conversion of primary natural broadleaf forests (BF) to plantation forests (PF) and secondary forests (SF) remains unknown. Here, we measured soil physicochemical properties and soil microbial community properties, and examined their linkages with microbial C-cycle genes. Forest conversion dramatically decreased the richness of the soil fungal community but not of the bacterial community, and altered the composition of both communities. Analysis of C-cycle genes revealed that the abundance of genes associated with C fixation, methane metabolism, and C degradation decreased by 51.3%, 57.9%, and 67.0%, respectively with the conversion of BF to PF; and by 6.3%, 4.1%, and 15.6%, respectively, with the conversion of BF to SF. The reductions in the abundance of C-cycle genes, especially the reduction of hemicellulose- and lignin-degradation genes, were primarily associated with the declines in the abundance of forest conversion-sensitive microbes indexed by operational taxonomic units (fsOTUs, beta = 0.41). fsOTUs were taxonomically diverse and included members frequently co-occurring with numerous other microbes in the microbial communities, indicating that the manipulation of fsOTUs by forest management could improve soil fertility and soil C sequestration. Forest conversion-induced shifts in fsOTUs abundance were associated with changes in soil potassium permanganate oxidizable organic carbon (PXC) concentration, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, and soil pH. Our results indicate that alterations in soil substrate supply (e.g., DOC and PXC) and soil pH induced by forest conversion may strongly shape fsOTUs structure and decrease the abundance of hemicellulose and lignin degradation genes, and consequently increase C loss.

TI  - Interactions between physical and biotic factors influence CO2 flux in Antarctic dry valley soils
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) flux is an integrative measure of ecosystem functioning representing both biotic and physical controls over carbon (C) balance. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, Soil CO2 fluxes (approximately -0.1-0.15 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) are generally low, and negative fluxes (uptake Of CO2) are sometimes observed. A combination of biological respiration and physical mechanisms. driven by temperature and mediated by soil moisture and mineralogy, determine CO2 flux and, therefore, soil organic C balance. The physical factors important to CO2 flux are being altered with climate variability in many ecosystems including and forms such as the Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, making it critical to understand how climate factors interact with biotic drivers to control Soil CO2 fluxes and C balances. We measured soil CO2 flux in experimental field manipulations, microcosm incubations and across natural environmental gradients of soil moisture to estimate biotic soil respiration and abiotic sources Of CO2 flux in soils over a range of physical and biotic conditions. We determined that temperature fluctuations were the most important factor influencing diel variation in CO2 flux. Variation within these diel CO2 cycles was explained by differences in soil moisture. Increased temperature (as opposed to temperature fluctuations) had little or no effect on CO2 flux if Moisture was not also increased. We conclude that CO2 flux in dry valley soils is driven primarily by physical factors such as soil temperature and moisture, indicating that future climate change may alter the dry valley soil C cycle. Negative CO2 fluxes in and soils have recently been identified as potential net C sinks. We demonstrate the potential for and polar soils to take UP CO2, driven largely by abiotic factors associated with climate change. The low levels Of CO2 absorption into soils we observed may not constitute a significant sink of atmospheric CO2, but will influence the interpretation Of CO2 flux for the dry valley soil C cycle and possibly other and environments where biotic controls over C cycling are secondary to physical drivers.

TI  - Long term tillage regime alters bacterial assimilation of xylose and cellulose
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Microbial growth dynamics determine carbon fate in soil by transforming carbon inputs into microbial products available for stabilization on soil surfaces. Management practices such as tillage disturb microbial communities and promote C loss, but the degree to which tillage alters bacterial metabolism of soil C remains poorly described. We conducted a multi-substrate DNA stable isotope probing experiment using soil from a long-term field experiment with a 42-year legacy of either no-till or annual moldboard plowing. We predicted that this land use history would alter C assimilation dynamics due to differences in bacterial growth responses. We incubated soil from each tillage regime with 13C-xylose and 13C-cellulose, substrates that differ in bioavailability and which favor different bacterial life history strategies in soil. We identified 730 13C-labeled bacterial taxa and tracked their abundance in bulk soil over a 30 day period. Carbon addition to soil rapidly altered bacterial community structure and function. 13C-labeling dynamics differed substantially between tilled and no-till soils with respect to both xylose and cellulose. Bacterial xylose metabolism in tilled soils exhibited substantial lag relative to no-till soils, and this lag corresponded with lower mineralization rates for xylose. In addition, bacterial cellulose metabolism was mediated primarily by specialist taxa in no-till soils, while dual incorporators dominated tilled soils. Differences in carbon assimilation corresponded to lower cellulose mineralization rates and cumulative cellulose mineralization in tilled soils. We show that soil management practices shape the path of carbon through bacterial communities by altering dynamic growth responses associated with bacterial life history strategies.IMPORTANCEWe applied DNA stable isotope probing in a microcosm experiment to understand the role of soil management (till vs no-till) in shaping bacterial carbon cycling. Our hypothesis was that a legacy of disturbance through tillage would exert a selective influence on bacterial growth dynamics, thereby altering bacterial processing of added carbon substrates. We found that lagged growth in tilled soil resulted in delayed bacterial assimilation of xylose and a streamlined, single carbon "channel" characterized by the co-metabolism of xylose and cellulose. In no-till soil, temporally distinct bacterial assimilation of xylose and cellulose by separate carbon "channels" was associated with higher carbon mineralization rates and total mineralization relative to tilled soil. Our findings indicate that soil management practices altered the growth dynamics of active carbon cycling bacteria. Lagged growth associated with a history of disturbance resulted in reduced carbon mineralization.

TI  - Aridity threshold in controlling ecosystem nitrogen cycling in arid and semi-arid grasslands
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Higher aridity and more extreme rainfall events in drylands are predicted due to climate change. Yet, it is unclear how changing precipitation regimes may affect nitrogen (N) cycling, especially in areas with extremely high aridity. Here we investigate soil N isotopic values (delta N-15) along a 3,200 km aridity gradient and reveal a hump-shaped relationship between soil delta N-15 and aridity index (AI) with a threshold at AI = 0.32. Variations of foliar delta N-15, the abundance of nitrification and denitrification genes, and metabolic quotient along the gradient provide further evidence for the existence of this threshold. Data support the hypothesis that the increase of gaseous N loss is higher than the increase of net plant N accumulation with increasing AI below AI = 0.32, while the opposite is favoured above this threshold. Our results highlight the importance of N-cycling microbes in extremely dry areas and suggest different controlling factors of N-cycling on either side of the threshold.

TI  - Modeling Mycorrhizal Carbon Costs in Temperate Forests: The Impacts of Functional Diversity and Global Change Factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with most plant species, facilitating nutrient acquisition while consuming a significant fraction of the plant's photosynthetic carbon (C), which we define as the mycorrhizal C cost. Drivers of the mycorrhizal C cost, which is crucial for predicting environmental impacts on plant productivity, remain under-explored and difficult to quantify. Ecosystem models that incorporate mycorrhizae can offer insights into mycorrhizal C cost dynamics, but their predictions have rarely been validated against empirical data. In this study, we used the Myco-CORPSE model, which explicitly simulates mycorrhizal processes alongside soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, to investigate the drivers of mycorrhizal C cost in temperate forests. Applying this model to over 1,800 forest inventory plots across the eastern United States, we found that the simulations matched published data, showing higher C allocation to ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi (16.0% of net primary production (NPP)) compared to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (5.8% of NPP). Further analysis showed that mixed forests, co-dominated by both AM and ECM trees, allocated less C to mycorrhizal fungi compared to forests dominated by either AM or ECM fungi alone, due to complementary nutrient acquisition strategies. Elevated Nitrogen (N) deposition and higher temperatures reduce mycorrhizal C costs, favoring AM strategies. Conversely, elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) increased plant N demand and mycorrhizal C costs, favoring ECM strategies that access organic N sources. These findings underscore the critical role of mycorrhizal functional diversity in plant nutrient acquisition and C dynamics, providing new insights into how mycorrhizal symbioses respond to global change.

TI  - High nutrient loads amplify carbon cycling across California and New York coastal wetlands but with ambiguous effects on marsh integrity and sustainability
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Eutrophic conditions in estuaries are a globally important stressor to coastal ecosystems and have been suggested as a driver of coastal salt marsh loss. Potential mechanisms in marshes include disturbance caused by macroalgae accumulations, enhanced soil sulfide levels linked to high labile carbon inputs, accelerated decomposition, and declines in belowground biomass that contribute to edge instability, erosion, and slumping. However, results of fertilization studies have been mixed, and it is unclear the extent to which local environmental conditions, such as soil composition and nutrient profiles, help shape the response of salt marshes to nutrient exposure. In this study, we characterized belowground productivity and decomposition, organic matter mineralization rates, soil respiration, microbial biomass, soil humification, carbon and nitrogen inventories, nitrogen isotope ratios, and porewater profiles at high and low marsh elevations across eight marshes in four estuaries in California and New York that have strong contrasts in nutrient inputs. The higher nutrient load marshes were characterized by faster carbon turnover, with higher belowground production and decomposition and greater carbon dioxide efflux than lower nutrient load marshes. These patterns were robust across marshes of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts that varied in plant species composition, soil flooding patterns, and soil texture. Although impacts of eutrophic conditions on carbon cycling appeared clear, it was ambiguous whether high nutrient loads are causing negative effects on long-term marsh sustainability in terms of studied metrics. While high nutrient exposure marshes had high rates of decomposition and soil respiration rates, high nutrient exposure was also associated with increased belowground production, and reduced levels of sulfides, which should lead to greater marsh sustainability. While this study does not resolve the extent to which nutrient loads are negatively affecting these salt marshes, we do highlight functional differences between Atlantic and Pacific wetlands which may be useful for understanding coastal marsh health and integrity.

TI  - Biochar Enhances Soil Resource Availability and Suppresses Microbial Metabolism Genes in the Rhizosphere of Wheat
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Despite the well-documented role of biochar in promoting soil quality and crop productivity, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we explored the effects of straw biochar on soil microbiome in the rhizosphere from wheat using metagenomic sequencing. Our results showed that straw return decreased the yields of wheat, while the straw biochar return increased the wheat yields. Further, both the richness and community composition confirmed different effects of the straw return and straw biochar return. The straw biochar return also resulted in greater rhizosphere effects from wheat, represented by resource availability, including soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium. The rhizosphere effects from wheat, represented by microbial metabolism genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium cycling, however, were decreased by straw biochar returning. In addition, the rhizosphere effects from nitrogen content and the nitrogen cycling genes showed negative relationships with wheat yields. Together, these results revealed that straw biochar enhanced soil resource availability but suppressed microbial metabolism genes in the rhizosphere from wheat, supporting the idea that straw biochar serves as a nutrient pool for crops.

TI  - Changes in soil microbe-mediated carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling during spontaneous succession in abandoned Pb-Zn mining areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The mechanism through which soil microorganisms mediate carbon and nutrient cycling during mine wasteland restoration remained unknown. Using soil metagenome sequencing, we investigated the dynamic changes in soil microbial potential metabolic functions during the transition from biological soil crusts (BSC) to mixed broadconifer forest (MBF) in a typical Pb-Zn mine. The results showed soil microorganisms favored carbon sequestration through anaerobic and microaerobic pathways, predominantly using efficient, low-energy pathways during succession. Genes governing carbon degradation and aerobic respiration increased by 19.56 % and 24.79 %, respectively, reflecting change toward more efficient and intensive soil carbon utilization in late succession. Nitrogen-cycling genes mediated by soil microorganisms met their maximum influence during early succession (sparse grassland, SGL), leading to a respective increase of 75.29 % and 76.81 % in the net potential nitrification rate and total nitrogen content. Mantel and correlation analyses indicated that TOC, TN, Zn and Cd contents were the main factors affecting the soil carbon and phosphorus cycles. Soil AP content emerged as the primary influencer of genes associated with the nitrogen cycle. These results shed light on the dynamic shifts in microbial metabolic activities during succession, providing a genetic insight into biogeochemical cycling mechanisms and underscoring crucial factors influencing soil biogeochemical processes in mining regions.

TI  - Soil microbe-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling during primary succession of biological soil crusts in tailings ponds
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tailings ponds resulting from mining operations have led to serious environmental hazards, and their bioremediation is an area of ongoing exploration. Primary succession represents the starting point of biotic community establishment and development, with soil carbon and nitrogen cycling being critical to this process. To investigate the soil microbialmediated carbon and nitrogen cycling patterns accompanying primary succession, we selected three types of tailings ponds as study areas and set up sampling sites for different stages of primary succession. The results showed that primary succession promoted microbe-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling. It also led to improvements in soil nutrient availability and enzyme activity. In primary succession, the main pathways of carbon cycling are 3HP and rTCA, and nitrogen cycling is nitrate assimilation. In the early stages, microbes mediated more anaerobic and microaerobic processes. As succession proceeded, the pattern of microbial contributions to the carbon and nitrogen cycles changed. As succession proceeds, the functional metabolic potential of the carbon cycle gradually rises, while the nitrogen cycle shows a dramatic increase after the accumulation of autotrophic biomass. In addition, we found a positive coupling pattern between the carbon and nitrogen cycles. These findings support the optimization of bioremediation strategies for tailings ponds.

TI  - Alteration in nitrogen cycle and its contribution to climate change: a review
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
AB  - Human activities have disrupted the global nitrogen cycle, fundamentally altered Earth's biogeochemical processes and accelerated climate change. Reactive nitrogen in the environment has increased 400% since pre-industrial times. In contrast, nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas 265 times more potent than CO2, has risen 20% in atmospheric concentrations due to agriculture and fossil fuel use. This comprehensive review analyses natural and anthropogenic nitrogen sources, showing how synthetic fertilizers, livestock operations, and industrial emissions create cascading environmental impacts across terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric systems. Nitrogen pollution triggers water body eutrophication, soil acidification, biodiversity loss, and disrupted carbon sequestration. Complex feedback loops between nitrogen and carbon cycles amplify climate impacts, while agricultural runoff creates hypoxic dead zones threatening ecosystem stability. Evidence-based mitigation strategies include precision agriculture, enhanced fertilizer management, emission controls, and policy interventions, emphasizing urgent need for integrated approaches to restore nitrogen cycle balance.

TI  - Reforestation significantly enriches soil microbial carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling genes but simplifies their co-occurrence network
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Reforestation serves as one of the most effective strategies for mitigating global warming, but a comprehensive understanding of its impact on soil microbial biogeochemical cycling functions remains lacking. In this study, we collected paired reforested and cropland soils from 30 sites in the southwestern China to comprehensively investigate the impacts of reforestation on soil microbial functional genes related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling. Microbial diversity, functional profiles, and functional gene copies were determined through amplicon sequencing, metagenomic analysis, and real-time PCR. We found that reforestation significantly decreased the average copy number of the 16S rRNA operon and altered the soil microbial community structure. Reforestation also substantially increased the abundances of most microbial functional genes involved in carbon (e.g., carbon degradation and fixation), nitrogen (e.g., nitrogen fixation, ammonia oxidation, and denitrification), and phosphorus (e.g., inorganic phosphorus solubilization, organic phosphorus mineralization, and phosphorus transportation) cycling. The carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling gene abundances were significantly correlated with multiple environmental factors, including soil moisture, total nitrogen, total carbon, and NH4+-N, in both cropland and reforested ecosystems. Notably, they showed significant correlations with the soil available potassium and NO3--N contents specifically within the reforested soils rather than the cropland soils. Additionally, reforestation substantially simplified the co-occurrence network constructed with soil microbial carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling genes. The results collectively indicate that reforestation can substantially enhance soil microbial biogeochemical cycling functions but reshape their co-occurrence pattern, providing critical information for assessing the ecological impacts of reforestation projects on ecosystem health.

TI  - Effect of soil microbial community on ecosystem multifunctionality in an alpine grassland
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Soil microbial communities are crucial in enabling ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). However, the regulatory effects of biotic and abiotic factors on ecosystem function and EMF still need further study, under the background of altitude at large regional scales. We established a 1500-km sampling area along the altitude gradient in alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. With increasing altitude, bacterial and fungal community diversity increased, microbial network complexity and EMF showed unimodal variation patterns, range of 0.36-0.48. EMF thresholds exist at 3786 m altitude. At this threshold, maximum means occurred for productivity indicators (0.24), carbon cycling indicators (0.080), nitrogen cycling indicators (0.026), and phosphorus cycle indicators (0.0089). Bacterial communities are more sensitive than fungal communities to changes in altitude, vegetation and pH. Annual mean temperature (MAT) modifies soil microbial primarily indirectly through its effects on plants and soil. Both microbial diversity and network complexity are positively correlated with EMF, and microbial network complexity plays a more important role in predicting EMF. Bacterial communities are the main drivers of multifunctionality compared to fungi. MAT is the main environmental drivers of EMF. MAP, microbial diversity was positively correlated with productivity and nitrogen cycling indicators. Microbial network complexity was positively correlated with carbon and phosphorus cycle indicators. Our study demonstrates the significance of symbiotic networks as key components of microbial biomes for climate change buffering effects in alpine grasslands.

TI  - Microbial mediation of biogeochemical cycles revealed by simulation of global changes with soil transplant and cropping
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Despite microbes' key roles in driving biogeochemical cycles, the mechanism of microbe-mediated feedbacks to global changes remains elusive. Recently, soil transplant has been successfully established as a proxy to simulate climate changes, as the current trend of global warming coherently causes range shifts toward higher latitudes. Four years after southward soil transplant over large transects in China, we found that microbial functional diversity was increased, in addition to concurrent changes in microbial biomass, soil nutrient content and functional processes involved in the nitrogen cycle. However, soil transplant effects could be overridden by maize cropping, which was attributed to a negative interaction. Strikingly, abundances of nitrogen and carbon cycle genes were increased by these field experiments simulating global change, coinciding with higher soil nitrification potential and carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux. Further investigation revealed strong correlations between carbon cycle genes and CO2 efflux in bare soil but not cropped soil, and between nitrogen cycle genes and nitrification. These findings suggest that changes of soil carbon and nitrogen cycles by soil transplant and cropping were predictable by measuring microbial functional potentials, contributing to a better mechanistic understanding of these soil functional processes and suggesting a potential to incorporate microbial communities in greenhouse gas emission modeling.

TI  - Soil fertilization affects the abundance and distribution of carbon and nitrogen cycling genes in the maize rhizosphere
T2  - AMB EXPRESS
AB  - Soil microbes perform important functions in nitrogen and carbon cycling in the biosphere. Microbial communities in the rhizosphere enhance plants' health and promote nutrient turnover and cycling in the soil. In this study, we evaluated the effects of soil fertilization with organic and inorganic fertilizers on the abundances and distribution of carbon and nitrogen cycling genes within the rhizosphere of maize plants. Our result showed that maize plants through rhizosphere effects selected and enriched the same functional genes glnA, gltB, gudB involved in nitrogen cycle as do high compost and low inorganic fertilizer treatments. This observation was significantly different from those of high doses of inorganic fertilizer and low compost manure treated soil. Only alpha amylase encoding genes were selectively enriched by low compost and high inorganic fertilized soil. The other treatments only selected xynB (in Cp8), lacZ (Cp4), bglA, pldB, trpA (N2), uidA (N1) and glgC, vanA (Cn0) carbon cycling genes in the rhizosphere of maize. Also Actinomycetales are selected by high compost, low inorganic fertilizer and control. The control was without any fertilization and the soil was planted with maize. Bacillales are also promoted by low compost and high inorganic fertilizer. This indicated that only microbes capable of tolerating the stress of high dose of inorganic fertilizer will thrive under such condition. Therefore, soil fertilization lowers nitrogen gas emission as seen with the high abundance of nitrogen assimilation genes or microbial anabolic genes, but increases carbon dioxide evolution in the agricultural soil by promoting the abundance of catabolic genes involve in carbon cycling.

TI  - Herbivory makes major contributions to ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling in tropical forests
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - The functional role of herbivores in tropical rainforests remains poorly understood. We quantified the magnitude of, and underlying controls on, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycled by invertebrate herbivory along a 2800m elevational gradient in the tropical Andes spanning 12 degrees C mean annual temperature. We find, firstly, that leaf area loss is greater at warmer sites with lower foliar phosphorus, and secondly, that the estimated herbivore-mediated flux of foliar nitrogen and phosphorus from plants to soil via leaf area loss is similar to, or greater than, other major sources of these nutrients in tropical forests. Finally, we estimate that herbivores consume a significant portion of plant carbon, potentially causing major shifts in the pattern of plant and soil carbon cycling. We conclude that future shifts in herbivore abundance and activity as a result of environmental change could have major impacts on soil fertility and ecosystem carbon sequestration in tropical forests.

TI  - Effects of Deep Application of Fertilizer on Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Functions in Rice Paddies
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Efficient fertilization is vital for rice production and sustainable agriculture. Conventional fertilization (CK) suffers from low efficiency and environmental pollution, whereas side-deep fertilization (SF) offers an efficient, eco-friendly alternative. The changes in microbial carbon cycling functional genes induced by SF in paddy soils remain unclear. This study investigates the effects of SF and CK on soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), microbial communities, and carbon- and nitrogen-cycling genes in double-cropping rice paddies through field experiments. Results reveal that SF significantly increases TN in deeper soil layers (10-20 cm), enhancing the expression of nitrogen fixation genes (e.g., K02591 and K02588) and nitrogen metabolism pathways, alongside boosting Chloroflexi and Planctomycetes abundance. In contrast, CK promotes SOC accumulation and upregulates carbon metabolism genes (e.g., K01179 and K01728) in surface layers (0-10 cm). In deeper layers, SF elevates nitrogen reduction gene abundance (e.g., K02591) while suppressing denitrification and assimilatory nitrate reduction, whereas CK enhances dissimilatory nitrate reduction (e.g., K02568). Redundancy analysis (RDA) shows that soil properties (pH, SOC, and TN) drive microbial community structure, with Actinobacteria positively linked to SOC and TN. These findings demonstrate that SF optimizes nitrogen cycling in deeper soil by improving nitrogen use efficiency and functional microbial growth, while CK favors shallow-layer carbon sequestration. This study provides a scientific foundation for tailoring fertilization strategies to soil depth, leveraging carbon- and nitrogen-cycling gene dynamics to enhance soil fertility and sustainability in rice production.

TI  - Freeze-thaw cycles simultaneously decrease peatland photosynthetic carbon uptake and ecosystem respiration
T2  - BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Decreasing snow cover in winter resulting from climate warming increases the incidence of freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) in many ecosystems, including peatlands. As peatland ecosystems form a globally significant long-term carbon storage, understanding the effects of changing conditions in winter on carbon dynamics is essential. We studied how FTCs affect peatland carbon cycling by conducting mesocosm experiments with Sphagnum. Our results indicate an overall impeding effect of FTCs on Sphagnum photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, ecosystem respiration and enzymatic processes. A threefold reduction in photosynthesis in the FTC treatment was related to a decrease in chlorophyll content, showing that Sphagnum physiologically suffers from repeated FTCs. In the FTC treatment beta-glucosidase and phosphatase enzymatic activities decreased by 50% and 30%, respectively, whilst alanine remained unaffected, indicating that in peat soils short-term FTCs affect the carbon and phosphorus cycles, but not the nitrogen cycle. Long-term effects of FTCs deserve further studies.

TI  - Recent advances on the effects of microplastics on elements cycling in the environment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Microplastics (<5 mm) are an emerging pollutant which have received increasing concern in recent years. Microplastics pose a serious hazard and potential risk to the environment due to their migration, transformation, ad-sorption and degradation properties. The effects of different types of microplastics on the elemental cycles (carbon, ni-trogen and phosphorus cycles) in ecosystems were comprehensively summarized. The impacts of microplastics on the element cycle occur mainly in the soil environment and to less extent in other environments. Microplastics affect car-bon sources, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and carbon conversion processes, mainly by affecting plant and animal activities, changing gene abundance, enzyme activity, and microbial community composition. Microplastics can affect nitrogen sources, nitrogen fixation, ammonification, nitrification and denitrification processes by changing gene abun-dance, enzyme activity and microbial community composition. Microplastics can also influence phosphorus content and phosphorus conversion processes by stimulating enzyme activity and changing the composition of microbial com-munities. Future research needs to analyze the coupling of multiple microplastics and influencing factors on elemental cycling processes. This work provides a better view of the impacts of microplastics on element cycles and the interac-tion between microplastics and organisms.

TI  - Effect of salinity and soil aggregate size on microbial community involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsThere are one billion hectares of saline soil worldwide, which is a serious problem. Meanwhile, a gap remains in understanding the combined influence of soil salinity and aggregate size on microbial communities. The current study provided insight into the joint effects of soil salinity and aggregate size on the microbial function of saline soil, specifically in terms of carbon and nitrogen cycling.MethodsThe study was conducted in a rice field of Tiaozini Wetland (32 degrees 76.0'N, 120 degrees 96.3'E), located in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China. In this experiment, the low salinity and high salinity soils were divided into four size aggregates, respectively. The soil's physicochemical properties, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and 16S sequencing were determined.ResultsWe found that the MBC decreased as salinity increased, except in the 53-250 mu m aggregates. High salinity inhibited the predicted abundance of functional genes involved in microbial carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, chemolithotrophy, and nitrogen metabolism. Conversely, it significantly improved the predicted abundance of functional genes involved in nitrite ammonification.ConclusionsThe 250-2000 mu m soil aggregates under low salinity conditions had the most significant positive impact on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. The impact of salinity and aggregate size on predicted functional genes related to carbon cycling was greater than that on nitrogen cycling. Furthermore, under the combined effect of salinity and aggregate size, cyanobacteria emerged as the primary microbial community affecting the predicted functional genes involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Effects of different nitrogen applications and straw return depth on straw microbial and carbon and nitrogen cycles in paddy fields in the cool zone
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Straw is an important source of organic fertilizer for soil enrichment, however, the effects of different nitrogen(N) application rates and depths on straw decomposition microorganisms and carbon and nitrogen cycling under full straw return conditions in cool regions of Northeast China are not clear at this stage. In this paper, we applied macro-genome sequencing technology to investigate the effects of different N application rates (110 kg hm-2, 120 kg hm-2, 130 kg hm-2, 140 kg hm-2, 150 kg hm-2) and depths (0-15 cm, 15-30 cm) on straw decomposing microorganisms and N cycling in paddy fields in the cool zone of Northeast China. The results showed that (1) about 150 functional genes are involved in the carbon cycle process of degradation during the degradation of returned straw, of which the largest number of functional genes are involved in the methane production pathway, about 42, the highest abundance of functional genes involved in the citric acid cycle pathway. There are 22 kinds of functional genes involved in the nitrogen cycle degradation process, among which there are more kinds involved in nitrogen fixation, with 4 kinds. (2) High nitrogen application (150 kg hm-2) inhibited the carbon and nitrogen conversion processes, and the abundance of straw-degrading microorganisms and nitrogen-cycling functional genes was relatively high at a nitrogen application rate of 130 kg hm-2. (3) Depth-dependent heterogeneity of the microbial community was reduced throughout the vertical space. At 71 days of straw return, the nitrogen cycling function decreased and some carbon functional genes showed an increasing trend with the increase of straw return depth. The nitrogen cycle function decreased with the increase of straw returning depth. The microbial community structure was best and the abundance of functional genes involved in the nitrogen cycling process was higher under the conditions of 0-15 cm of returning depth and 130 kg hm-2 of nitrogen application.

TI  - Land cover types and depth regulate carbon and nitrogen cycle functional genes in permafrost regions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and AimsMicroorganisms are essential for carbon and nitrogen cycling in the active layer of permafrost regions, but the distribution and controlling factors of microbial functional genes across different land cover types and soil depths remain poorly understood. This gap hinders accurate predictions of carbon and nitrogen cycling dynamics under climate change. This study aims to explore how land cover type and soil depth influence microbial functional gene distribution in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's permafrost regions.MethodsSoil samples (0-50 cm) were collected from alpine wet meadows, alpine meadows, and alpine steppes. We analyzed the samples for physicochemical properties, microbial amplicon sequencing, and metagenomic sequencing. Correlation analyses were conducted between microbial community structure, functional genes, and environmental factors to identify the drivers of microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling.ResultsBacterial richness was 6.03% lower in steppe soils compared to wet meadow soils. Steppe soils exhibited the highest aerobic respiration potential, while deeper wet meadow soils had enhanced anaerobic carbon fixation potential and a higher abundance of carbon decomposition-related genes. Nitrogen assimilation was highest in steppe surface soils, whereas denitrification and ammonification were greatest in wet meadow soils. Carbon cycling potential was influenced by total soil carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and belowground biomass, while nitrogen cycling was driven by belowground biomass, soil moisture, and pH.ConclusionOur findings underscore the role of environmental factors in microbial functional gene distribution, providing new insights for modeling carbon and nitrogen cycling in alpine permafrost ecosystems under climate change.

TI  - Salinity affects microbial function genes related to nutrient cycling in arid regions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction Salinization damages soil system health and influences microbial communities structure and function. The response of microbial functions involved in the nutrient cycle to soil salinization is a valuable scientific question. However, our knowledge of the microbial metabolism functions in salinized soil and their response to salinity in arid desert environments is inadequate.Methods Here, we applied metagenomics technology to investigate the response of microbial carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) cycling and the key genes to salinity, and discuss the effects of edaphic variables on microbial functions.Results We found that carbon fixation dominated the carbon cycle. Nitrogen fixation, denitrification, assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA), and nitrogen degradation were commonly identified as the most abundant processes in the nitrogen cycle. Organic phosphorus dissolution and phosphorus absorption/transport were the most enriched P metabolic functions, while sulfur metabolism was dominated by assimilatory sulfate reduction (ASR), organic sulfur transformation, and linkages between inorganic and organic sulfur transformation. Increasing salinity inhibited carbon degradation, nitrogen fixation, nitrogen degradation, anammox, ANRA, phosphorus absorption and transport, and the majority of processes in sulfur metabolism. However, some of the metabolic pathway and key genes showed a positive response to salinization, such as carbon fixation (facA, pccA, korAB), denitrification (narG, nirK, norBC, nosZ), ANRA (nasA, nirA), and organic phosphorus dissolution processes (pstABCS, phnCD, ugpAB). High salinity reduced the network complexity in the soil communities. Even so, the saline microbial community presented highly cooperative interactions. The soil water content had significantly correlations with C metabolic genes. The SOC, N, and P contents were significantly correlated with C, N, P, and S network complexity and functional genes. AP, NH4+, and NO3- directly promote carbon fixation, denitrification, nitrogen degradation, organic P solubilization and mineralization, P uptake and transport, ASR, and organic sulfur transformation processes.Conclusion Soil salinity in arid region inhibited multiple metabolic functions, but prompted the function of carbon fixation, denitrification, ANRA, and organic phosphorus dissolution. Soil salinity was the most important factor driving microbial functions, and nutrient availability also played important roles in regulating nutrient cycling.

TI  - Functional insights into microbial community dynamics and resilience in mycorrhizal associated constructed wetlands under pesticide stress
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are critical mutualistic symbionts in most terrestrial ecosystems, where they facilitate nutrient acquisition, enhance plant resilience to environmental stressors, and shape the surrounding microbiome. However, its contributions (especially for microorganisms) to constructed wetlands (CWs) under pesticide stress remain poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of AMF on microbial community composition, diversity, metabolic pathways, and functional genes by metagenomics in CWs exposed to pesticides stress. Using comparative analyses of AMF-colonized and non-colonized CWs, we found that AMF enhanced overall microbial diversity, as evidenced by increases of 2.22 % (Chao1) and 2.83 % (observed species). Under fungicide stress, nitrogen-cycling microorganisms (e.g., Nitrososphaerota and Mucoromycota) increased in relative abundance, while carbon cycle-related microorganisms (e.g., Pseudomonadota and Bacteroidota) generally declined. AMF colonization improved microbial resilience, demonstrated by a 312 % rise in Rhizophagus abundance and significant increases in phosphorus-cycling microorganisms (e.g., Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium). Functional gene analysis further revealed that AMF helped mitigate fungicide-induced reductions in genes related to nitrogen and carbon cycling, lowering the average decline rates to 4.02 % and 1.44 %, respectively, compared to higher rates in non-AMF treatments. In summary, these findings highlight the crucial role of AMF in enhancing pesticide stress resilience, maintaining microbial community stability, and improving the bioremediation capacity of CWs.

TI  - Effects of livestock on nitrogen and carbon cycling in a savanna in Burkina Faso
T2  - ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - The nitrogen and carbon cycles are fundamental ecosystem processes influenced by several factors including soil type and other abiotic factors, plant species, grazing and soil organisms. Herbivores profoundly influence the functioning of ecosystems and the recycling of nutrients in interaction with plants in natural ecosystems. This study focuses on the effects of livestock on carbon and nitrogen cycling in a grazed savanna in Burkina Faso. Dominant grass species (aerial and root parts) and soil samples were collected under grasses and bare soil patches in 48 plots (24 protected and 24 unprotected plots), 18 months after setting up herbivores exclosures. Soil and grass C-13 and N-15 were used as integrative indicators of carbon and nitrogen cycles. The results revealed no significant effect of livestock on soil total carbon and nitrogen and on soil delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. Moreover, grazing had no significant effect on grass carbon and delta C-13, while it significantly increased grass total nitrogen and delta N-15. Therefore, our hypothesis that grazing would increase soil C-13 and N-15 values and plant biomass was only verified for grass N-15. Grass delta N-15 results suggest that grazing improves the immediate availability of nitrogen but could also increase nitrogen losses.

TI  - Effect of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes on the Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling Processes in Saline Soil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Soil salinization is a pressing issue that needs to be addressed in current agricultural production. In this study, we utilized novel materials, unfunctionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-OH), to explore the effects of soil carbon and nitrogen cycles in saline soil. We set up four treatments, which were exposed to two exposure doses of 1 g/kg and 1 mu g/kg and two MWCNT types of functionalized MWCNT-OH and unfunctionalized MWCNT. Our results demonstrate that exposure of saline soil to 1 g/kg functionalized MWCNT-OH significantly increased the soil inorganic nitrogen (p < 0.05), while also promoting the soil microbial biomass. This exposure can also potentially enhance greenhouse gas emissions from saline soil. Moreover, exposure to MWCNTs significantly increased the proportion of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, two dominant phyla (p < 0.05), which in turn improved their contribution to the carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within saline soil. High exposure dose treatments (1 g/kg) significantly increased the abundance of functional genes associated with carbon metabolism, carbon fixation, methane metabolism, and nitrogen cycling processes within saline soil. In contrast, low exposure dose treatments (1 mu g/kg) had no significant effect on the abundance of functional genes related to nitrogen cycling, but significantly increased the abundance of special functional genes related to carbon cycling. Redundancy analysis revealed that the microbial community composition within saline soil was significantly impacted by the soil total carbon, total nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen content. Furthermore, it was observed that over 80% of the carbon and nitrogen cycling processes within the saline soil were contributed by the dominant phyla. In summary, our research confirms the potential applicability of MWCNTs within saline soil. Notably, exposure of saline soil to 1 g/kg functionalized MWCNT-OH exhibited the most significant promoting effect on the carbon and nitrogen cycles.

TI  - The potential of viruses to influence the magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions in an inland wetland
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - Wetlands are among the earth's most efficient ecosystems for carbon sequestration, but can also emit potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) depending on how they are managed. Global management strategies have sought to maximize carbon drawdown by wetlands by manipulating wetland hydrology to inhibit bacterially-mediated emissions. However, it has recently been hypothesized within wetlands that viruses have the potential to dictate the magnitude and direction of GHG emissions by attacking prokaryotes involved in the carbon cycle. Here we tested this hypothesis in a whole-ecosystem manipulation by hydrologically-restoring a degraded wetland ('rewetting') and investigated the changes in GHG emissions, prokaryotes, viruses, and virus-host interactions. We found that hydrological restoration significantly increased prokaryotic diversity, methanogenic Methanomicrobia, as well as putative iron/sulfatecyclers (Geobacteraceae), nitrogen-cyclers (Nitrosomonadaceae), and fermentative bacteria (Koribacteraceae). These results provide insights into successional microbial community shifts during rehabilitation. Additionally, in response to watering, viral-induced prokaryotic mortality declined by 77%, resulting in limited carbon released by viral shunt that was significantly correlated with the 2.8-fold reduction in wetland carbon emissions. Our findings highlight, for the first time, the potential implications of viral infections in soil prokaryotes on wetland greenhouse gas dynamics and confirm the importance of wetland rehabilitation as a tool to offset carbon emissions.

TI  - Does the integration of the dynamic nitrogen cycle in a terrestrial biosphere model improve the long-term trend of the leaf area index?
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
AB  - The carbon cycle strongly interacts with the nitrogen cycle. Several observations show that the effects of global change on primary production and carbon storage in plant biomass and soils are partially controlled by N availability. Nevertheless, only a small number of terrestrial biosphere models represent explicitly the nitrogen cycle, despite its importance on the carbon cycle and on climate. These models are difficult to evaluate at large spatiotemporal scales because of the scarcity of data at the global scale over a long time period. In this study, we benchmark the capacity of the O-CN global terrestrial biosphere model to reproduce temporal changes in leaf area index (LAI) at the global scale observed by NOAA_AVHRR satellites over the period 1982-2002. Using a satellite LAI product based on the normalized difference vegetation index of global inventory monitoring and modelling studies dataset, we estimate the long-term trend of LAI and we compare it with the results from the terrestrial biosphere models, either with (O-CN) or without (O-C) a dynamic nitrogen cycle coupled to the carbon-water-energy cycles. In boreal and temperate regions, including a dynamic N cycle (O-CN) improved the fit between observed and modeled temporal changes in LAI. In contrast, in the tropics, simulated LAI from the model without the dynamic N cycle (O-C) better matched observed changes in LAI over time. Despite differential regional trends, the satellite estimate suggests an increase in the global average LAI during 1982-2002 by 0.0020 m(2) m(-2) y(-1). Both versions of the model substantially overestimated the rate of change in LAI over time (0.0065 m(2) m(-2) y(-1) for O-C and 0.0057 m(2) m(-2) y(-1) for O-CN), suggesting that some additional limitation mechanisms are missing in the model. We also estimated the relative importance of climate, CO2 and N deposition as potential drivers of the temporal changes in LAI. We found that recent climate change better explained temporal changes in LAI when the dynamic N cycle was included in the model (higher ranked fit for O-CN vs. O-C). Using the O-C configuration to estimate the direct effect of climate on LAI, we quantified the importance of climate-N cycle feedbacks in explaining the LAI response. We found that the warming-induced release of N from soil organic matter decomposition explains 17.5 % of the global trend in LAI over time, however, reaching up to 40.9 % explained variance in the boreal zone, which is a more important contribution than increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition. Our analysis supports a strong connection between warming, N cycling, and vegetation productivity. These findings underscore the importance of including N cycling in global-scale models of vegetation response to environmental change.

TI  - Reviewing the role of biochar in paddy soils: An agricultural and environmental perspective
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - The main challenge of the twenty-first century is to find a balance between environmental sustainability and crop productivity in a world with a rapidly growing population. Soil health is the backbone of a resilient environment and stable food production systems. In recent years, the use of biochar to bind nutrients, sorption of pollutants, and increase crop productivity has gained popularity. This article reviews key recent studies on the environmental impacts of biochar and the benefits of its unique physicochemical features in paddy soils. This review provides critical information on the role of biochar properties on environmental pollutants, carbon and nitrogen cycling, plant growth regulation, and microbial activities. Biochar improves the soil properties of paddy soils through increasing microbial activities and nutrient availability, accelerating carbon and nitrogen cycle, and reducing the availability of heavy metals and micropollutants. For example, a study showed that the application of a maximum of 40 t ha-1 of biochar from rice husks prior to cultivation (at high temperature and slow pyrolysis) increases nutrient utilization and rice grain yield by 40%. Biochar can be used to minimize the use of chemical fertilizers to ensure sustainable food production.

TI  - Functional microarray analysis of nitrogen and carbon cycling genes across an Antarctic latitudinal transect
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Soil-borne microbial communities were examined via a functional gene microarray approach across a southern polar latitudinal gradient to gain insight into the environmental factors steering soil Nand C-cycling in terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems. The abundance and diversity of functional gene families were studied for soil-borne microbial communities inhabiting a range of environments from 51 degrees S ( cool temperate - Falkland Islands) to 72 degrees S ( cold rock desert - Coal Nunatak). The recently designed functional gene array used contains 24 243 oligonucleotide probes and covers 410 000 genes in > 150 functional groups involved in nitrogen, carbon, sulfur and phosphorus cycling, metal reduction and resistance and organic contaminant degradation ( He et al. 2007). The detected N- and C-cycle genes were significantly different across different sampling locations and vegetation types. A number of significant trends were observed regarding the distribution of key gene families across the environments examined. For example, the relative detection of cellulose degradation genes was correlated with temperature, and microbial C-fixation genes were more present in plots principally lacking vegetation. With respect to the N- cycle, denitrification genes were linked to higher soil temperatures, and N-2-fixation genes were linked to plots mainly vegetated by lichens. These microarray-based results were confirmed for a number of gene families using specific real-time PCR, enzymatic assays and process rate measurements. The results presented demonstrate the utility of an integrated functional gene microarray approach in detecting shifts in functional community properties in environmental samples and provide insight into the forces driving important processes of terrestrial Antarctic nutrient cycling.

TI  - Effects of Bradyrhizobium Co-Inoculated with Bacillus and Paenibacillus on the Structure and Functional Genes of Soybean Rhizobacteria Community
T2  - GENES
AB  - Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are widely used to improve soil nutrients and promote plant growth and health. However, the growth-promoting effect of a single PGPR on plants is limited. Here, we evaluated the effect of applying rhizobium Bradyrhizobium japonicum 5038 (R5038) and two PGPR strains, Bacillus aryabhattai MB35-5 (BA) and Paenibacillus mucilaginosus 3016 (PM), alone or in different combinations on the soil properties and rhizosphere bacterial community composition of soybean (Glycine max). Additionally, metagenomic sequencing was performed to elucidate the profile of functional genes. Inoculation with compound microbial inoculant containing R5038 and BA (RB) significantly improved nodule nitrogenase activity and increased soil nitrogen content, and urease activity increased the abundance of the nitrogen cycle genes and Betaproteobacteria and Chitinophagia in the rhizosphere. In the treatment of inoculant-containing R5038 and PM (RP), significant changes were found for the abundance of Deltaproteobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes and the phosphorus cycle genes, and soil available phosphorus and phosphatase activity were increased. The RBP inoculants composed of three strains (R5038, BA and PM) significantly affected soybean biomass and the N and P contents of the rhizosphere. Compared with RB and RP, RBP consistently increased soybean nitrogen content, and dry weight. Overall, these results showed that several PGPR with different functions could be combined into composite bacterial inoculants, which coordinately modulate the rhizosphere microbial community structure and improve soybean growth.

TI  - Diversity and function of microbial communities in the sand sheath of Agropyron cristatum by metagenomic analysis
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The roots of most gramineous plants are surrounded by a variety of microorganisms; however, few studies have focused on the rhizosheath of psammophytes. Therefore, in this study, we used Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology to analyse the composition and functional diversity of microbial communities in the rhizosheath of sand-grown Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn. We found that the number of species and functions of microbial communities gradually decreased from the rhizosheath to the bulk soil. Thus, the microbial composition of the rhizosheath was richer and more diverse, and the abundance of bacteria, including Sphingosinicella, Rhizorhabdus, Friedmanniella, Geodermatophilus, Blastococcus, and Oscillatoria, was higher, and the abundance of fungi, such as Mycothermus, was higher. The abundance of CO2 fixation-related genes (acsA, Pcc, and cbbL) in the carbon cycle; NO3-, NO2-, NH2OH, and N-2 transformation genes (nrtP, nirS, Iwo, and nijK) in the nitrogen cycle; soxB/A/C, Sat, and dsrB genes in the sulphur cycle; and 1-phosphate mannitol dehydrogenase (MUD) gene and polyketide synthase gene (pks) were higher in the rhizosheath than in the bulk soil, as well as genes related to phosphorus uptake in the phosphorus cycle. Our findings showed that the rhizosheath may host the predominant microbial species related to the formation of a rhizosheath.

TI  - Metagenomics combined with metabolomics reveals the effect of Enterobacter sp. inoculation on the rhizosphere microenvironment of Bidens pilosa L. in heavy metal contaminated soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Metagenomics analysis was performed to determine the effects of Enterobacter sp. FM-1 (FM-1) on key genera as well as functional genes in the rhizosphere of Bidens pilosa L. (B. pilosa L.). Moreover, metabolomics was used to reveal the differences among rhizosphere metabolites after FM-1 inoculation. FM-1 inoculation significantly increased the activity of enzymes associated with the carbon cycle in soil; among them, invertase activity increased by 5.52 units compared to a control. Specifically, the relative abundance of beneficial genera increased significantly, such as Lysobacter (0.45-2.58 unit increase) in low-contamination soils (LC) and Pseudomonas (31.17-45.99 unit increase) in high-contamination soils (HC). Comparison of different transformation processes of the C cycle revealed that inoculation of FM-1 increased the abundance of functional genes related to the carbon cycle in LC soil. In contrast, the nitrogen cycling pathway was significantly elevated in both the LC and HC soils. FM-1 inoculation reduced HM resistance gene abundance in the rhizosphere soil of B. pilosa L. in the LC soil. Moreover, FM-1 and B. pilosa L. interactions promoted the secretion of rhizosphere metabolites, in which lipids and amino acids played important roles in the phytoremediation process. Overall, we explored the rhizosphere effects induced by plant-microbe interactions, providing new insights into the functional microbes and rhizosphere metabolites involved in phytoremediation.

TI  - Differences in Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling Strategies and Regional Variability in Biological Soil Crust Types
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
AB  - Biological soil crusts (BSCs) play a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem stability and soil fertility in arid and semi-arid regions. However, the biogeographical differences in soil functional composition between cyanobacterial BSCs (C-BSCs) and moss BSCs (M-BSCs), particularly how environmental changes affect nutrient cycling strategies and microbial community functions, remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated BSCs across aridity gradients (semi-humid, semi-arid, and arid regions) in China, focusing on carbon and nitrogen cycling pathways, enzyme activities, and nutrient acquisition strategies. It was found that aridity and BSC type had significant effects on the functional characteristics of microorganisms. This was demonstrated by significant differences in various soil microbial activities including enzyme activities and carbon and nitrogen nutrient cycling. With increasing aridity, C-BSCs exhibited reduced carbon cycling activity but enhanced nitrogen cycling processes, whereas M-BSCs displayed diminished activity in both carbon and nitrogen cycling. These divergent strategies were linked to soil properties such as pH and organic carbon content, with C-BSCs adapting through nitrogen-related processes (e.g., nifH, amoA) and M-BSCs relying on C fixation and degradation. These findings provide novel insights into the functional gene diversity of BSCs across different regions, offering valuable references for ecological restoration in arid areas. Specifically, our study highlights the potential of BSC inoculation for carbon and nitrogen enrichment in arid regions, with implications for climate-resilient restoration practices.

TI  - Long-term saline water irrigation affected soil carbon and nitrogen cycling functional profiles in the cotton field
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Saline water irrigation (SWI) plays an important role in alleviating water resource shortages. At the same time, the salt input of irrigation water affects soil microorganisms which participate in various ecological processes of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the responses of soil microbial functional potential to long-term SWI remains unclear. Therefore, Metagenomics method was utilized in cotton fields under long-term SWI to reveal the microbial functional profiles associated with soil carbon and nitrogen cycles. Results indicated that SWI impacted the microbial functional profiles of soil carbon and nitrogen cycles in the cotton fields significantly. Especially, irrigation water salinity inhibited the relative abundances of sacC and vanB, which are soil carbon degradation genes. SWI also affected the functional gene abundance of nitrogen degradation, dissimilatory nitrate reduction, and nitrification. Moreover, SWI significantly increased the abundance of Candidatus_Cloacimonetes in both carbon and nitrogen cycles. In the discussion, we used person analysis found that soil salinity, pH, and ammonium nitrogen were important factors affecting the abundance of functional genes and microbial taxa. Overall, this study indicated that long-term SWI significantly influenced specific microbial functional genes and taxa abundance, which may lead to predictable outcomes for soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and is of great importance in exploring the impact of SWI on soil environments.

TI  - Conversion of the coastal Atlantic forest to pasture: Consequences for the nitrogen cycle and soil greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - We evaluated how land use change affected the nitrogen cycle and greenhouse gas fluxes. We measured soil temperature and water-filled pore space (WFPS), as well as nitrate and ammonium concentrations, mineralization and nitrification rates, and flux of CH4, CO2 and N2O in soils of pasture catchment and in soils of a forest catchment located on the north coast of the State of Sao Paulo. The main vegetation type in the forest catchment is primary Atlantic Montane Forest, while the pasture is an unfertilized 40-year old area planted with Brachiaria humidicola. Four plots were used for monthly sampling in each land use for an entire year. Soil temperature was always higher in pasture than in forest soils, while WFPS was lower in the pasture in relation to forest soils. Pasture soils were a weak source of CH4 during the winter months and a less strong sink of methane than the forest soils during the rainy summer months of the year. The annual median CH4 uptake was -1.8 +/- 1.0 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the forest in contrast to -0.6 +/- 0.9 mg m(-2) d(-1) in pasture soils. CO2 emissions were similar in the winter, but higher in the summer months in pasture soils in relation to forest soils. The annual median flux in the forest was 4.2 +/- 1.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and increased in the pasture to 6.5 +/- 2.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In contrast. N2O fluxes were smaller in the pasture (0.3 +/- 0.7 ng cm(-2) h(-1)) than in forest soils (0.5 +/- 0.5 ng cm(-2) h(-1)). (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Macrohabitat and microhabitat mediate the relationships between wetland multifaceted biodiversity and multifunctionality
T2  - CATENA
AB  - The importance of plant and soil microbial diversity in sustaining ecological functions has attracted considerable attention. However, little is known about how these factors jointly affect the ability of an ecosystem to provide multiple ecological functions simultaneously (i.e., ecosystem multifunctionality [EMF]) in natural environments, especially in wetlands. Here, we collected rhizosphere soils, bulk soils, and sediments (microhabitats) from riverine, lacustrine, and palustrine wetland sites (macrohabitats) across the remote Tibetan Plateau. Plant diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional) and soil bacterial diversity (taxonomic and phylogenetic) were determined. We also calculated EMF using 20 variables related to soil carbon cycling, nitrogen cycling, and plant productivity. The results showed that EMF was significantly higher in rhizosphere soils than in bulk soils, but no significant differences were detected among the macrohabitat types. A significant relationship between EMF and bacterial diversity was detected only in rhizosphere soils, and a positive relationship between EMF and plant diversity was found in riverine and lacustrine wetlands. Environmental factors (climate and edaphic properties), bacterial diversity, and plant diversity together explained 63.48% of the EMF variation. Path modeling revealed that the effects of macrohabitat and microhabitat on EMF were mediated mainly through edaphic properties and bacterial diversity, respectively. These results significantly advance our understanding of the patterns and drivers of EMF in wetlands and are also critical for predicting changes in wetland functions in response to biodiversity loss and anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Agricultural films derived microplastics intensify acetochlor toxicity on soil health
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Herbicide acetochlor (ACT) is widely used in agricultural production, but it remains unclear whether microplastics (MPs) from agricultural films exacerbate its harmful effects on soil health. Here, a microcosm cultivation experiment was conducted to investigate the impacts of PE (Polyethylene)-MPs and PBAT (polybutylene adipate terephthalate)-MPs with ACT (MPs/ACT) on soil health. Results showed that MPs/ACT treatment caused soil acidification, depletion of organic carbon and ammonium, altered enzyme activities, and influenced greenhouse gas emissions compared to ACT alone. MPs/ACT co-exposure also restructured microbial communities, reducing alpha diversity, increasing co-occurrence network complexity, enriching putative contaminant degraders, and enhancing the relative abundance of key nitrogen-cycling genes, enzymes, and carbon-cycling genes. Notably, PBAT/ACT stimulated nitrification-denitrification processes more than PE/ACT, indicating polymer-specific effects on soil nutrient cycling. Overall, MPs/ACT decreased soil health by 8.89 % - 14.63 %, greater than 8.39 % caused by ACT alone. These results demonstrate that MPs exacerbate the toxic effects of ACT on soil health. Mitigation strategies, such as reducing MP inputs, optimizing herbicide use, and incorporating biochar or microbial amendments, may help to restore soil health and maintain ecosystem stability. This study provides critical insights into the compounded impacts of MPs and herbicides on soil ecosystems.

TI  - Linkages of plant traits to soil properties and the functioning of temperate grassland
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - P>1. Global change is likely to alter plant community structure, with consequences for the structure and functioning of the below-ground community and potential feedbacks to climate change. Understanding the mechanisms behind these plant-soil interactions and feedbacks to the Earth-system is therefore crucial. One approach to understanding such mechanisms is to use plant traits as predictors of functioning.
   2. We used a field-based monoculture experiment involving nine grassland species that had been growing on the same base soil for 7 years to test whether leaf, litter and root traits associated with different plant growth strategies can be linked to an extensive range of soil properties relevant to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Soil properties included the biomass and structure of the soil microbial community, soil nutrients, soil microclimate and soil process rates.
   3. Plant species with a high relative growth rate (RGR) were associated with high leaf and litter quality (e.g. low toughness, high nitrogen concentrations), an elevated biomass of bacteria relative to fungi in soil, high rates of soil nitrogen mineralization and concentrations of extractable inorganic nitrogen, and to some extent higher available phosphorus pools.
   4. In contrast to current theory, species with a high RGR and litter quality were associated with soils with a lower rate of soil respiration and slow decomposition rates. This indicates that predicting processes that influence carbon cycling from plant traits may be more complex than predicting processes that influence nitrogen and phosphorus cycling.
   5. Root traits did not show strong relationships to RGR, leaf or litter traits, but were strongly correlated with several soil properties, particularly the biomass of bacteria relative to fungi in soil and measures relating to soil carbon cycling.
   6. Synthesis. Our results indicate that plant species from a single habitat can result in significant divergence in soil properties and functioning when grown in monoculture, and that many of these changes are strongly and predictably linked to variation in plant traits associated with different growth strategies. Traits therefore have the potential to be a powerful tool for understanding the mechanisms behind plant-soil interactions and ecosystem functioning, and for predicting how changes in plant species composition associated with global change will feedback to the Earth-system.

TI  - Heating up the roof of the world: tracing the impacts of in-situ warming on carbon cycle in alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB  - Climate warming may induce substantial changes in the ecosystem carbon cycle, particularly for those climate-sensitive regions, such as alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. By synthesizing findings from in-situ warming experiments, this review elucidates the mechanisms underlying the impacts of experimental warming on carbon cycle dynamics within these ecosystems. Generally, alterations in vegetation structure and prolonged growing season favor strategies for enhanced ecosystem carbon sequestration under warming conditions. Whilst warming modifies soil microbial communities and their carbon-related functions, its effects on soil carbon release fall behind the increased vegetation carbon uptake. Despite the fact that no significant accumulation of soil carbon stock has been detected upon warming, notable changes in its fractions indicate potential shifts in carbon stability. Future studies should prioritize deep soil carbon dynamics, the interactions of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles under warming scenarios, and the underlying biological mechanisms behind these responses. Furthermore, the integration of long-term warming experiments with Earth system models is essential for reducing the uncertainties of model predictions regarding future carbon-climate feedback in these climate-sensitive ecosystems.

TI  - Summary of recent climate change studies on the carbon and nitrogen cycles in the terrestrial ecosystem and ocean in China
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
AB  - This article reviews recent advances over the past 4 years in the study of the carbon-nitrogen cycling and their relationship to climate change in China. The net carbon sink in the Chinese terrestrial ecosystem was 0.19-0.26 Pg C yr(-1) for the 1980s and 1990s. Both natural wetlands and the rice-paddy regions emitted 1.76 Tg and 6.62 Tg of CH4 per year for the periods 1995-2004 and 2005-2009, respectively. China emitted similar to 1.1 Tg N2O-N yr(-1) to the atmosphere in 2004. Land soil contained similar to 8.3 Pg N. The excess nitrogen stored in farmland of the Yangtze River basin reached 1.51 Tg N and 2.67 Tg N in 1980 and 1990, respectively. The outer Yangtze Estuary served as a moderate or significant sink of atmospheric CO2 except in autumn. Phytoplankton could take up carbon at a rate of 6.4x10(11) kg yr(-1) in the China Sea. The global ocean absorbed anthropogenic CO2 at the rates of 1.64 and 1.73 Pg C yr(-1) for two simulations in the 1990s. Land net ecosystem production in China would increase until the mid-21st century then would decrease gradually under future climate change scenarios. This research should be strengthened in the future, including collection of more observation data, measurement of the soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and sequestration, evaluation of changes in SOC in deep soil layers, and the impacts of grassland management, carbon-nitrogen coupled effects, and development and improvement of various component models and of the coupled carbon cycle-climate model.

TI  - Functional Gene Composition, Diversity and Redundancy in Microbial Stream Biofilm Communities
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - We surveyed the functional gene composition and diversity of microbial biofilm communities in 18 New Zealand streams affected by different types of catchment land use, using a comprehensive functional gene array, GeoChip 3.0. A total of 5,371 nutrient cycling and energy metabolism genes within 65 gene families were detected among all samples (342 to 2,666 genes per stream). Carbon cycling genes were most common, followed by nitrogen cycling genes, with smaller proportions of sulphur, phosphorus cycling and energy metabolism genes. Samples from urban and native forest streams had the most similar functional gene composition, while samples from exotic forest and rural streams exhibited the most variation. There were significant differences between nitrogen and sulphur cycling genes detected in native forest and urban samples compared to exotic forest and rural samples, attributed to contrasting proportions of nitrogen fixation, denitrification, and sulphur reduction genes. Most genes were detected only in one or a few samples, with only a small minority occurring in all samples. Nonetheless, 42 of 65 gene families occurred in every sample and overall proportions of gene families were similar among samples from contrasting streams. This suggests the existence of functional gene redundancy among different stream biofilm communities despite contrasting taxonomic composition.

TI  - Ecosystem Multifunctionality Regulated by Soil Microbial Activity and Indicator Taxa Versus Biodiversity for Industrial Solar Facilities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - The drive towards carbon neutrality has prompted the worldwide expansion of utility-scale solar facilities. Previous studies have reported the positive effects of solar facilities' installation on pasture productivity and biodiversity in arid regions. However, our understanding of how solar facilities influence a wide range of ecosystem functions simultaneously, and the relative contributions of soil microbial attributes, remains incomplete. To address this gap, we assessed the changes in ecosystem multifunctionality following solar facility installation in an alpine desert grassland in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau by measuring twenty-three ecosystem function indicators comprising primary production, the soil nutrient pool, carbon cycling, nitrogen cycling, phosphorus cycling and oxidation-reduction. Furthermore, we estimated the soil microbial diversity, microbial indicator taxa and microbial activity to identify the primary driving factors. The results showed that solar facilities had positive effects on ecosystem multifunctionality; the positive effect size was higher in the initial installation period (31.4%) than in the constant running period (3.5%). The enhancements in ecosystem multifunctionality were mainly due to enhanced nutrient cycling induced by the increased abundance of fungal indicator taxa and microbial activity. Moreover, the structural equation model revealed distinct regulatory paths between the two periods and a transition in the primary driving factors of ecosystem multifunctionality from microbial indicator taxa to microbial activity. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the positive influence of solar facilities on multiple ecosystem functions, emphasizing the critical role of soil microbial mechanisms in regulating ecosystem multifunctionality. These findings provide valuable insights into soil biota-driven processes that could inform strategies aimed at enhancing soil health and ecosystem functionality in arid grasslands under human-managed systems.

TI  - Fungal diversity drives soil multifunctionality after new tree species mixed into monoculture forest
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Forest ecosystems are crucial for maintaining global biogeochemical cycles and providing essential ecosystem services. Mixed plantation is increasingly recognized for their potential to enhance biodiversity and soil ecosystem functions compared to monoculture plantations. However, the effect of introducing new tree species into mature monoculture forests on soil multifunctionality remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the impact of mixing new tree species into the monoculture plantation on biodiversity, soil nutrient cycling, water regulation, and soil multifunctionality in the transitional climate zone of central China. This experiment comprised two forest types: a monoculture plantation of Quercus acutissima and a mixed forest incorporating Q. acutissima with Liquidambar formosana. Soil multifunctionality, nitrogen-cycling function, and phosphorus-cycling function significantly increased by 88.9 %, 195.7 %, and 133.2 % after introducing new tree species into the monoculture plantation. Compared to monoculture conditions, mixed plantation significantly decreased understory plant species richness, but increased soil feature index and soil fungal Chao1 index. Soil nitrogen-cycling and phosphorus-cycling functions were positively correlated with the soil fungal Chao1 index and the soil feature index (P < 0.05). Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that soil fungal diversity, rather than understory plant species richness, bacterial diversity, and soil feature index, directly and significantly positively affected soil multifunctionality, with an effect size of 0.824 (P < 0.01). Our findings highlight the potential benefits of incorporating new tree species into mature forest plantations to promote multiple soil functions. This study will provide a mechanistic understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions after mixing plantation in the subtropical-warm temperate climate transitional forests.

TI  - Soil microbial, nematode, and enzymatic responses to elevated CO2 N fertilization, warming, and reduced precipitation
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Ecological communities are increasingly confronted with multiple global change factors, which can have wide-ranging consequences for ecosystem structure and functions. Yet, we lack studies on the interacting effects of multiple global change factors on ecological communities - particularly long-term studies in field settings. Here, using a grassland field experiment in temperate North America, we report the interactive effects of four of the most common and pressing global change factors of the Anthropocene (elevated CO2, elevated nitrogen, warming, and summer drought) on soil microbial and free-living soil nematode communities, which together form an extensive share of terrestrial biodiversity. In addition, we measured microbial mass-specific soil enzyme activities related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles. Our results showed that mass-specific soil enzyme activities and their stoichiometry were strongly affected by higher-order interactions among the global change factors. In particular, the three-way interaction among elevated CO2, reduced precipitation, and warming decreased the ratio of carbon-to phosphorus-acquiring enzymes as well as nitrogen-to phosphorus-acquiring enzymes in the soil, indicating a relative increase in the breakdown of organic phosphorus in the soil. We also found that the three-way interaction among elevated CO2, reduced precipitation, and warming altered the predominant decomposition pathway in the soil (towards a bacterial-dominated energy channel in future environments), indicated by the Channel Index of nematode communities. Further, the three-way interaction among nitrogen fertilization, reduced precipitation, and warming enhanced acid phosphatase (related to the P cycle). Nematode density increased at elevated nitrogen and ambient CO2 as well as at ambient nitrogen and elevated CO2, whereas it did not differ from controls at elevated nitrogen and elevated CO2. Changes in microbial biomass were mainly driven by the additive effects of elevated CO2 and temperature. Our results reveal various ways in which global change factors affect (both additively and interactively) soil biotic responses mainly via altering nutrient demands of soil microorganisms and changing soil community structure and energy channels.

TI  - Rhizosphere element circling, multifunctionality, aboveground productivity and trade-offs are better predicted by rhizosphere rare taxa
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Microbes, especially abundant microbes in bulk soils, form multiple ecosystem functions, which is relatively well studied. However, the role of rhizosphere microbes, especially rhizosphere rare taxa vs. rhizosphere abundant taxa in regulating the element circling, multifunctionality, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and the trade-offs of multiple functions remains largely unknown. Here, we compared the multiple ecosystem functions, the structure and function of rhizosphere soil bacterial and fungal subcommunities (locally rare, locally abundant, regionally rare, regionally abundant, and entire), and the role of subcommunities in the Zea mays and Sophora davidii sole and Z. mays/S. davidii intercropping ecosystems in subtropical China. Results showed that intercropping altered multiple ecosystem functions individually and simultaneously. Intercropped Z. mays significantly decreased the trade-off intensity compared to sole Z. mays, the trade-off intensity under intercropped S. davidii was significantly higher than under intercropped Z. mays. The beta diversities of bacterial and fungal communities, and fungal functions in each subcommunity significantly differed among groups. Network analysis showed intercropping increased the complexity and positive links of rare bacteria in Z. mays rhizosphere, but decreased the complexity and positive links of rare bacteria in S. davidii rhizosphere and the complexity and positive links of fungi in both intercropped plants rhizosphere. Mantel test showed significant changes in species of locally rare bacteria were most strongly related to nitrogen-cycling multifunctionality, ANPP and trade-offs intensity, significant changes in species of locally rare fungus were most strongly related to carbon-cycling multifunctionality, phosphorus-cycling multifunctionality, and average ecosystem multifunctionality. This research highlights the potential and role of rare rhizosphere microorganisms in predicting and regulating system functions, productivity, and trade-offs.

TI  - Effect of Plastic Mulching on Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling-Related Bacterial Community Structure and Function in a Dryland Spring Maize Field
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Plastic mulching, given its positive effects on temperature and water retention, has been widely used to solve water shortages and nutrient scarcity in rainfed agricultural soils. This practice affects the physical and chemical processes of soil, including carbon and nitrogen cycling. However, research into microbe-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil with plastic mulching is still limited. In this study, the structures and functions of the soil bacterial community in non-mulched spring maize, plastic-mulched spring maize, and bareland fallow in a dryland field on the Loess Plateau in China were analyzed to explore the responses of microbe-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling to plastic mulching. Results showed that the richness of soil bacteria was the highest in bareland fallow. Plastic mulching increased the diversity and richness of soil bacteria to a certain extent (p > 0.05), and significantly increased the content of microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) (p < 0.05). Plastic mulching enhanced the total abundances of carbon and nitrogen cycling-related microbes, exhibiting a significant increase in the abundances of Cellvibrio, Bacillus, Methylobacterium and Nitrospira (p < 0.05). Predicted functional analysis revealed 299 metabolic pathways related to carbon and nitrogen cycling, including methane metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, and nitrogen metabolism. The number of gene families assigned to carbon and nitrogen cycling-related metabolic pathways was higher in plastic mulched than that in non-mulched spring maize. This study demonstrated that plastic mulching enhances the capacity of carbon and nitrogen cycling, revealing its potential in mediating greenhouse gas emissions in the dryland spring maize fields on the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Microbial diversity drives soil multifunctionality along reclamation chronosequence in an opencast coal mine
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Plantation reclamation can improve soil microbial diversity and soil multifunctionality in the reclaimed coal mine. However, with the reclamation years, how restoration of microbial communities promotes restoration of soil multifunctionality is not clear. Here, we investigated the microbial diversity and soil physicochemical properties and soil enzyme activities of different reclamation years in the reclaimed coal mine afforested with Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis). We chose six soil physicochemical properties (soil BD, pH, TC, TN, soil labile carbon [LC1], and [LC2]) pools and four soil enzyme activities (invertase, dehydrogenase, polyphenol oxidase, and urease) as soil multifunctionality indicators. Firstly, we compared the difference of soil microbial alpha diversity and soil physicochemical properties and soil enzyme activities of the different reclamation years and studied the changes of soil multifunctionality with the reclamation years. Secondly, the relationship between soil microbial diversity and soil multifunctionality was compared by fitting five different functions (logarithmic, linear, M-M, power, and exponential). Thirdly, we analyzed the driving effects of soil microbial diversity on soil multifunctionality at different threshold levels. Finally, the important driving factors on soil multifunctionality were explored. The results confirmed there were significant differences in soil microbial alpha diversity of different reclamation years, and the later stage was significantly higher than the initial stage of reclamation. Soil multifunctionality increased significantly with the reclamation years, and the soil multifunctionality related to carbon and nitrogen cycle increased more significantly. Microbial communities have strong driving effects on soil multifunctionality. Bacterial diversity was positively correlated with soil carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle function and soil multifunctionality in a nonredundant fashion. Random forest and structural equation modeling analyses showed that bacterial diversity was the most important biotic factor. Reclamation years had indirect effects on soil multifunctionality by affecting microbial communities. Soil microbial diversity had strong driving effects on soil multifunctionality. The results provided empirical evidence that the protection of biodiversity is crucial for maintaining ecosystem functions in reclaimed coal mine ecosystem.

TI  - Yeast Activities Involved in Carbon and Nitrogen Cycles in Antarctica
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ROLE OF MICRO-ORGANISMS IN THE ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Antarctica and sub-Antarctic regions are characterized by extreme conditions for life such as low temperatures and nutrient availability, high solar irradiation, and dryness; however, microorganisms from the three domains of life have been found as common inhabitants of soils and waters from those zones. Despite bacteria being the most numerous microorganisms in those habitats, a great diversity of psychrotrophic and psychrophilic yeasts have been also isolated and described. Yeasts, as chemoheterotrophic microorganisms, are involved in the recycling and mineralization of organic matter, playing an important role in carbon cycle. The range of organic substrates that they can degrade is wide. Their ability to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes involved in the breakdown of natural organic polymers has been well documented. Moreover, they can also use other substrates as n-alkanes or polyphenolic compounds as a sole carbon and energy source, so they could play a role in bioremediation in human-impacted areas. Most yeast obtain their energy by aerobic respiration; however, in anaerobic conditions, some of them carry out fermentation or anaerobic respiration. The use of nitrate or nitrite as the final electron acceptor provides nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas) as an end product. Thus, those yeasts can be considered as denitrifying microorganisms playing an important role in the nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Divergent Drivers of Various Topsoil Phosphorus Fractions Across Tibetan Alpine Grasslands
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - The storage and dynamics of various soil phosphorus (P) fractions could determine soil P availability, and thus regulate terrestrial carbon cycle and its feedback to climate warming. However, little evidence is available about patterns and drivers of soil P fractions in alpine ecosystems which could play a crucial role in terrestrial carbon cycle. Here we evaluated various topsoil P fractions and their determinants in Tibetan alpine grasslands using systematic measurements along a 3,000 km transect. Our results showed that topsoil P concentrations in Tibetan alpine grasslands were higher or equivalent than those in temperate and tropical-subtropical ecosystems. Our results also revealed distinct drivers among various soil P fractions: microbial properties and soil pH were dominant drivers of labile P and secondary mineral P fractions, respectively. Mineral properties were key determinants of occluded P and organic P fractions, whereas primary mineral P fraction was largely predicted by precipitation and mineral properties. The large-scale evidence obtained in this study offers new insights for better predicting the trajectory of soil P availability and its interactions with ecosystem carbon cycle in alpine ecosystems under changing environment.

TI  - Divergent rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil microbial structure and function in long-term warmed steppe due to altered root exudation
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - While there is an extensive body of research on the influence of climate warming on total soil microbial communities, our understanding of how rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil microorganisms respond to warming remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the impact of 4 years of soil warming on the diversity and composition of microbial communities in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil of a temperate steppe, focusing on changes in root exudation rates and exudate compositions. We used open top chambers to simulate warming conditions, resulting in an average soil temperature increase of 1.1 degrees C over a span of 4 years. Our results showed that, in the non-rhizosphere soil, warming had no significant impact on dissolved organic carbon concentrations, compositions, or the abundance of soil microbial functional genes related to carbon and nitrogen cycling. Moreover, soil microbial diversity and community composition remained largely unaffected, although warming resulted in increased complexity of soil bacteria and fungi in the non-rhizosphere soil. In contrast, warming resulted in a substantial decrease in root exudate carbon (by 19%) and nitrogen (by 12%) concentrations and induced changes in root exudate compositions, primarily characterized by a reduction in the abundance in alcohols, coenzymes and vitamins, and phenylpropanoids and polyketides. These changes in root exudation rates and exudate compositions resulted in significant shifts in rhizosphere soil microbial diversity and community composition, ultimately leading to a reduction in the complexity of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal community networks. Altered root exudation and rhizosphere microbial community composition therefore decreased the expression of functional genes related to soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. Interestingly, we found that changes in soil carbon-related genes were primarily driven by the fungal communities and their responses to warming, both in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil. The study of soil microbial structure and function in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil provides an ideal setting for understanding mechanisms for governing rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil carbon and nitrogen cycles. Our results highlight the distinctly varied responses of soil microorganisms in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil to climate warming. This suggests the need for models to address these processes individually, enabling more accurate predictions of the impacts of climate change on terrestrial carbon cycling.

TI  - Effects of Rhizophora mangle leaf litter and seedlings on carbon and nitrogen cycling in salt marshes - potential consequences of climate-induced mangrove migration
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aims Due to the production of large amounts of tannins and phenolics by Rhizophora mangle, it was hypothesized that the invasion of this mangrove species in salt marshes due to global warming will result in changes in the cycling of carbon and nitrogen.
   Methods Leaf litter and/or seedlings of R. mangle were placed into 1-m(2) experimental plots in a Distichlis spicata-dominated salt marsh on the Atlantic Coast of central Florida (USA). An additional litter decomposition experiment was conducted in all plots by adding litter bags containing 10 g of dried D. spicata shoot litter. Seedling growth was measured yearly. One and four years after the start of the experiment, soil samples were collected to determine physical and chemical soil conditions, potential nitrification and denitrification activities and abundances of genes that are related to microbial processes in the nitrogen cycle.
   Results Growth of R. mangle seedlings was stimulated in the presence of R. mangle litter, while decomposition rates of D. spicata litter were lower in plots with R. mangle litter and seedlings. The presence of R. mangle litter and/or seedlings had no significant effect on potential nitrification and denitrification activities and on the abundances of genes.
   Conclusions The colonization of R. mangle into D. spicata-dominated salt marshes will affect the carbon cycle, but not necessarily the nitrogen cycle, which is likely due to the pre-existing nitrogen-limited conditions in the salt marsh.

TI  - Application of spray-dried erythromycin fermentation residue as a soil amendment: antibiotic resistance genes, nitrogen cycling, and microbial community structure
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Erythromycin fermentation residue (EFR) after spray drying could be reused as a soil amendment. However, the effects of spray-dried EFR on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), nitrogen cycling, and microbial community structure in soil are rarely reported. In this study, a pot experiment was conducted by adding spray-dried EFR to soil. For the application of 1.0% spray-dried EFR, the residual erythromycin (ERY) could be rapidly removed with the half-life of 22.2 d; the total relative abundance of ARGs increased at first, but decreased to the initial level of the control group in the end; genes related to ammonium assimilation (glnA, gltB, gltD), ammonification (gdhA, gudB, cynT, cynS, ncd2), denitrification (narI, narG, narH), assimilatory nitrate reduction (nirA, nasA), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction (nirD) were enriched; soil microbial community structure presented temporary variation. Network analysis showed significant negative correlations between ARGs and nitrogen cycling genes. The addition of 6.0% spray-dried EFR resulted in the amplification of ARGs and inhibition of nitrogen cycling. This work provides new insights into the effects of spray-dried EFR on ARGs, nitrogen cycling, and microbial community structure within the fertilized soil.

TI  - Differential effects of fresh and composted organic wastes on soil bacterial community and maize growth
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The use of organic waste in agriculture improves soil health although its interaction with mineral fertilizers is not fully understood. This study investigated the impact of combining mineral fertilizers with organic wastes, such as sugarcane filter cake, poultry litter, and chicken manure in both fresh and composted forms, on maize (Zea mays) growth, soil bacterial communities, and their potential metabolic functions. The assessment was conducted 90 days post-application on two different soil types (i.e., clay and sandy clay loam) in a greenhouse setting. While fresh animal-derived organic wastes generally boost short-term plant growth and nutrient uptake, composted wastes can be more effective in reducing nitrogen losses and methane emissions over the long term. The impact of organic waste on soil microbial communities and functions varies, with fresh wastes increasing nitrification and methanogenesis, while composted wastes tend to stabilize carbon and reduce these processes. Evaluating different organic waste sources and forms, and considering their C:N ratios, is crucial for optimizing soil health and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. They also boosted plant growth and nutrient uptake, whereas composted waste increased soil mineral-associated organic matter (a more stable carbon pool) and phosphorus availability. These findings are crucial for optimizing the synergy between organic wastes and mineral fertilizers to enhance soil productivity and agricultural sustainability.

TI  - Effects of extreme drought on soil microbial functional genes involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling in alpine peatland
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Diverse microorganisms drive biogeochemical cycles and consequently influence ecosystem-level processes in alpine peatlands, which are vulnerable to extreme drought induced by climate change. However, there are few reports about the effects of extreme drought on microbial function. Here we identify microbial functional genes associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolisms of extreme drought experiments that occurred at different periods of plant growth, the results show that early extreme drought reduces the abundance of functional genes involved in the decomposition of starch and cellulose; midterm extreme drought increases the abundance of lignin decomposition functional genes; late extreme drought reduces the hemicellulose but increases cellulose decomposition functional genes. In the carbon fixation pathway, extreme drought mainly changes the abundance of functional genes involved in the reductive citrate cycle process, the 3-hydroxy propionate bi-cycle, the dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle and the incomplete reductive citrate cycle. Among the nitrogen cycling functional genes, amoA involved in oxidizing ammonia to hydroxylamine significantly increases under early extreme drought; midterm extreme drought reduces nrtC and nifD genes, which participate in nitrate assimilation and nitrogen fixation, respectively; late extreme drought significantly increases hcp genes involved in ammonification. pH and TN had the largest effects on the carbon degradation, fixation and nitrogen cycling functional genes. The composition of microbial community structures involved in carbon fixation differed between treatments in early extreme drought. There is a good linear fit between the diversity of gene abundance and corresponding microbial communities in the reductive citrate cycle, hydroxy propionate-hydroxybutyrate cycle, dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle and nitrogen cycling, which suggests that the functional genes and community composition of microorganisms involved in these processes are consistent in response to extreme drought. This study provides new insights into the adaptability and response characteristics of microbial communities and functional genes in plateau peatland ecosystems to extreme drought events.

TI  - Shrub encroachment alters microbial community composition and soil carbon and nitrogen cycling functional genes in northern peatlands
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Changes in vegetation, such as shrub encroachment in grassland and wetland ecosystems, significantly influence soil microbial communities and biogeochemical processes. However, the specific impact of shrub encroachment on peatland ecosystems remains poorly understood. This study used a "space-for-time" approach, collecting soil samples from three encroachment stages-uninvaded, shrub invasion, and shrub invasion expansion-at two depths (0-30 cm and 30-60 cm). Metagenomic sequencing was used to assess the microbial community composition and functional gene dynamics. Shrub encroachment significantly alters soil physicochemical properties, nutrient availability, and microbial communities. Alpha diversity of bacteria and fungi was influenced by shrub encroachment and depth, whereas beta diversity varied mainly with depth. Functional carbon fixation genes (korA and pps) increased during shrub encroachment, while methane oxidation (hdrA2) and carbon degradation genes (GH31 and GH51) decreased before increasing. In addition, functional genes linked to nitrogen cycling (nifD, nifH, amoA, and amoC) declined, indicating a reduction in nitrogen fixation and nitrification pathways. Correlation and Mantel tests revealed that the total soil carbon content was the primary driver of these functional changes. These findings highlight the dynamic microbial responses to shrub encroachment and offer insights into the soil carbon and nitrogen-cycling mechanisms in peatlands.IMPORTANCEShrub encroachment is transforming peatlands and altering their ecological and biogeochemical functions. This study provides critical insights into how shrub invasion affects microbial communities and functional genes responsible for carbon and nitrogen cycling in peatland soils. By revealing the underlying genetic mechanisms, this study enhances our understanding of the consequences of vegetation shifts on ecosystem processes. These findings are essential for predicting and managing peatland responses to environmental changes, helping to preserve their role as vital carbon and nutrient reservoirs.

TI  - Ecological safety evaluation of chlorpyrifos on agricultural soil: Effects on soil microbes
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The health of farmland soils is directly related to the proper application of pesticides. Chlorpyrifos is a widely used broad-spectrum organophosphorus insecticide, and its ecological security risk to farmland soils requires evaluation. A trial was conducted to study the effects of chlorpyrifos on soil microbes in a wheat-maize rotation field. A 45 % chlorpyrifos emulsion was sprayed at the recommended and dual doses, after which the chlorpyrifos residue, soil microbial content, bacterial community structure, functional microbial abundance, and enzyme activities were measured. The results showed that chlorpyrifos had a half-life of 8.94-9.88 and 2.17-2.18 days in soil for wheat and maize, respectively. Although the final chlorpyrifos residues in the crop grains were lower than the maximum residue limit recommended by the Chinese government, soil fungal abundance was significantly inhibited, and the structure and function of soil bacterial communities were disturbed. Furthermore, the quantities of nitrification-related genera (Acidobacteria GP4 and Acidobacteria GP6) and functional genes (AOB-amoA and AOA-amoA) decreased, whereas those of denitrification-related functional genes (nirS and nirK) and urease activity increased. Gemmatimonas and alkaline phosphatase involved in phosphorus cycling were activated, and the abundance of cbbLR and cbbLG genes involved in carbon fixation decreased. The integrated biomarker response index showed that nirK and beta-glucosidase were the most sensitive indicators in wheat and maize stages. The present study provides toxicological data and theoretical guidance for the ecological safety evaluation and rational application of chlorpyrifos in soil.

TI  - Effects of chicken manure-derived black soldier fly organic fertilizer on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling: insights from metagenomic and microbial network analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Black soldier fly (BSF) organic fertilizer is known to enhance soil fertility and promote plant growth. However, its effects on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling remains unclear. In this study, we established a BSF chicken manure bioconversion system to produce BSF organic fertilizer and investigate its impacts on soil C and N cycling, as well as microbial ecological networks through metagenomic analysis. Compared to the control, BSF organic fertilizer significantly increased soil organic matter by 16.1 % (p < 0.05) and total potassium by 11.0 % (p < 0.05). Metagenomic sequencing revealed that BSF organic fertilizer significantly enhanced soil C and N cycling. For instance, the abundance of carbon fixation genes such as Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle genes pyc, pycA, and pycB increased by 35.7 % (p < 0.01), 107.1 % (p < 0.001), and 14.6 % (p < 0.05), respectively. In nitrogen cycling, denitrification genes nirB, nirK, and nirS increased by 181.5 % (p < 0.001), 102.7 % (p < 0.001), and 25.9 % (p < 0.05), respectively. Furthermore, soils amended with BSF organic fertilizer displayed a 9.9 % higher proportion of positive microbial interactions, particularly enhancing synergistic associations between bacteria and fungi, suggesting improved microbial community stability. Importantly, bacteria and fungi were interdependent in regulating C and N cycling processes, together orchestrating soil ecosystem functions. Overall, BSF organic fertilizers effectively promoted soil C and N cycling and maintained the stability of microbial communities. These findings provide valuable insights for the rational selection of fertilizers and the optimization of fertilization management practices, thereby contributing to the sustainable development of agricultural production.

TI  - Ecotoxicological effects of microplastic types and concentrations in combination with Cd on the bioenergy plant sweet sorghum: Growth and rhizosphere microbiome analysis
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - Complex interactions occur when microplastics (MPs) and heavy metals cooccur as pollutants, and these interactions have become a popular research topic. However, there is a lack of research examining the impact of concurrent pollution from MPs and heavy metals on the soil microbial community and its roles in nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of composite pollution from cadmium (Cd) and different types of MPs (e.g., PVC, PE, and PP) at different concentrations (0.1 % and 0.5 %) on the growth of sweet sorghum, an energy plant, and evaluated Cd accumulation in sweet sorghum and the expression of genes related to soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. The results indicated that the growth of sweet sorghum was negatively impacted by combined treatment with the three types of microplastics and Cd, with the composite stress trend being 0.5%> 0.1 %. The contents of mineral nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil decreased due to MP+Cd pollution. Cocontamination with MP and Cd significantly affected the microbial community composition and increased the activity of enzymes such as urease. MP+Cd pollution affected the composition and abundance of functional genes related to nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. The type and concentration of microplastics were identified as the primary factors influencing the composition and abundance of functional genes. Bacteria belonging to Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria are key to soil nitrogen cycling, while Acidobacteria plays crucial roles in soil phosphorus cycling. Metagenomic analysis was performed in this study to determine the impact of microplastic-heavy metal pollution on soil microbial communities and functions and to provide a reference for the environmental assessment of soils contaminated by both microplastics and heavy metals.

TI  - Polyethylene microplastics alter soil microbial community assembly and ecosystem multifunctionality
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Although pervasive microplastics (MPs) pollution in terrestrial ecosystems invites increasing global concern, impact of MPs on soil microbial community assembly and ecosystem multifunctionality received relatively little attention. Here, we manipulated a mesocosm experiment to investigate how polyethylene MPs (PE MPs; 0, 1%, and 5%, w/w) influence ecosystem functions including plant production, soil quality, microbial community diversity and assembly, enzyme activities in carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling, and multifunctionality in the maize-soil continuum. Results showed that PE MPs exerted negligible effect on plant biomass (dry weight). The treatment of 5% PE MPs caused declines in the availability of soil water, C and P, whereas enhanced soil pH and C storage. The activity of C -cycling enzymes (alpha/beta-1, 4-glucosidase and beta-D-cellobiohydrolase) was promoted by 1% PE MPs, while that of beta-1, 4-glucosidase was inhibited by 5% PE MPs. The 5% PE MPs reduced the activity of N -cycling enzymes (protease and urease), whereas increased that of the P -cycling enzyme (alkaline phosphatase). The 5% PE MPs shifted soil microbial community composition, and increased the number of specialist species, microbial community stability and networks resistance. Moreover, PE MPs altered microbial community assembly, with 5% treatment decreasing dispersal limitation proportion (from 13.66% to 9.96%). Overall, ecosystem multifunctionality was improved by 1% concentration, while reduced by 5% concentration of PE MPs. The activity of alpha/beta-1, 4-glucosidase, urease and protease, and ammonium -N content were the most important predictors of ecosystem multifunctionality. These results underscore that PE MPs can alter soil microbial community assembly and ecosystem multifunctionality, and thus development and implementation of practicable solutions to control soil MPs pollution become increasingly imperative in sustainable agricultural production.

TI  - Plant functional group effects on peat carbon cycling in a boreal rich fen
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Dominant plant functional groups (PFGs) found in boreal rich fens include sedges, grasses, horsetails, and cinquefoils (obligate wetland shrubs). Precipitation regime shift and permafrost thaw due to climate change will likely trigger changes in fen plant community structure through shifts in these PFGs, and it is thus crucial to understand how these PFGs will impact carbon cycling and greenhouse gas dynamics to predict and model peatland-climate feedbacks. In this study, we detail the above and belowground effects of these PFGs on aspects of carbon cycling using a mesocosm approach. We hypothesized that PFGs capable of aerating the rhizosphere (sedges, horsetails, and grasses) would oxidize the belowground environment supporting higher redox potentials, a favorable environment for decomposition, and higher CO2:CH4 in pore water and gas efflux measurements than PFGs lacking aerenchyma (cinquefoil, unplanted control). Overall, sedges, horsetail and grasses had an oxidizing effect on rhizosphere pore water chemistry, producing an environment more favorable for methanotrophy during the growing season, as supported by an approximate isotopic enrichment of pore water methane (delta(CH4)-C-13) by 5 parts per thousand, and isotopic depletion in pore water carbon dioxide (delta(CO2)-C-13) by 10 parts per thousand, relative to cinquefoil treatments. Cinquefoil and unplanted control treatments fostered a reducing environment more favorable for methanogenesis. In addition, cinquefoil appeared to slow decomposition in comparison with the other PFGs. These findings, paired with PFG effects on oxidation-reduction potential and CO2 and CH4 production, point to the ability of rich fen plant communities to moderate biogeochemistry, specifically carbon cycling, in response to changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Nutrient addition effects on tropical dry forests: a mini-review from microbial to ecosystem scales
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
AB  - Humans have more than doubled inputs of reactive nitrogen globally and greatly accelerated the biogeochemical cycles of phosphorus and metals. However, the impacts of increased element mobility on tropical ecosystems remain poorly quantified, particularly for the vast tropical dry forest biome. Tropical dry forests are characterized by marked seasonality, relatively little precipitation, and high heterogeneity in plant functional diversity and soil chemistry. For these reasons, increased nutrient deposition may affect tropical dry forests differently than wet tropical or temperate forests. Here, we review studies that investigated how nutrient availability affects ecosystem and community processes from the microsite to ecosystem scales in tropical dry forests. The effects of N and P addition on ecosystem carbon cycling and plant and microbial dynamics depend on forest successional stage, soil parent material, and rainfall regime. Responses may depend on whether overall productivity is N- vs. P-limited, although data to test this hypothesis are limited. These results highlight the many important gaps in our understanding of tropical dry forest responses to global change. Large-scale experiments are required to resolve these uncertainties.

TI  - Key ecological responses to nitrogen are altered by climate change
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition are both important ecological threats. Evaluating their cumulative effects provides a more holistic view of ecosystem vulnerability to human activities, which would better inform policy decisions aimed to protect the sustainability of ecosystems. Our knowledge of the cumulative effects of these stressors is growing, but we lack an integrated understanding. In this Review, we describe how climate change alters key processes in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems related to nitrogen cycling and availability, and the response of ecosystems to nitrogen addition in terms of carbon cycling, acidification and biodiversity.

TI  - Nitrogen cycling: A review of the processes, transformations and fluxes in coastal ecosystems
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
AB  - The coastal and marine nitrogen cycle occupies a complex, central role within the biogeochemical cycles. Human interventions in the earth system have risen to unprecedented levels, strongly influencing the global nitrogen cycle. The nitrogen cycle in the open ocean compared to coastal ecosystems appears to have remained unharmed, although recent observations have shown increasing anthropogenic influence. Projections suggest that global nitrogen cycle is being altered either directly by the continued addition of anthropogenically created fixed nitrogen to the earth system. and its cascading effects, or indirectly through anthropogenically induced climate change. These alterations have the potential to cause positive feedbacks in the climate system, but they are neither well understood nor quantified. In the atmosphere, concentrations of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide and of the nitrogen-precursors of smog and acid rain are increasing. This unprecedented nitrogen loading has contributed to long-term decline in coastal fisheries. This article reviews some of the major processes, transformations and fluxes of nitrogen in the coastal ecosystems with reference to mangroves, occurring naturally and also due to human perturbations.

TI  - Nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (N-DAMO) in global aquatic environments: A review
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The vast majority of processes in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are driven by microorganisms. The nitritedependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (N-DAMO) process links carbon and nitrogen cycles, offering a novel approach for the simultaneous reduction of methane emissions and nitrite pollution. However, there is currently no comprehensive summary of the current status of the N-DAMO process in natural aquatic environments. Therefore, our study aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a comprehensive review of the global research trends in N-DAMO processes in various aquatic environments (excluding artificial bioreactors). Our review mainly focused on molecular identification, global study sites, and their interactions with other elemental cycling processes. Furthermore, we performed a data integration analysis to unveil the effects of key environmental factors on the abundance of N-DAMO bacteria and the rate of N-DAMO process. By combining the findings from the literature review and data integration analysis, we proposed future research perspectives on N-DAMO processes in global aquatic environments. Our overarching goal is to advance the understanding of the NDAMO process and its role in synergistically reducing carbon emissions and removing nitrogen. By doing so, we aim to make a significant contribution to the timely achievement of China's carbon peak and carbon neutrality targets.

TI  - Microbiotic crusts and ecosystem processes
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES
AB  - Microbiotic crusts are biological soil crusts composed of lichens, cyanobacteria, algae, mosses, and fungi. The biodiversity of these crusts is poorly understood; several cosmopolitan species dominate in most areas, but many species are confined to one or a few sites. Nitrogen fixation by organisms within the crust can be the dominant source of nitrogen input into many ecosystems, although rates of nitrogen input are limited by water availability, temperature, and nitrogen loss from the crust. Photosynthetic rates of the microbiotic crust can be 50% of those observed for higher plants, but the contribution of crusts to carbon cycling is not known. The microbiotic crust binds soil particles together, and this significantly increases soil surface stability and resistance to erosion. Greenhouse studies have found that crusts can enhance seed germination, seedling survivorship, and plant nutrient status, but further experiments are needed under field conditions. Crusts are extremely susceptible to surface disturbance and fire, and disruption of crusts can decrease soil fertility and stability resulting in lower nutrient availability for vascular plants and significant soil loss from the ecosystem.

TI  - Effects of organic fertilizers on plant growth and the rhizosphere microbiome
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Application of organic fertilizers is an important strategy for sustainable agriculture. The biological source of organic fertilizers determines their specific functional characteristics, but few studies have systematically examined these functions or assessed their health risk to soil ecology. To fill this gap, we analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data from 637 soil samples amended with plant- and animal-derived organic fertilizers (hereafter plant fertilizers and animal fertilizers). Results showed that animal fertilizers increased the diversity of soil microbiome, while plant fertilizers maintained the stability of soil microbial community. Microcosm experiments verified that plant fertilizers were beneficial to plant root development and increased carbon cycle pathways, while animal fertilizers enriched nitrogen cycle pathways. Compared with animal fertilizers, plant fertilizers harbored a lower abundance of risk factors such as antibiotic resistance genes and viruses. Consequently, plant fertilizers might be more suitable for long-term application in agriculture. This work provides a guide for organic fertilizer selection from the perspective of soil microecology and promotes sustainable development of organic agriculture.IMPORTANCEThis study provides valuable guidance for use of organic fertilizers in agricultural production from the perspective of the microbiome and ecological risk.

TI  - Plant diversity is more important than soil microbial diversity in explaining soil multifunctionality in Qinghai-Tibetan plateau wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau harbors rich and diverse wetlands that provide multiple ecological functions simultaneously. Although the relationships between biodiversity and wetland functioning have been well studied in recent decades, the links between the multiple features of plant and microbial communities and soil multifunctionality (SMF) remain unknown in the high-altitude wetlands that are extremely sensitive to human disturbance. Here, using the single function, averaging, weighted, and multiple-threshold methods, we calculated the SMF of Qinghai-Tibetan wetlands based on 15 variables associated with soil nutrient status, nutrient cycle, and greenhouse gas emission. We then related SMF to multidimensional (species, phylogenetic, and functional) diversity of plants and soil microorganisms and microbial network modules. The results showed that plant diversity explained more variance in SMF than soil microbial diversity, and plant species richness and phylogenetic distance were positive predictors of SMF. Bacterial network modules were more positively related to SMF than fungal network modules, and the alpha diversity of bacterial network modules contributed more to SMF than the diversity of the whole bacterial community. Pediococcus, Hirsutella, and Rhodotorula were biomarkers for SMF and had significant relationships with nitrogen mineralization and greenhouse gas emissions. Together, these results highlight the importance of plant diversity and bacterial network modules in determining the SMF, which are crucial to predicting the response of ecosystem functioning to biodiversity loss under intensifying anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Effect of grazing on soil enzyme activities in grassland ecosystems: A meta-analysis
T2  - GRASSLAND SCIENCE
AB  - Grazing causes major disturbances to grassland ecosystems and may alter soil enzyme activity. However, the mechanism by which grazing intensity, livestock type, grazing duration and environmental (e.g., climate and soil) factors affect the response of soil enzymes to grazing is currently unknown. This meta-analysis investigated the response of soil enzymes to grazing and the underlying intrinsic mechanisms based on 443 observations collected from 38 studies. Overall, grazing had a negative effect on soil enzyme activity, especially the activities of beta-glucosidase, sucrase, urease and alkaline phosphatase. Activity in response to grazing varied depending on the grazing intensity, grazing animals and grazing duration. Negative effects increased with increasing grazing intensity, as both moderate and heavy grazing significantly reduced activity by 10.08% and 20.06%, respectively. All levels of grazing intensity significantly reduced carbon-cycle-related sucrase but there were no significant effects on N-acetyl-beta-D glucosaminidase or leucine aminopeptidase, two enzymes involved in the nitrogen cycle. Among grazing animals, sheep, cattle and mixed grazing all significantly reduced activity, with the exception of the positive effects of cattle grazing on the activities of beta-glucosidase and protease, both of which participate in the carbon cycle, and N-acetyl-beta-D glucosaminidase, involved in the nitrogen cycle. However, while short-term (<5 years) and medium-term (5-10 years) grazing significantly reduced activity, the negative effects were ameliorated as the number of grazing years increased, such that long-term grazing (>10 years) had no significant effects. The interactions between climate, soil and other factors and grazing in terms of the impact on soil enzyme activity varied. Because soil enzymes mediate nutrient cycling, maintaining soil health requires that decision-makers appropriately reduce grazing intensity while increasing grazing duration.

TI  - Metagenomic Profiling of a Microbial Assemblage Associated with the California Mussel: A Node in Networks of Carbon and Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Mussels are conspicuous and often abundant members of rocky shores and may constitute an important site for the nitrogen cycle due to their feeding and excretion activities. We used shotgun metagenomics of the microbial community associated with the surface of mussels (Mytilus californianus) on Tatoosh Island in Washington state to test whether there is a nitrogen-based microbial assemblage associated with mussels. Analyses of both tidepool mussels and those on emergent benches revealed a diverse community of Bacteria and Archaea with approximately 31 million bp from 6 mussels in each habitat. Using MG-RAST, between 22.5-25.6% were identifiable using the SEED non-redundant database for proteins. Of those fragments that were identifiable through MG-RAST, the composition was dominated by Cyanobacteria and Alpha and Gamma-proteobacteria. Microbial composition was highly similar between the tidepool and emergent bench mussels, suggesting similar functions across these different microhabitats. One percent of the proteins identified in each sample were related to nitrogen cycling. When normalized to protein discovery rate, the high diversity and abundance of enzymes related to the nitrogen cycle in mussel-associated microbes is as great or greater than that described for other marine metagenomes. In some instances, the nitrogen-utilizing profile of this assemblage was more concordant with soil metagenomes in the Midwestern U. S. than for open ocean system. Carbon fixation and Calvin cycle enzymes further represented 0.65 and 1.26% of all proteins and their abundance was comparable to a number of open ocean marine metagenomes. In sum, the diversity and abundance of nitrogen and carbon cycle related enzymes in the microbes occupying the shells of Mytilus californianus suggest these mussels provide a node for microbial populations and thus biogeochemical processes.

TI  - Macrogenomics reveal the effects of inter-cropping perilla on kiwifruit: impact on inter-root soil microbiota and gene expression of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles in kiwifruit
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Intercropping systems can improve soil fertility and health, however, soil microbial communities and functional genes related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling under the intercropping system of mesquite and perilla have not been studied. Therefore, in the present study, different planting densities and varieties of Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt and kiwifruit were used for intercropping, and changes in soil microbial communities and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling genes in kiwifruit inter-roots under inter-cropping conditions were investigated by macro-genome sequencing technology. The results showed that intercropping with Perill caused a decrease in most soil nutrients, soil enzyme activities, and had a significant impact on the microbial (bacteria and fungi) diversity. Inter-cropping increased the relative abundance of the dominant bacterial phylum "Proteobacteria" and "Actinobacteria" by 47 and 57%, respectively, but decreased the relative abundance of the dominant fungal phylum "Chordata" and "Streptophyta" by 11 and 20%, respectively, in the inter-root soil of kiwifruit, and had a significant impact on the microbial (bacteria and fungi) diversity. In addition, inter-cropping could greatly increase the inter-root soil carbon sequestration (PccA, korA/B/C/D, fhs, and rbcl/s), carbon degradation (abfD), organic nitrogen mineralization (GDH2), denitrification (napA/B, nirB, norB), organic phosphorus mineralization (phop, phn), and inorganic phosphorus solubilization (gcd, ppk) gene abundance. The gene co-occurrence network indicated that soil korB, nirB, and gnd key functional genes for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling in kiwifruit inter-root soils and their expression was up-regulated in the inter-cropping group. Structural equation (SEM) further showed that soil total nitrogen, organic matter, total carbon and acid phosphatase had significant effects on microbial diversity (p < 0.05) and soil carbon cycling gene korB and phosphorus cycling gene purH (p < 0.001), while korB and purH had positive effects on kiwifruit quality. In conclusion, intercropping perilla in kiwifruit orchards changed the structure of bacterial and fungal communities in the inter-root soil of kiwifruit, but I believe that intercropping perilla stimulates carbon degradation, leading to carbon emission and serious loss of soil nutrients, and that prolonged intercropping may adversely affect the quality of kiwifruit, and thus its limitations should be noted in future studies.

TI  - Soil pathogenic fungal groups and soil nutrient cycling under land use practices in Liupanshan Mountain in China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Different land-use practices in temperate forests strongly affect soil quality and soil microbial communities, whereas the assembly and interactions of soil functional fungal communities provide positive feedback. Therefore, the effects of forest ecosystem degradation on the composition of functional soil fungal community and soil nutrient cycling are of particular importance. We studied forest ecosystems in the Liupanshan Mountains in the northwestern part of the Loess Plateau and analyzed the relationship of soil fungal community and soil nutrient cycling under different land use practices (natural forest [NF], plantation forest, and farmland [FL]). The results showed that soil pH and electrical conductivity were the highest in FL, whereas the soil carbon cycle index and nitrogen cycle index decreased. The soil total phosphorus content did not change significantly with an increase in available phosphorus content. The change from NF to FL significantly increased the number of operational taxonomic units, diversity, and richness of soil fungal communities. The composition of the soil fungal communities was also strongly influenced by carbon and nitrogen cycle indices. In addition, FL reclamation increased the complexity of the soil microorganism co-occurrence network, and the interrelationships between soil functional fungal community were enhanced. Pathogenic fungal communities were enriched in FLs, and their relative abundance was significantly regulated by environmental factors such as pH and the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus. The soil pathogenic fungal community affected carbon and nitrogen cycle indices to varying degrees.

TI  - Insights into the shift of microbial community related to nitrogen cycle, especially N2O in vanadium-polluted soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Soil is a vital contributor to the production of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, through the nitrogen cycle, which can be influenced by accumulated vanadium (V) in soil but it is less pronounced. This work investigated the response of soil N2O fluxes along with major nitrogen cycle products (ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite) to different vanadium contents (0, 200, 500, 800, and 1100 mg V/kg), and the underlying microbial mechanisms. N2O fluxes was significantly influenced at high V content (1100 mg V/kg) due to its corresponding high water-soluble V content. Microbial composition and their correlations with nitrogen cycle products showed that microbes in dominant phyla (Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria) and genus (Nocardioides, Lysobacter, Sphingomonas, and Marmoricola) might be the important contributor to N2O fluxes regardless of the V content. Moreover, high V contents (800, and 1100 mg V/kg) could enrich microbes involved in nitrogen cycle, but weaken their correlations with nitrogen-related products, such as in genus Bacillus, and change microbial cor-relation with N2O from associated with nitrate and nitrite to ammonium. Meanwhile, functional gene predication results showed that denitrifying genes nirKS and nosZ were negatively and positively correlated with V contents, respectively. These all further suggested that the shift of possible N2O metabolic pathways induced mainly by water-soluble V might be the underlying reason for N2O fluxes. These findings promote an understanding of the potential effect of metal pollution on N2O fluxes in soil.

TI  - Greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions after abandonment of agriculture
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB  - The GHG (CO2, CH4, N2O) emission potential along a chronosequence of former agricultural soils abandoned for 9 to 32 years were compared to an actively managed (on-going) agricultural soil (reference). The soils were incubated in mesocosms with and without manure amendment, and microbial functional groups involved in nitrous oxide emission were quantitatively assessed. Carbon dioxide emission significantly increased after agriculture abandonment (< 24 years) consistent with higher decomposition rate, but total emission decreased in the long term (> 29 years). With the cessation of agriculture, the abandoned sites generally became a net methane sink. Notably, total nitrous oxide emission showed a significant monotonic decrease over years of abandonment in response to manure amendment, possibly reflecting an altered capacity for (de)nitrification as indicated in the response of the (de)nitrifier abundance. Overall, our findings suggest that the GHG legacy of agriculture diminishes over time (> 29 years), with lowered GHG emissions and global warming potential (GWP) after abandonment of agriculture.

TI  - Ecological Lessons from Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) Experiments
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS, VOL 42
AB  - Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments have provided novel insights into the ecological mechanisms controlling the cycling and storage of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and contribute to our ability to project how ecosystems respond to increasing CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere. Important lessons emerge by evaluating a set of hypotheses that initially guided the design and longevity of forested FACE experiments. Net primary productivity is increased by elevated CO2, but the response can diminish over time. Carbon accumulation is driven by the distribution of carbon among plant and soil components with differing turnover rates and by interactions between the carbon and nitrogen cycles. Plant community structure may change, but elevated CO2 has only minor effects on microbial community structure. FACE results provide a strong foundation for next-generation experiments in unexplored ecosystems and inform coupled climate-biogeochemical models of the ecological mechanisms controlling ecosystem response to the rising atmospheric CO2 concentration.

TI  - Resistance and Resilience of Soil Nitrogen Cycling to Drought and Heat Stress in Rehabilitated Urban Soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - In the context of climate change and biodiversity loss, rehabilitation of degraded urban soils is a means of limiting artificialization of terrestrial ecosystems and preventing further degradation of soils. Ecological rehabilitation approaches are available to reinitiate soil functions and enhance plant development. However, little is known about the long-term stability of rehabilitated soils in terms of soil functions when further natural or anthropogenic perturbations occur. Based on rehabilitated urban soils, the present study sought to evaluate the resistance and resilience of soil functions linked to carbon cycling and phosphate dynamics in addition to nitrogen cycling and related microbial communities after a heat and drought stress. A laboratory experiment was conducted in microcosms under controlled temperature conditions, with four contrasted soils collected from a rehabilitated urban brownfield; an initial, non-rehabilitated soil (IS), a technosol with a high organic matter level (HO), and two technosols with less organic matter (LO1 and LO2), together with their respective controls (no stress). Changes in potential denitrification (PDR), nitrification (PNR) rates, and their interactive relationships with soil microbial activities and soil physicochemical properties were determined following a combined heat (40 degrees C) and drought stress period of 21 days. Measurements were carried out immediately after the stress (resistance), and then also 5, 30, and 92 days after soil rewetting at 60% water holding capacity (resilience). Microbial activities involved in soil functions such as carbon cycling and phosphate dynamics proved to be of low resistance in all soils except for IS; however, they were resilient and recovered rapidly after rewetting. On the other hand, the microbial activities and gene abundances that were measured in relation to nitrogen cycling processes showed that for denitrification, activities were more rapidly resilient than gene abundances whereas for nitrification the activities and gene abundances were resilient in the same way. Results suggest that, unless the soils contain high amounts of organic matter, microbial communities in imported soils can be more vulnerable to environmental pressures such as drought and heat than communities already present. This should be considered when rehabilitating degraded soils.

TI  - Impact of watershed-scale land restoration on soil microbial communities and their functions: Insights from metagenomic analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Land restoration in the gully regions of China's Loess Plateau has significantly altered soil conditions and farming practices, yet its impact on soil microbes remains unclear. This study applied metagenomic sequencing and correlation analysis to examine microbial community shifts and key genes involved in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling. Results show increased biodiversity and microbial activity, especially downstream, enhancing carbon metabolism and ecosystem resilience. Phosphorus activation improved, with related gene abundance rising by 27.45 %-52.57 %, facilitating phosphorus availability. Nitrogen cycling showed enhanced nitrification and nitrogen fixation, with reduced denitrification, promoting nitrogen retention. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and available phosphorus (AP), particularly AP, strongly influenced microbial dynamics. These findings highlight the positive role of land restoration in improving soil health and nutrient cycling, supporting sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Free amino sugar reactions in soil in relation to soil carbon and nitrogen cycling
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Amino sugars represent a major constituent of microbial cell walls and hydrolyzed soil organic matter. Despite their potential importance in soil nitrogen cycling, comparatively little is known about their dynamics in soil. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the behaviour of glucosamine in two contrasting grassland soil profiles. Our results show that both free amino sugars and amino acids represented only a small proportion of dissolved organic N and C pool in soil. Based upon our findings we hypothesize that the low concentrations of free amino sugars found in soils is due to rapid removal from the soil solution rather than slow rates of production. Further, we showed that glucosamine removal from solution was a predominantly biotic process and that its half-life in soil solution ranged from 1 to 3 h. The rates of turnover were similar to those of glucose at low substrate concentrations, however, at higher glucosamine concentrations its microbial use was much less than for glucose. We hypothesized that this was due to the lack of expression of a low affinity transport systems in the microbial community. Glucosamine was only weakly sorbed to the soil's solid phase (K-d = 6.4 +/- 1.0) and our results suggest that this did not limit its bioavailability in soil. Here we showed that glucosamine addition to soil resulted in rapid N mineralization and subsequent NO3- production. In contrast to some previous reports, our results suggest that free amino sugars turn over rapidly in soil and provide a suitable substrate for both microbial respiration and new biomass formation.

TI  - Symbiotic digestion of lignocellulose in termite guts
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Their ability to degrade lignocellulose gives termites an important place in the carbon cycle. This ability relies on their partnership with a diverse community of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic gut symbionts, which break down the plant fibre and ferment the products to acetate and variable amounts of methane, with hydrogen as a central intermediate. In addition, termites rely on the biosynthetic capacities of their gut microbiota as a nutritional resource. The mineralization of humus components in the guts of soil-feeding species also contributes to nitrogen cycling in tropical soils. Lastly, the high efficiency of their minute intestinal bioreactors makes termites promising models for the industrial conversion of lignocellulose into microbial products and the production of biofuels.

TI  - Continuous-cropping-tolerant soybean cultivars alleviate continuous cropping obstacles by improving structure and function of rhizosphere microorganisms
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionSoybean continuous cropping will change soil microorganisms and cause continuous cropping obstacles, resulting in a significant yield decline. Different soybean cultivars have different tolerances to continuous cropping, but the relationship between continuous cropping tolerance and soil microorganisms is not clear. MethodsTwo soybean cultivars with different tolerances to continuous cropping were used to study the effects of continuous cropping on soil physical and chemical properties, nitrogen and phosphorus cyclic enzyme activities, rhizosphere soil microbial community and function. ResultsThe results showed that the yield reduction rate of a continuous-cropping-tolerant cultivar (L14) was lower than that of a continuous-cropping-sensitive cultivar (L10) under continuous cropping. At R1 and R6 growth stages, soil nutrient content (NH4+-N, NO3--N, AP, DOM, TK, and pH), nitrogen cycling enzyme (URE, NAG, LAP) activities, phosphorus cycling enzyme (ALP, NPA, ACP) activities, copy numbers of nitrogen functional genes (AOA, AOB, nirK, nirK) and phosphorus functional genes (phoA, phoB) in L14 were higher than those in L10. Soybean cultivar was an important factor affecting the structure and functional structure of bacterial community under continuous cropping. The relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Acidobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota with L14 were significantly higher than those of L10. The complexity of the soil bacterial community co-occurrence network in L14 was higher than that in L10. DiscussionThe continuous-cropping-tolerant soybean cultivar recruited more beneficial bacteria, changed the structure and function of microbial community, improved soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, and reduced the impact of continuous cropping obstacles on grain yield.

TI  - Feedback of carbon and nitrogen cycles enhances carbon sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The efforts to explain the 'missing sink' for anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) have included in recent years the role of nitrogen as an important constraint for biospheric carbon fluxes. We used the Nitrogen Carbon Interaction Model (NCIM) to investigate patterns of carbon and nitrogen storage in different compartments of the terrestrial biosphere as a consequence of a rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, in combination with varying levels of nitrogen availability. This model has separate but closely coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles with a focus on soil processes and soil-plant interactions, including an active compartment of soil microorganisms decomposing litter residues and competing with plants for available nitrogen. Biological nitrogen fixation is represented as a function of vegetation nitrogen demand. The model was validated against several global datasets of soil and vegetation carbon and nitrogen pools. Five model experiments were carried out for the modeling periods 1860-2002 and 2002-2100. In these experiments we varied the nitrogen availability using different combinations of biological nitrogen fixation, denitrification, leaching of soluble nitrogen compounds with constant or rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Oversupply with nitrogen, in an experiment with nitrogen fixation, but no nitrogen losses, together with constant atmospheric CO2, led to some carbon sequestration in organismic pools, which was nearly compensated by losses of C from soil organic carbon pools. Rising atmospheric CO2 always led to carbon sequestration in the biosphere. Considering an open nitrogen cycle including dynamic nitrogen fixation, and nitrogen losses from denitrification and leaching, the carbon sequestration in the biosphere is of a magnitude comparable to current observation based estimates of the 'missing sink.' A fertilization feedback between the carbon and nitrogen cycles occurred in this experiment, which was much stronger than the sum of separate influences of high nitrogen supply and rising atmospheric CO2. The demand-driven biological nitrogen fixation was mainly responsible for this result. For the modeling period 2002-2100, NCIM predicts continued carbon sequestration in the low range of previously published estimates, combined with a plausible rate of CO2-driven biological nitrogen fixation and substantial redistribution of nitrogen from soil to plant pools.

TI  - Impact of phosphorus reduction combined with biofertilizer application on soil nutrients and microbial communities in arid oasis agricultural areas
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction Phosphorus reduction in agriculture is crucial for sustainable soil management, yet its interactive effects with microbial fertilizers on soil nutrient dynamics and microbial communities remain poorly understood.Methods Here, we evaluated the impacts of phosphorus reduction at four levels [0% (P100), 15% (P85), 30% (P70), and 100% (P0)] combined with two biofertilizers-Bacillus subtilis (BF1) and Bacillus mucilaginosus (BF2)-on soil available nutrients and bacterial community structure.Results Our results demonstrated that P85 combined with BF1 significantly enhanced soil microbial diversity, while P85 combined with BF2 notably increased the levels of available phosphorus and potassium, without significant changes in microbial diversity but with a more pronounced shift in community structure. Microbial community analysis revealed that under BF1 treatment, the proportion of Pseudomonadota, which dominates the carbon cycle, significantly increased. Meanwhile, BF2 treatment promoted the enrichment of Acidobacteriota and Planctomycetota, both involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles. Additionally, both biofertilizers significantly increased the abundance of aerobic and biofilm-forming bacteria. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that nitrogen cycle-related microbiota under BF1 treatment were the primary drivers of soil nutrient changes, whereas under BF2 treatment, Acidobacteriota, Chloroflexota, and Actinomycetota (involved in carbonnitrogen cycling and organic matter degradation) contributed more to nutrient enhancement. In conclusion, the application of two biofertilizers with P85 can optimize soil nutrient availability and regulate microbial community structure, with BF1 being more beneficial for maintaining microbial diversity and BF2 having a superior effect on enhancing available phosphorus and potassium.Conclusion The combined application of biofertilizers with phosphorus reduction demonstrates potential for improving soil health, thereby providing a scientific basis for promoting sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - Snow depth has greater influence on moss biocrusts' soil multifunctionality than the number of freeze-thaw cycles
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Continued global warming and changes in precipitation patterns, especially regarding snow depth and freezethaw cycles (FTCs), have significantly affected the hydrothermal environment in winter at mid- and highlatitudes. In this study, we assessed the effects of changes in snow depth and FTCs, on the biogeochemical cycling of biological soil crusts. We collected moss crust soil samples from a temperate desert in northwest China, and measured the changes in the amount of snow (65 % snow removal, ambient snow, and 65 % snow increase) and FTCs (FT0, FT5, and FT15) under an artificial environment simulation, to determine the nutrient content and enzyme activities related to soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles. In terms of how snowfall and FTCs affect soil multifunctionality (SMF) of desert moss crusts, the research findings demonstrated that snow depth, FTCs, and their interplay have a significant influence on the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus contents, enzyme activities, and SMF of moss crusts. Compared to snow removal, an increase in snow depth corresponded to a significant increase in the soil water content, and an improvement in soil carbon and nitrogen cycling and SMF. The number of FTCs increased, which led to enhancements in soil phosphorus cycling, soil total phosphorus, and available phosphorus content, together with a reduction in inorganic nitrogen content and the activities of certain enzymes involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. The structural equation model indicated that snow depth had the greatest effect (total effect of 0.165) on SMF in moss crusts compared to FTCs (total effect of 0.048). Therefore, it is necessary to consider snow depth when examining the effects of climate change on nutrient cycling in the biological soil crusts of temperate deserts.

TI  - Effect of rhizosphere soil microenvironment interaction on ginsenoside content in Panax ginseng: A case study of three-year-old agricultural ginseng
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
AB  - Planting ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) in farmland is the main method of ginseng cultivation, but the interaction between the rhizosphere soil microenvironment and the mechanism of ginsenoside accumulation in ginseng roots are still unclear. Therefore, the content of ginsenoside and rhizosphere soil microenvironment of 3year-old agricultural ginseng at two growth periods (May and October) were studied. The results showed that the content of bulk density, pH, alkaline nitrogen and organic matter in rhizosphere soil microenvironment significantly decreased. There were significant changes in the activities of carbon cycle related enzymes (amylase, invertase, cellulase etc.), nitrogen cycle related enzymes (urease, uricase, nitrate reductase, etc.), phosphorus cycle related enzymes (acid phosphatase, phytase), and sulfur cycle related enzymes (arylsulfatase) in rhizosphere. The decrease in keystone microbial diversity in a co-occurrence network was a manifestation of soil degradation at the biological level. Ginsenosides showed significant accumulation, with a 42.4% increase in the total content of ginsenosides. Environmental factors (pH, cellulase, and cation exchange capacity) significantly affected the accumulation of ginsenosides. The results of the co-occurrence network indicated that fungal communities were more susceptible to environmental factors than bacterial communities. Meanwhile, the structure and diversity of the fungal communities had a more significant impact on the accumulation of ginsenosides compared to the bacterial community. Comprehensive analysis showed that the interaction between environmental factors (pH, cellulase, cation exchange capacity) and soil microbiome (Coprinellus, Agaricales_unclassified, Mortierella) may be the key factor affecting ginsenoside accumulation in 3-year-old agricultural ginseng. The research results provide reference for soil environment improvement and the development of appropriate management measures based on the fertilizer requirements of ginseng, which can help achieve sustainable production of agricultural ginseng.

TI  - Temperature sensitivity of extracellular enzymes differs with peat depth but not with season in an ombrotrophic bog
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Peatlands contain a large portion of Earth's terrestrial soil organic matter in part due to a reduction in decomposition rates. Organic matter decomposition is initially mediated by extracellular enzyme activity, which is in turn controlled by temperature, moisture, and substrate availability; and all are subject to seasonal variation. As depth increases in peatlands, temperature variability and labile carbon inputs decrease. We hypothesized that the more stable recalcitrant subsurface would contain a smaller less diverse enzyme pool, that is better adapted to a narrow temperature range. Thus temperature dependence would be diminished at depth compared to superficial peat. Potential enzyme activity rates were determined across seasons and with depth in peat samples collected from the Marcell Experimental Forest in northern Minnesota, USA. The temperature dependence, assessed by activation energy, was quantified for three hydrolytic enzymes involved in nutrient cycling at up to 15 temperature points ranging from 2 degrees C to 65 degrees C. Potential enzyme activity decreased with peat depth as expected and corresponded with changes in peat composition and microbial biomass from the acrotelm to the catotelm. In an environmentally relevant temperature range (2-23 degrees C), activation energy decreased with depth for beta-glucosidase as predicted and leucine amino peptidase activation energy was the lowest of all enzymes. Stable temperatures at depth appear to result in a microbial community containing enzymes that have lower sensitivity to temperature increases. Surprisingly, there was no significant seasonal effect on enzyme temperature dependence observed in our study. Based on these results, and without shifts in microbial community composition, warming of peat could result in increased carbon and phosphorus cycling at the surface but little change at depth. Additionally differences in enzyme temperature sensitivity suggest nitrogen cycling could remain constant with warming, potentially resulting in proteolytic nitrogen cycling being decoupled from carbon and phosphorus cycling.

TI  - Soil microbial nitrogen cycling and nitrous oxide emissions from urban afforestation in the New York City Afforestation Project
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB  - The establishment of stands of trees in previously unforested areas (afforestation) is active in cities around the world. Given the complex and often degraded state of urban soils, there is great interest in soil biological processes that support plant growth but may also produce greenhouse gases in these new forests. We measured soil to atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) in order to determine how the presence/absence of shrubs and compost in urban afforestation site preparation affects the emission of this potent greenhouse gas. To complement the measurement of N2O flux, microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), potential net N mineralization and nitrification, microbial respiration, and soil inorganic N were measured in experimentally afforested plots in New York City, USA. Results suggest that afforestation with shrubs and trees stimulates smaller fluxes of N2O from soils than afforestation without shrubs and trees. The range of N2O flux observed from recently afforested plots was -0.031-0.641 ngN cm(-2) h(-1). There were no significant differences in N2O fluxes and microbial biomass C between sites with shrubs and/or one-time application of compost. The results suggest that afforestation efforts to create natural vegetation structure (i.e. canopy trees with understory plants) and foster a functional microbial community through additions of organic matter may not increase emissions of N2O to the atmosphere. Rather, this method of afforestation site preparation may tighten C and N cycles and leave N2O emissions in these urban ecosystems unchanged. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Meta-Analysis Study on the Role of Biochar on Soil Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Soil nitrogen cycling is intricately related to soil physicochemical properties, enzymatic activity, and microbial vitality. Biochar, containing various elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, possesses a porous structure with strong adsorption capabilities. This characteristic renders it useful for ameliorating acidic soils, influencing soil nitrogen cycling, and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. To quantitatively analyze the diverse impacts of different biochar on soil nitrogen cycling and to highlight its implications for sustainable agriculture, this study collected 155 relevant articles and conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis. The results indicate that biochar can elevate the pH by 4.60% for acidic soils and significantly increase soil organic carbon content by 64.60%. Different feedstocks, such as Wooden Biochar (WB), Crop Husk (CH) Biochar, Crop Straw Biochar (CS), and Organic Waste Biochar (OW), exhibit distinct effects, with WB and OW showing the most significant increases in SOC. Pyrolysis temperature is also a critical factor, and biochar produced at medium and high temperatures enhances pH more effectively than low-temperature biochar. Additionally, biochar enhances the abundance of the nitrogen functional gene amoA-AOB by 25.58%, promoting ammonia oxidation, reducing ammonia (NH3) emissions by 16.39%. Experimental setups also influence outcomes that biochar application in woods and incubation studies significantly reduced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions compared to pot and field experiments. The findings suggest that adding biochar to soil accelerates nitrogen cycling, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The results advocate biochar's use in sustainable soil management practices.

TI  - Earthworms increase forest litter mass loss irrespective of deposited compounds - A field manipulation experiment in subtropical forests
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Earthworms modulate carbon and nitrogen cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, but their effect may be compromised by the deposition of pollutants from industrial emissions. However, studies investigating how deposited compounds affect the role of earthworms in carbon cycling such as litter decomposition are lacking, although the interactions of earthworms and deposited compounds are important for understanding the impact of pollutants on ecosystems and the potential of earthworms in bioremediation. We performed a 365-day in situ litterbag decomposition experiment in a deciduous (Quercus variabilis) and coniferous (Pinus massoniana) forest in southeast China. We manipulated nitrogen (N), sodium (Na), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as model compounds during litter decomposition with and without earthworms (Eisenia fetida). After one year, N, Na, and PAH all slowed down litter mass loss, with the effects of Na being the strongest. By contrast, E. fetida generally increased litter mass loss, and the positive effects were uniformly maintained irrespective of the type of compounds added. However, the pathways to how earthworms increased litter mass loss varied among the compounds added and the two forests studied. As indicated by structural equation modeling, earthworms mitigated the negative effects of deposited compounds by directly increasing litter mass loss and indirectly increasing soil pH and microbial biomass. Overall, the results indicate that the acceleration of litter mass loss by earthworms is little affected by deposited compounds, and that earthworms have the potential to mitigate negative impacts of pollutants on litter decomposition and ecosystem processes.

TI  - Human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle: Sources and consequences
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Nitrogen is a key element controlling the species composition, diversity, dynamics, and functioning of many terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems. Many of the original plant species living in these ecosystems are adapted to, and function optimally in, soils and solutions with low levels of available nitrogen. The growth and dynamics of herbivore populations, and ultimately those of their predators, also are affected by N. Agriculture, combustion of fossil fuels, and other human activities have altered the global cycle of N substantially, generally increasing both the availability and the mobility of N over large regions of Earth. The mobility of N means that while most deliberate applications of N occur locally, their influence spreads regionally and even globally, Moreover, many of the mobile forms of N themselves have environmental consequences. Although most nitrogen inputs serve human needs such as agricultural production, their environmental consequences are serious and long term.
   Based on our review of available scientific evidence, we are certain that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have:
   1) approximately doubled the rate of nitrogen input into the terrestrial nitrogen cycle, with these rates still increasing;
   2) increased concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas N2O globally, and increased concentrations of other oxides of nitrogen that drive the formation of photochemical smog over large regions of Earth;
   3) caused losses of soil nutrients, such as calcium and potassium, that are essential for the long-term maintenance of soil fertility;
   4) contributed substantially to the acidification of soils, streams, and lakes in several regions; and
   5) greatly increased the transfer of nitrogen through rivers to estuaries and coastal oceans. In addition, based on our review of available scientific evidence we are confident that human alterations of the nitrogen cycle have:
   6) increased the quantity of organic carbon stored within terrestrial ecosystems;
   7) accelerated losses of biological diversity, especially losses of plants adapted to efficient use of nitrogen, and losses of the animals and microorganisms that depend on them; and
   8) caused changes in the composition and functioning of estuarine and nearshore ecosystems, and contributed to long-term declines in coastal marine fisheries.

TI  - Differential impacts of microplastics on carbon and nitrogen cycling in plant-soil systems: A meta-analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are widely present in terrestrial ecosystems. However, how MPs impact carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling within plant-soil system is still poorly understood. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis utilizing 3338 paired observations from 180 publications to estimate the effects of MPs on plant growth (biomass, nitrogen content, nitrogen uptake and nitrogen use efficiency), change in soil C content (total carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC)), C losses (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane), soil N content (total nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, microbial biomass nitrogen, total dissolve nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate (NO3--N) and nitrite) and nitrogen losses (nitrous oxide, ammonia (NH3) volatilization and N leaching) comprehensively. Results showed that although MPs significantly increased CO2 emissions by 25.7 %, they also increased TC, SOC, MBC, DOC and CO2 by 53.3 %, 25.4 %, 19.6 % and 24.7 %, respectively, and thus increased soil carbon sink capacity. However, MPs significantly decreased NO3--N and NH3 volatilization by 14.7 % and 43.3 %, respectively. Meanwhile, MPs significantly decreased plant aboveground biomass, whereas no significant changes were detected in plant belowground biomass and plant N content. The impacts of MPs on soil C, N and plant growth varied depending on MP types, sizes, concentrations, and experimental durations, in part influenced by initial soil properties. Overall, although MPs enhanced soil carbon sink capacity, they may pose a significant threat to future agricultural productivity.

TI  - Methane-Derived Zero-Valent Carbon Solids Differentially Impact Model Nitrogen Cycling Bacteria and Significantly Inhibit Nitrification
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Pyrolysis of hydrocarbons holds promise for reducing CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production. This process co-produces solid zero-valent carbon (ZVC), which could be used similarly to biochar as an agricultural soil amendment. Since soil is the largest potential repository of ZVC, it is important to assess its potential impact on soil microbial ecosystem services, including the nitrogen cycle. Thus, we assessed how ZVC affects the growth and nitrogen cycling gene expression of three model bacteria: The nitrogen fixer was Azotobacter vinelandii, the nitrifier Nitrosomonas europaea, and the denitrifier Pseudomonas stutzeri. All bacteria attached to ZVC and charcoal (control), and neither noticeably affected the growth or activity of A. vinelandii and P. stutzeri. In contrast, ZVC significantly hindered the growth of N. europaea, down-regulated genes involved in ammonia oxidation, and reduced ammonium consumption. If such effects were pervasive in other nitroegn cycling soil bacteria, ZVC would potentially create a nitrogen cycle bottleneck by inhibiting nitrification, which would increase ammonia accumulation, possibly decreasing nitrogen fertilizer requirements but increasing NH3 volatilization. This bottleneck would also restrict downstream processes like nitrate production, subsequent nitrate leaching, and denitrification, thus decreasing NOx emissions and emissions of the greenhouse gas N2O. Overall, ZVC could impact nitrogen cycling, with important implications for environmental pollution and climate change.

TI  - Plants and related carbon cycling under elevated ground-level ozone: A mini review
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Plants play a crucial role in global carbon biogeochemical cycling and natural terrestrial carbon sinks. Dynamic changes in plant-related carbon cycling processes under changing climate and atmospheric compositions are hot scientific issues concerning carbon neutrality. Ozone, as a damaging oxidant, shows a rising trend near the ground where plants grow, directly and indirectly impacting forests and other types of vegetation. This review focuses on the effects of elevated atmospheric ozone levels on plant-related carbon cycling processes, including carbon dioxide (CO2) assimilation, carbon allocation to roots, volatile emissions, soil carbon sequestration and litter decomposition. Based on previous studies, we propose that field observations, especially in situ long-term observations under natural growing conditions in well-designed networks with a better representation, are needed to deeply understand the effects of elevated ozone on plants. Apart from an overwhelming concern about the influence of ozone on crop yields, studies on the effects of elevated ozone on forests, especially tropical and subtropical forests, should be strengthened in the future. Meanwhile, the interactions between ozone and plants should be considered in understanding plants' feedback to oxidants through emissions of volatiles and other trace gases. Moreover, geochemical techniques such as carbon isotopes and molecular markers, along with big data and artificial intelligence approaches, can be extensively used to decode and constrain the ozone-plant re-lationships, such as those between net primary productivity and ozone.

TI  - Ecosystem and Climate Change Impacts on the Nitrogen Cycle and Biodiversity
T2  - NITROGEN
AB  - Nitrogen in all of its forms sustains Earth. In every known terrestrial and aquatic habitat, nitrogen controls microbial activity, plant productivity, trophic dynamics, and animal and human growth. This review has tried to show how nitrogen cycling is influenced by both terrestrial and marine ecosystems in addition to by changes spurred on by the climate. The availability, transformation, and final fate of nitrogen throughout the various ecosystems are influenced by these interconnected biochemical and biophysical processes, which are fueled by microbial communities. Predicting and reducing human impacts on the changing ecosystem requires an understanding of these complex interconnections. Anthropogenic and climatic changes alter the structure and function of soil microbial communities, as well as the main metabolic processes of the nitrogen cycle, such as nitrification, denitrification, nitrogen fixation, and ammonification. The mechanisms by which anthropogenic stress alters nitrogen cycling processes, the effects on ecosystem function, and possible mitigation techniques for a balanced nitrogen cycle are all discussed in this review.

TI  - An analytical solution to study substrate-microbial dynamics in soils
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
AB  - We provide an approximate analytical solution for the substrate-microbial dynamics of the organic carbon cycle in natural soils under hydro-climatic variable forcing conditions. The model involves mass balance in two carbon pools: substrate and biomass. The analytical solution is based on a perturbative solution of concentrations, and can properly reproduce the numerical solutions for the full non-linear problem in a system evolving towards a steady state regime governed by the amount of labile carbon supplied to the system. The substrate and the biomass pools exhibit two distinct behaviors depending on whether the amount of carbon supplied is below or above a given threshold. In the latter case, the concentration versus time curves are always monotonic. Contrarily, in the former case the C-pool concentrations present oscillations, allowing the reproduction of non-monotonic small-scale biomass concentration data in a natural soil, observed so far only in short-term experiments in the rhizosphere. Our results illustrate the theoretical dependence of oscillations from soil moisture and temperature and how they may be masked at intermediate scales due to the superposition of solutions with spatially variable parameters.

TI  - The spatial distribution and biogeochemical drivers of nitrogen cycle genes in an Antarctic desert
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Antarctic deserts, such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV), represent extremely cold and dry environments. Consequently, MDV are suitable for studying the environment limits on the cycling of key elements that are necessary for life, like nitrogen. The spatial distribution and biogeochemical drivers of nitrogen-cycling pathways remain elusive in the Antarctic deserts because most studies focus on specific nitrogen-cycling genes and/or organisms. In this study, we analyzed metagenome and relevant environmental data of 32 MDV soils to generate a complete picture of the nitrogen-cycling potential in MDV microbial communities and advance our knowledge of the complexity and distribution of nitrogen biogeochemistry in these harsh environments. We found evidence of nitrogen-cycling genes potentially capable of fully oxidizing and reducing molecular nitrogen, despite the inhospitable conditions of MDV. Strong positive correlations were identified between genes involved in nitrogen cycling. Clear relationships between nitrogen-cycling pathways and environmental parameters also indicate abiotic and biotic variables, like pH, water availability, and biological complexity that collectively impose limits on the distribution of nitrogen-cycling genes. Accordingly, the spatial distribution of nitrogen-cycling genes was more concentrated near the lakes and glaciers. Association rules revealed non-linear correlations between complex combinations of environmental variables and nitrogen-cycling genes. Association rules for the presence of denitrification genes presented a distinct combination of environmental variables from the remaining nitrogen-cycling genes. This study contributes to an integrative picture of the nitrogen-cycling potential in MDV.

TI  - Root Exudation by an Annual Grass Modifies Soil Biogeochemical Cycling: A Mechanism for Invasion
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Annual grass invasion is a global ecological problem. Invasive annual grasses are thought to alter biogeochemical cycles, particularly nitrogen (N), through positive belowground feedbacks. Nitrogen acquisition is hypothesized to be a key factor driving invasion, but the mechanisms by which invasive annual grasses access nitrogen remain unclear. We investigated the influence of root exudation on the soil environment beneath cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), an invasive annual grass that is widespread across North America. In a greenhouse experiment, we contrasted the effects of drought on root exudation by cheatgrass and a grass that is native to the western USA (squirreltail; Elymus elymoides), and subsequent effects on soil processes. This was followed by an incubation experiment that directly tested how root exudates influence soil biogeochemical cycling. We found that throughout the greenhouse experiment, droughted cheatgrass plants acquired more nitrogen than squirreltail or their watered counterparts. Cheatgrass soils had lower nitrifier abundance and net nitrification rates, as well as accelerated carbon cycling and greater microbial biomass compared to soils from beneath squirreltail. These effects were greatest in soils from cheatgrass plants that had experienced drought. Cheatgrass plants produced more root exudates, which had greater organic acid content. When experimentally added to soil, root exudates from cheatgrass accelerated microbial respiration and decreased net nitrification-mirroring observations in greenhouse soils. Effects were strongest with exudates from droughted cheatgrass. Our findings suggest that by stimulating heterotrophic soil microbes, cheatgrass root exudates increased carbon cycling and altered the rate at which nitrogen becomes available in the rhizosphere. When considering cheatgrass' phenology, root exudation may provide cheatgrass with greater access to soil nitrogen in dry conditions compared to native species.

TI  - Effects of ridge-furrow mulching system and limited supplementary irrigation on soil microbial community structure, function and carbon emissions
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - Limited supplementary irrigation under the ridge-furrow mulching planting technology (R) is an important high-efficiency water-saving agricultural measure promoted in the dryland area. To systematically clarify the mechanism of R and supplementary irrigation on soil microorganisms and carbon emissions in farmland, this study investigated dryland farming systems under R with three irrigation amount, using traditional planting (T) as the control, the effects of different irrigation on soil microbial community structure, carbon cycle function gene diversity, carbohydrate-active enzymes and carbon emissions were explored. The results showed that R and supplementary irrigation significantly changed the carbon emission. R increased the CO2 emission and decreased the CH4 absorption. It increased the microbial richness but had no significant impact on species diversity, Sphingomonasy and Nocardioides were dominant bacterial groups in farmland. The functional gene diversity of carbon cycle and carbohydrate-active enzymes were studied, in the same irrigation treatment, the Ace and Shannon index of carbon cycle function genes in R increased by 0.05 %-4.85 % and 0.48 %-3.86 % compared with T. The abundance of GTs and GHs under R increased by 3.20 %-20.97 % and 0.68 %-14.00 %, while the CEs family decreased significantly by 34.72 %-36.31 %. Pearson analysis indicated that the cultivation patterns and supplementary irrigation mainly affected farmland carbon emissions by influencing shannon index of carbon cycle functional genes, bacterial Lysobacter, carbohydrate-active enzymes GH74 and PL22. The results of this study can provide a scientific basis for a deeper understanding of the microbial-mediated carbon cycle process under the R with limited supplementary irrigation in dryland farming areas.

TI  - Deposition and decomposition of cattle dung and its impact on soil properties and plant growth in a cool-temperate pasture
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Livestock dung provides an important direct pathway by which carbon and nutrients enter soils in pasture ecosystems and affects carbon and nitrogen cycling indirectly through changes in soil and plant properties. Here, we quantify dung deposition, decomposition, and the effects of dung on soil and plants in a Zoysia japonica grassland in Japan. We determined (1) the distribution of dung, (2) the mass loss rate of dung and the amount of carbon respired as CO2, and (3) changes in soil properties and aboveground biomass of Z. japonica. Dung deposition was 4.0-9.7 g C and 0.4-1.0 g N m(-2) year(-1) and distributed patchily (Morishita's I (delta) > 1). Most (71 %) of the carbon in dung deposited in June was lost within a single grazing period by aerobic decomposition, more than mass loss rate of Z. japonica litter in the first year (about 50 %), suggesting that grazing and defecation can accelerate carbon cycling compared with the typical litterfall-decomposition regime. Nitrogen in dung mass entered the soil as ammonium nitrogen and was nitrified. The spatiotemporal distribution of these processes corresponded to that of stimulated Z. japonica growth. These results suggested that dung deposition significantly affected the inorganic nitrogen status of soil and, therefore, the growth of Z. japonica. However, these effects were very restricted temporally (July-August) and spatially (within 10 cm from dung edge). Thus, such spatiotemporally restricted effects combined with the patchy distribution of dung may contribute to the heterogeneous structure of pasture ecosystems.

TI  - Destruction of the soil microbial ecological environment caused by the over-utilization of the rice-crayfish co-cropping pattern
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The rice-crayfish co-cropping pattern is a traditional method for the intensive utilization of rice fields. In recent years, this pattern has been over-developed in many countries and regions, especially in China, because of its simple agronomic technology and high economic benefits. However, little is known about the potential ecological problems regarding soil microorganisms caused by the over-utilization of this pattern. The results show that rice-crayfish co-cropping, when over-utilized for a long time, reduced soil microbial richness and diversity compared with rice monocropping. A decrease in bacterial abundance in the nitrogen cycle and an increase in bacterial abundance in the carbon cycle led to a decrease in the nitrogen cycle function and an increase in the carbon cycle function. In an analysis of bacteria that are sensitive to cropping patterns, it was found that in the rice crayfish co-cropping, the relative abundances of sensitive OTUs from Firmicutes (Bacillus and Clostridium) and Chloroflexi (Anaerolineaceae) were significantly higher during the entire growth period than those observed in the rice monocropping pattern, while the relative abundances of sensitive OTUs from Nitrospirae (Nitrospira), Gemmatimonadetes (Gemmatimonas), and Actinobacteria (Nocardioides) were significantly lower than those observed in the rice monocropping pattern. A network analysis shows that growth-period-sensitive OTUs drive the co-occurrence network modules, although the OTUs also have positive and negative correlations among modules but a positive synergistic effect on the regulation of soil nutrients. In addition, OTUs that were sensitive at the booting stage and filling stage were the key microbial groups in the rice-crayfish co-cropping and rice monocropping networks, respectively. Understanding the classifications and functions of sensitive microbes present during the rice growth period is the basis for formulating a microbial flora management strategy for the rice-crayfish co-cropping pattern, which is of great significance for adjusting agricultural management measures and controlling current soil microbial ecological problems.

TI  - The bacterial microbiota in florfenicol contaminated soils: The antibiotic resistome and the nitrogen cycle
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Soil antibiotic resistome and the nitrogen cycle are affected by florfenicol addition to manured soils but their interactions have not been fully described. In the present study, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and nitrogen cycle genes possessed by soil bacteria were characterized using real-time fluorescence quantification PCR (qPCR) and metagenomic sequencing in a short-term (30 d) soil model experiment. Florfenicol significantly changed in the abundance of genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, tetracyclines and macrolides. And the abundance of Sphingomonadaceae, the protein metabolic and nitrogen metabolic functions, as well as NO reductase, nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase and N2O reductase can also be affected by florfenicol. In this way, ARG types of genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactamases, tetracyclines, colistin, fosfomycin, phenicols and trimethoprim were closely associated with multiple nitrogen cycle genes. Actinobacteria, Chlorobi, Firmicutes, Gemmatimo-nadetes, Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia played an important role in spreading of ARGs. Moreover, soil physicochemical properties were important factors affecting the distribution of soil flora. This study provides a theoretical basis for further exploration of the transmission regularity and interference mechanism of ARGs in soil bacteria responsible for nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Responses and microbial mechanisms of greenhouse gas emissions and multifunctionality of soils at different elevations in Changbai Mountain under warming conditions
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Mountains experience vertical variations in forest types and present different vegetation zones due to changes in topography and climate. Mountain environments are particularly sensitive to the effects of global warming, which has resulted in changes in the distribution of vegetation zones. Therefore, soil greenhouse gas emissions and their mechanisms in different vegetation zones under climate warming require further investigation. In this study, we conducted in-situ gradient shift warming experiments to evaluate the response of soil greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and multifunctionality in Changbai Mountain. Our results showed that warming increased soil CO2 and N2O emissions while enhancing CH4 uptake in all four vegetation zones. The responses of soil CO2 and N2O emissions, as well as global warming potential, were more pronounced in coniferous forests. The sensitivity of CH4 uptake to warming was highest in mixed coniferous-broadleaf forests. Microbial Shannon diversity was crucial for explaining the variations in CO2 and N2O emissions, whereas NO3--N levels primarily explained the variations in CH4 uptake. Metagenomic analysis indicated that the functional profiles of microbial communities associated with soil carbon and nitrogen cycles changed across the four vegetation zones due to warming. Furthermore, climate warming decreased the multifunctionality of the mixed coniferous-broadleaf forest zone. PLS-PM revealed that microbial diversity and soil properties negatively impacted soil greenhouse gas emissions and positively affected soil multifunctionality, while warming positively influenced functional genes that are related to carbon and nitrogen cycles. These findings enhance our understanding of how climate warming impacts soil GHGs, carbon and nitrogen cycling, and ecosystem functions in mountain ecosystems, and are essential for mountain ecosystem management.

TI  - Microbial Nitrogen-Cycle Gene Abundance in Soil of Cropland Abandoned for Different Periods
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In Inner Mongolia, steppe grasslands face desertification or degradation because of human overuse and abandonment after inappropriate agricultural management. The soils in these abandoned croplands exist in heterogeneous environments characterized by widely fluctuating microbial growth. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of microbial genes encoding proteins involved in the nitrogen cycle was used to study Azotobacter species, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers in the soils from steppe grasslands and croplands abandoned for 2, 6, and 26 years. Except for nitrifying archaea and nitrous oxide-reducing bacteria, the relative genotypic abundance of microbial communities involved in nitrogen metabolism differed by approximately 2- to 10-fold between abandoned cropland and steppe grassland soils. Although nitrogen-cycle gene abundances varied with abandonment time, the abundance patterns of nitrogen-cycle genes separated distinctly into abandoned cropland versus light-grazing steppe grassland, despite the lack of any cultivation for over a quartercentury. Plant biomass and plant diversity exerted a significant effect on the abundance of microbial communities that mediate the nitrogen cycle (P < 0.002 and P < 0.03, respectively). The present study elucidates the ecology of bacteria that mediate the nitrogen cycle in recently abandoned croplands.

TI  - Contrasting Soil Bacterial Community, Diversity, and Function in Two Forests in China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Bacteria are the highest abundant microorganisms in the soil. To investigate bacteria community structures, diversity, and functions, contrasting them in four different seasons all the year round with/within two different forest type soils of China. We analyzed soil bacterial community based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing via Illumina HiSeq platform at a temperate deciduous broad-leaved forest (Baotianman, BTM) and a tropical rainforest (Jianfengling, JFL). We obtained 51,137 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and classified them into 44 phyla and 556 known genera, 18.2% of which had a relative abundance >1%. The composition in each phylum was similar between the two forest sites. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the most abundant phyla in the soil samples between the two forest sites. The Shannon index did not significantly differ among the four seasons at BTM or JFL and was higher at BTM than JFL in each season. The bacteria community at both BTM and JFL showed two significant (P < 0.05) predicted functions related to carbon cycle (anoxygenic photoautotrophy sulfur oxidizing and anoxygenic photoautotrophy) and three significant (P <. 0.05) predicted functions related to nitrogen cycle (nitrous denitrificaton, nitrite denitrification, and nitrous oxide denitrification). We provide the basis on how changes in bacterial community composition and diversity leading to differences in carbon and nitrogen cycles at the two forests.

TI  - Recovery of microbially mediated processes in soil augmented with a pentachlorophenol-mineralizing bacterium
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
AB  - Specific physiological groups can be used to evaluate the recovery of soil microbial communities following disturbance. In this study, soil was contaminated with pentachlorophenol (PCP) to assess the resiliency of microorganisms responsible for carbon and nitrogen cycling. Methane fluxes were monitored in soil microcosms to evaluate the effects of contamination and augmentation on microbial populations involved in carbon cycling. The addition of a PCP-mineralizing bacterium, Sphingomonas chlorophenolica strain RA2, enhanced the recovery of methane-oxidizing capacity relative to uninoculated treatments when soil was contaminated with low concentrations of PCP (10 and 50 mu g/g soil, ppm). At the highest level of PCP contamination tested (300 ppm), there was no recovery of methane-oxidizing capacity whether or not the PCP-mineralizing bacterium was added to soil. The nitrogen-cycling capacity of contaminated and augmented soil was tested by measuring nitrification potentials. The addition of PCP resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in nitrification rates. After three months of incubation, all augmented soils had nitrification rates equivalent to the uncontaminated control, and the uninoculated soils contaminated with 100 and 300 ppm PCP still were impaired in their nitrification potentials. These results indicate that biological removal of a contaminant has the potential to restore microbially mediated processes to levels observed prior to contamination.

TI  - The Biogeographic Pattern of Microbial Functional Genes along an Altitudinal Gradient of the Tibetan Pasture
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - As the highest place of the world, the Tibetan plateau is a fragile ecosystem. Given the importance of microbial communities in driving soil nutrient cycling, it is of interest to document the microbial biogeographic pattern here. We adopted a microarray-based tool named GeoChip 4.0 to investigate grassland microbial functional genes along an elevation gradient from 3200 to 3800 m above sea level open to free grazing by local herdsmen and wild animals. Interestingly, microbial functional diversities increase with elevation, so does the relative abundances of genes associated with carbon degradation, nitrogen cycling, methane production, cold shock and oxygen limitation. The range of Shannon diversities (10.27-10.58) showed considerably smaller variation than what was previously observed at ungrazed sites nearby (9.95-10.65), suggesting the important role of livestock grazing on microbial diversities. Closer examination showed that the dissimilarity of microbial community at our study sites increased with elevations, revealing an elevation-decay relationship of microbial functional genes. Both microbial functional diversity and the number of unique genes increased with elevations. Furthermore, we detected a tight linkage of greenhouse gas (CO2) and relative abundances of carbon cycling genes. Our biogeographic study provides insights on microbial functional diversity and soil biogeochemical cycling in Tibetan pastures.

TI  - Microbial roles in the terrestrial and aquatic nitrogen cycle-implications in climate change
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Soil Microorganisms regulate the nitrogen cycle and influence climate change.
   Nitrogen, as an essential component for living organisms, is the primary limiting nutrient on Earth. The availability and effective utilization of nitrogenous compounds for metabolic and other essential biochemical reactions are dependent on the myriad and phylogenetically diverse microbial communities. The microorganisms harmoniously interact and participate in every reaction of the nitrogen cycle to continuously transform nitrogen into its various bio-available forms. Research on the nitrogen cycle continues to disclose that there are many reactions that remain unknown. In this review, we summarize the recent discoveries that have contributed to advancing our understanding of the microbial involvement in reactions of the nitrogen cycle in soil and aquatic systems that influence climate change. Additionally, the mini-review highlights, which anthropogenic activities cause disturbances in the nitrogen cycle and proposes how beneficial microbes may be harnessed to replenish nitrogen in agricultural ecosystems.

TI  - Post-agricultural tropical forest regeneration shifts soil microbial functional potential for carbon and nutrient cycling
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Natural forest regeneration on abandoned agricultural land is an increasingly common, but understudied, landcover change in the tropics. We studied whether observed changes in microbial community composition with forest regeneration led to changes in functional potential. We used GeoChip 3.0 to measure microbial functional potential for carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and sulfur (S) cycling genes in pastures, early successional, and late successional forests in Puerto Rico. We found lower abundance and diversity of genes involved in C, N, and P in late successional forests compared to other landcover types. Soil microbial communities were functionally similar in active pastures and early successional forests. Our results suggest microbial functional potential varies with forest age, with potential implications for tropical biogeochemistry.

TI  - Impacts of wetland degradation on soil microbial networks and functions in northern China
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Wetlands are widely distributed across various regions of the Northern Hemisphere and play a critical role in the Earth's carbon sink. Currently, anthropogenic activities have greatly affected the natural environment of wetlands, subsequently altering the trajectory of ecosystem transition. However, how wetland degradation alters the stability and functioning of soil microbial networks-a critical regulator of carbon and nitrogen cycling-remains to be further investigated. A comprehensive study conducted in the Sanjiang Plain, China, examined microbial and functional changes across four wetland types along a degradation gradient: jungle swamp, scrub swamp, wet meadow, and marshy meadow. Analysis revealed three key findings: First, soil properties and microbial communities varied significantly across degradation stages, with scrub swamps exhibiting the highest nitrogen availability and microbial diversity, supported by elevated nifH gene abundance and nitrogen fixation potential. Second, degradation destabilized microbial networks, as evidenced by a progressive reduction in microbial connectivity from jungle swamps to marshy meadows. Third, carbon metabolism emerged as the most critical microbial function during degradation, with soil NH4+ and pH identified as primary environmental drivers of microbial community structure and function. These findings provide critical insights into the ecological consequences of wetland degradation and offer a scientific foundation for the development of targeted conservation strategies in these vulnerable ecosystems.

TI  - Empirical evidence and theoretical understanding of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycle interactions
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Interactions between carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in terrestrial ecosystems are simulated in advanced vegetation models, yet methodologies vary widely, leading to divergent simulations of past land C balance trends. This underscores the need to reassess our understanding of ecosystem processes, given recent theoretical advancements and empirical data. We review current knowledge, emphasising evidence from experiments and trait data compilations for vegetation responses to CO2 and N input, alongside theoretical and ecological principles for modelling. N fertilisation increases leaf N content but inconsistently enhances leaf-level photosynthetic capacity. Whole-plant responses include increased leaf area and biomass, with reduced root allocation and increased aboveground biomass. Elevated atmospheric CO2 also boosts leaf area and biomass but intensifies belowground allocation, depleting soil N and likely reducing N losses. Global leaf traits data confirm these findings, indicating that soil N availability influences leaf N content more than photosynthetic capacity. A demonstration model based on the functional balance hypothesis accurately predicts responses to N and CO2 fertilisation on tissue allocation, growth and biomass, offering a path to reduce uncertainty in global C cycle projections.

TI  - Geo-distribution pattern of microbial carbon cycling genes responsive to petroleum contamination in continental horizontal oilfields
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Contamination significantly affects soilmicrobial community structures, and themetabolisms of organic contaminants might particularly alter soil carbon cycling by shaping microbial carbon cycling genes. Although numerous studies have discussed the impacts of petroleum contamination on soil bacterial communities and relevant degrading genes, there is no work addressing how soil carbon cycling genes are affected by petroleum contamination. In this study, 77 soil sampleswere collected fromfive typical oilfields horizontally located in China to explore the influence of environmental variables and petroleum contamination on microbial carbon cycling genes. Results from Geochip suggested a geographic-determined distribution of carbon cycling genes. Although no significant correlation was observed between carbon cycling genes and soil physio-chemical properties for all soils, some relationships were identified in specific oilfield. Principle component analysis indicated that soil physiochemical properties, rather than petroleum contamination disturbance, are the key factors determining the degree of sample dispersion, whereas environmental variables predominantly control the degree of sample aggregation. Co-occurrence ecological network analysis revealed a more complex interactions of all functional genes in petroleum-contaminated soils, and carbon cycling genes were grouped with nitrogen related genes in petroleum-contaminated communities. Soil moisture and heterogeneity were identified as the main drivers for the abundance and diversity of carbon cycling genes, particularly in petroleum-contaminated soils. These results are attributing to the fewer impacts of petroleumcontamination on the diversity of carbon cycling genes than soil physio-chemical properties, and soil carbon cycling genes are mainly driven by geographic location and petroleumcontamination together. Our findings provide deeper insight into the influence of petroleumcontamination in soil microbial functions related to carbon cycling. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Herbivore species identity and composition affect soil enzymatic activity through altered plant composition in a coastal tallgrass prairie
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Although single herbivore species are known to affect soil microbial communities, the effects of herbivore species identity and community composition on soil microbes and their functioning are unknown. We tested the effects of single orthopteran species and species combinations on soil enzymatic activity with an enclosure experiment in a coastal tallgrass prairie. Species effects on soil enzymatic activity were non-additive: one particular mixed feeding species (M. femurrubrum) resulted in 65% higher BG enzyme activity and 35% higher total hydrolytic enzyme activity, whereas certain combinations containing this species had little to no effects. These results suggest that critical species or combinations of species that strongly affect plant functional composition may also have strong effects on soil enzymatic functioning and nutrient limitation.

TI  - CARBON AND NITROGEN CYCLING DURING OLD-FIELD SUCCESSION - CONSTRAINTS ON PLANT AND MICROBIAL BIOMASS
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil C and N dynamics were studied in a sequence of old fields of increasing age to determine how these biogeochemical cycles change during secondary succession.  In addition, three different late-successional forests were studied to represent possible "steady state" conditions.  Surface soil samples collected from the fields and forests were analyzed for total C, H2O-soluble C, total N, potential net N mineralization, potential net nitrification, and microbial biomass.  Above-and belowground plant biomass was estimated within each of the old field sites.
   Temporal changes in soil organic C, total N and total plant biomass were best described by a gamma function [y = at(b) e(ctd) + f] whereas a simple exponential model [y = a(1 - e(-bt)) + c] provided the best fit to changes in H2O-soluble C, C:N ratio, microbial C, and microbial N.  Potential N mineralization and nitrification linearly increased with field age; however, rates were variable among the fields.  Microbial biomass was highly correlated to soil C and N pools and well correlated to the standing crop of plant biomass.  In turn, plant biomass was highly correlated to pools and rates of N cycling.
   Patterns of C and N cycling within the old field sites were different from those in a northern hardwood forest and a xeric oak forest; however, nutrient dynamics within an oak savanna were similar to those found in a 60-yr old field.  Results suggest that patterns in C and N cycling within the old-field chronosequence were predictable and highly correlated to the accrual of plant and microbial biomass.

TI  - Mycorrhizal Complexes and Their Role in the Ecology of Boreal Forests (Review)
T2  - BIOLOGY BULLETIN
AB  - The functioning of mycorrhizal associations in forest ecosystems is discussed. Mycorrhizae are involved in supplying plants with nutrients and improve their growth, but they can also inhibit plant development. The level of participation of ecto-ericoid mycorrhizae in the carbon cycle of boreal forests is considered to be very significant. According to isotope indications, the role of mycorrhizae in the nitrogen cycle is high in the tundra and less pronounced in boreal forests. Mycorrhizae are involved in the decomposition of soil OM to obtain available nitrogen, but the enzymatic mechanisms of this process and the pathways for the movement of N and P from fungal cells to plants are largely unknown. Mycorrhizae prevent nitrogen losses from forest soils during leaching. Mycorrhizal networks contribute to the processes of reforestation and structuring of plantations and protect against pathogens and pests.

TI  - Potential of Svalbard reindeer winter droppings for emission/absorption of methane and nitrous oxide during summer
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
AB  - Droppings of Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) could affect the carbon and nitrogen cycles in tundra ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of reindeer droppings originating from the winter diet for emission and/or absorption of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in summer. An incubation experiment was conducted over 14 days using reindeer droppings and mineral subsoil collected from a mound near Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, to determine the potential exchanges of CH4 and N2O for combinations of two factors, reindeer droppings (presence or absence) and soil moisture (dry, moderate, or wet). A line transect survey was conducted to determine the distribution density of winter droppings at the study site. The incubation experiment showed a weak absorption of CH4 and a weak emission of N2O. Reindeer droppings originating from the winter diet had a negligible effect on the exchange fluxes of both CH4 and N2O. Although the presence of droppings resulted in a short-lasting increase in N2O emissions on day 1 (24 h from the start) for moderate and wet conditions, the emission rates were still very small, up to 3 mu g N2O m(-2) h(-1).

TI  - Carbon Fluxes in Soil Systems Supplemented with Glucose and Cadmium
T2  - UCHENYE ZAPISKI KAZANSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA ESTESTVENNYE NAUKI
AB  - Carbon fixation in soil, its transformation and mineralization are the important stages of carbon cycle regulating soil fertility and ecosystem stability. Organic fertilizers and toxic substances, such as heavy metals, lead to changes in the natural carbon flux. Organic and soluble organic carbon contents, microbial biomass, and cumulative respiratory activity have been measured for soils influenced by glucose and cadmium addition and sampled from various depths. Soluble organic compounds (here glucose) lead to a strong increase in metabolic activity, but they cause no carbon fixation in soil in the form of microbial biomass or insoluble compounds. The introduction of heavy metals into the soil has reduced the carbon flux rate through the soluble carbon pool, but has left the microbial biomass carbon unaffected. These effects turned out to be more pronounced in subsoils (below 20 cm) having low organic matter content.

TI  - Microplastics affect the nitrogen nutrition status of soybean by altering the nitrogen cycle in the rhizosphere soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are widely distributed in agricultural systems. However, studies on the comprehensive effects of MPs on nitrogen cycling in crop rhizosphere soil, and the changes this effect causes to crop growth is still limited. In this study, we investigated how three types of 5 % MPs (polystyrene, PS; polyethylene, PE; polyvinyl chloride, PVC) affect soybean growth by altering rhizosphere soil nitrogen cycling. These MPs have no direct toxic effects on soybean under hydroponic conditions. However, under soil cultivation conditions, PE and PS promoted soybean growth and increased soybean roots nitrogen content and nitrogen assimilation enzyme activity, while PVC does the opposite. Further study found that PE and PS increased the inorganic nitrogen content, and the activity of nitrogen cycle-related enzymes and the abundance of genes and microorganism in rhizosphere soil. Meanwhile, PVC significantly reduced the inorganic nitrogen contents, inhibited the activity of nitrogen cycling related enzymes, and destroyed the microbial community structure in rhizosphere soil. More importantly, PVC significantly reduced the abundance of nitrogen cycle-related genes and microorganisms, and increased the abundance of viruses. These results indicated that PE and PS promote soybean growth by activating the nitrogen cycle in the rhizosphere soil and increasing the soil nitrogen content, whereas PVC inhibits soybean growth by disrupting the nitrogen cycle in the rhizosphere soil and reducing its nitrogen content.

TI  - Differences in thallus chemistry are related to species-specific effects of biocrust-forming lichens on soil nutrients and microbial communities
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - It is well-known that vascular plants have species-specific effects on soil properties. However, little is known on how individual species forming biocrusts, communities dominated by lichens, mosses and cyanobacteria that are prevalent in many ecosystems world-wide, affect microbial communities and soil variables related to nutrient cycling.
   We evaluated the relationship of six biocrust-forming lichens (Buellia epipolia, Diploschistes diacapsis, Fulgensia subbracteata, Psora decipiens, Squamarina cartilaginea and Squamarina lentigera) with microbial abundance and multiple variables associated with soil nitrogen (N), carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) cycling and storage. We also evaluated whether the composition of lichen tissues (contents in C, N, P and polyphenols) is related to the C, N, P availability and microbial abundance in soils. Finally, we assessed what lichen species positively and negatively relate to soil fertility compared to bare ground areas without biocrusts.
   We found contrasted C, N, P availability and soil microbial abundance under the different biocrust-forming lichens. Interestingly, inorganic P and amino acids were the most important factors differentiating lichen microsites. These differences in nutrient availability seem to be related to the C, N and P composition of the lichen tissues. For example, soils under D.diacapsis and P.decipiens, which had the lowest and highest C, N and P contents in their tissues, respectively, had the lowest and highest nutrient availability, respectively. We also found contrasted soil microbes abundance under the different soil lichens. For instance, F.subbracteata and D.diacapsis were negatively related to the abundance of bacteria compared to bare ground areas.
   Our results support the idea that, as found with vascular plants, biocrust-forming lichens have species-specific effects on soil microbial communities and C, N and P cycling. Thus, continuing considering biocrusts as a unique entity will only add confusion to our knowledge of how they control nutrient availability and microbial abundance in the ecosystems where this key community is prevalent.

TI  - Straw is More Effective Than Biochar in Enhancing the Phosphorus Cycle Potential of Saline Soils
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - To investigate the impact of applying materials with high and low phosphorus contents on phosphorus availability and the potential of the phosphorus cycle in saline soils. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to investigate the effects of rice straw (RS, low in phosphorus) and biochar (B, high in phosphorus) treatments on phosphorus-cycling microbial communities and functional genes in saline soils, with conventional fertilization (CK1) serving as the control. The application of RS significantly increased soil available phosphorus fractions and NaOH-extractable inorganic phosphorus by 82.69% and 44.49%, respectively, compared to the CK1 and B treatments (P < 0.05). Additionally, only the RS treatment significantly increased soil total nitrogen (TN) and phosphodiesterase (PDEs) activity by 28.38-73.82%, while significantly reducing electrical conductivity (P < 0.05). Although both RS and B treatments altered and enhanced the diversity of phosphorus-cycling microbial communities, only the dominant genus in the RS treatment exhibited significant shifts. Furthermore, genes associated with phosphorus cycling were significantly upregulated exclusively in the RS treatment. These changes were primarily driven by PDE activity and TN levels, highlighting their critical roles in regulating the soil phosphorus cycle. According to the results of the partial least squares path model, changes in the available and refractory phosphorus fractions were mainly driven by phosphorus-cycling enzymes and phosphorus transport-related genes, respectively. The RS treatment represents a more promising strategy than biochar for enhancing the phosphorus-cycling potential of saline soils by altering the microbial community structure involved in phosphorus cycling and upregulating the expression of associated functional genes.

TI  - Excessive nitrogen addition accelerates N assimilation and P utilization by enhancing organic carbon decomposition in a Tibetan alpine steppe
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - High amounts of deposited nitrogen (N) dramatically influence the stability and functions of alpine ecosystems by changing soil microbial community functions, but the mechanism is still unclear. To investigate the impacts of increased N deposition on microbial community functions, a 2-year multilevel N addition (0, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 160 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) field experiment was set up in an alpine steppe on the Tibetan Plateau. Soil microbial functional genes (GeoChip 4.6), together with soil enzyme activity, soil organic compounds and environmental variables, were used to explore the response of microbial community functions to N additions. The results showed that the N addition rate of 40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) was the critical value for soil microbial functional genes in this alpine steppe. A small amount of added N (<= 40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) had no significant effects on the abundance of microbial functional genes, while high amounts of added N (>40 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) significantly increased the abundance of soil organic carbon degradation genes. Additionally, the abundance of microbial functional genes associated with NH4+, including ammonification, N fixation and assimilatory nitrate reduction pathways, was significantly increased under high N additions. Further, high N additions also increased soil organic phosphorus utilization, which was indicated by the increase in the abundance of phytase genes and alkaline phosphatase activity. Plant richness, soil NO2-/NH4+ and WSOC/WSON were significantly correlated with the abundance of microbial functional genes, which drove the changes in microbial community functions under N additions. These findings help us to predict that increased N deposition in the future may alter soil microbial functional structure, which will lead to changes in microbially-mediated biogeochemical dynamics in alpine steppes on the Tibetan Plateau and will have extraordinary impacts on microbial C, N and P cycles.

TI  - Unveiling the crucial role of soil microorganisms in carbon cycling: A review
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Soil microorganisms, by actively participating in the decomposition and transformation of organic matter through diverse metabolic pathways, play a pivotal role in carbon cycling within soil systems and contribute to the stabilization of organic carbon, thereby influencing soil carbon storage and turnover. Investigating the processes, mechanisms, and driving factors of soil microbial carbon cycling is crucial for understanding the functionality of terrestrial carbon sinks and effectively addressing climate change. This review comprehensively discusses the role of soil microorganisms in soil carbon cycling from three perspectives: metabolic pathways, microbial communities, and environmental influences. It elucidates the roles of different microbial species in carbon cycling and highlights the impact of microbial interactions and environmental factors on carbon cycling. Through the synthesis of 2171 relevant papers in the Web of Science Core database, we elucidated the ecological community structure, activity, and assembly mechanisms of soil microorganisms crucial to the soil carbon cycle that have been widely analyzed. The integration of soil microbial carbon cycle and its driving factors are vital for accurately predicting and modeling biogeochemical cycles and effectively addressing the challenges posed by global climate change. Such integration is vital for accurately predicting and modeling biogeochemical cycles and effectively addressing the challenges posed by global climate change.

TI  - The Microbiomes in Lichen and Moss Biocrust Contribute Differently to Carbon and Nitrogen Cycles in Arid Ecosystems
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) are distributed in arid and semiarid regions across the globe. Microorganisms are an essential component in biocrusts. They add and accelerate critical biochemical processes. However, little is known about the functional genes and metabolic processes of microbiomes in lichen and moss biocrust. This study used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to compare the microbiomes of lichen-dominated and moss-dominated biocrust and reveal the microbial genes and metabolic pathways involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling. The results showed that Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria were more abundant in moss biocrust than lichen biocrust, while Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria were more abundant in lichen biocrust than moss biocrust. The relative abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes and enzymes associated with carbon and nitrogen metabolism differed significantly between microbiomes of the two biocrust types. However, in the microbial communities of both biocrust types, respiration pathways dominated over carbon fixation pathways. The genes encoding carbon monoxide dehydrogenase were more abundant than those encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) involved in carbon fixation. Similarly, metabolic N-pathway diversity was dominated by nitrogen reduction, followed by denitrification, with nitrogen fixation the lowest proportion. Gene diversity involved in N cycling differed between the microbiomes of the two biocrust types. Assimilatory nitrate reduction genes had higher relative abundance in lichen biocrust, whereas dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes had higher relative abundance in moss biocrust. As dissolved organic carbon and soil organic carbon are considered the main drivers of the community structure in the microbiome of biocrust, these results indicate that biocrust type has a pivotal role in microbial diversity and related biogeochemical cycling.

TI  - Interrelationships among soil total C and N, microbial biomass, trace gas fluxes, and internal N-cycling in soils under pasture of the Amazon region
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationships and seasonal weather variations on soil total C and N concentrations, microbial biomass C pool, trace gas fluxes, and rates of internal N-cycling from soils under degraded pasture at Nova Vida ranch, Rondonia, Brazilian Amazon. We collected samples from soils and gas fluxes at the 5 soil types in April 2000 (end of the wet season) and in October 2001 (end of the dry season). Samples were analyzed in both seasons for soil microbial biomass C, soil total C and N, inorganic N, net N mineralization and net nitrification rates and some other soil properties. Overall, the effects of the season events upon soil properties were highly variable. The studied soils with high rates of CO, evolution but low rates of net N mineralization had high rates of N immobilization. The high immobilization rates suggest that the high CO2 evolution rates were associated with a growing microbial biomass. Moreover, in the wet season, the lower NO3--N pools and rates of net mineralization and net nitrification we measured are indicative of lower pasture N2O fluxes. In general, net nitrification rates exceeded net N mineralization rates as the relatively NH4+-N pools. The interrelationships were investigated in order to understand the major biogeochemical cycles that influence soil fertility under pasture, which is important for devising management technologies that enhance the sustainability of these areas and thus slow further deforestation.

TI  - Forest soil respiration showed a saturation threshold in response to increasing nitrogen deposition: Evidence from a mesocosm experiment
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Whether there is a N saturation threshold for the response of soil respiration (Rs) to increasing nitrogen (N) deposition remains unclear in forest ecosystems. In this work, a simulated N deposition experiment involving five levels of N addition (0 to 44.8 g N m-2 yr-1) was performed in a mesocosm experiment platform with young Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) trees planted on it. Rs and its autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) components were measured for four years, and the N saturation threshold was estimated using a quadratic-plus-plateau model. With increasing rate of N addition, Rs and Ra first increased dramatically until the critical N addition rate of 12.2 and 13.6 g N m-2 yr-1, respectively, and then leveled off. A similar non-linear increase in tree growth was also detected with N addition. In contrast, Rh continued to decrease as N addition increases, primarily a consequence of the N-increased recalcitrance of soil organic C, as evidenced by the decreased gram-negative bacteria biomass coupled with increased polyphenol oxidase activity. Our results indicated (1) that there was a N saturation threshold for the soil respiration, before which respiration rate increased with N addition and such an increase vanished thereafter; and (2) that the N saturation threshold of soil respiration was driven by autotrophic rather than heterotrophic respiration. This study advanced our understanding of the response of forest carbon cycle to growing N deposition.

TI  - Mammal diversity influences the carbon cycle through trophic interactions in the Amazon
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - Biodiversity affects many ecosystem functions and services, including carbon cycling and retention. While it is known that the efficiency of carbon capture and biomass production by ecological communities increases with species diversity, the role of vertebrate animals in the carbon cycle remains undocumented. Here, we use an extensive dataset collected in a high-diversity Amazonian system to parse out the relationship between animal and plant species richness, feeding interactions, tree biomass and carbon concentrations in soil. Mammal and tree species richness is positively related to tree biomass and carbon concentration in soil-and the relationship is mediated by organic remains produced by vertebrate feeding events. Our research advances knowledge of the links between biodiversity and carbon cycling and storage, supporting the view that whole community complexity-including vertebrate richness and trophic interactions-drives ecosystem function in tropical systems. Securing animal and plant diversity while protecting landscape integrity will contribute to soil nutrient content and carbon retention in the biosphere.

TI  - Light grazing reduces the abundance of carbon cycling functional genes by decreasing oligotrophs microbes in desert steppe
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the functional genes of microorganisms involved in carbon cycling processes can link microbial community structure to potential ecological functions. However, the effects of grazing on the relationship between carbon cycling functional genes and soil environment need to be further investigated as a global land use activity. A replicated sheep grazing platform was established in Northern China in 2004 with four different stocking rates: no grazing (0 sheep ha- 1 month- 1), light grazing (0.15 sheep ha- 1 month- 1), moderate grazing (0.30 sheep ha- 1 month- 1), and heavy grazing (0.45 sheep ha- 1 month- 1). To examine the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on microbial species and functional gene abundance, we collected soil samples after 17 years of grazing analyzed for the abundance of microbial communities, the abundance of carbon function genes, plant carbon input and soil environmental factors. We found that light grazing reduced carbon cycling functional genes compared to no grazing (fencing). With increasing grazing intensity, the absolute abundance of functional genes increased. Changes in microbial species abundance were mainly responsible for the changes in the structure of carbon cycling functional genes. Our results emphasize that elucidating how grazing affects the carbon cycling functional genes through the effects of plant carbon inputs and the environment, and the interactions between them, will provide important information for understanding carbon cycling processes in grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Silicon regulates microplastic-induced phytotoxicity and its detoxification mechanism: A plant-microbe perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastics (MP) threaten agricultural ecosystems by altering soil properties and plant-microbe interactions. This study examined polyethylene microplastics (PE-MP) and silicon (Si) effects on kale growth, soil enzymes, and rhizosphere microbiota. PE-MP reduced kale shoot and root biomass by 11 % and 27 %, respectively, and shifted soil properties (e.g., increased pH, decreased potassium). Si increased biomass by 16 % (shoot) and 25 % (root) versus CK and alleviated PE-MP-induced enzyme inhibition. PE-MP suppressed carbon-cycle enzymes (sucrase, S-(3-glucosidase) but enhanced nitrogen-cycle enzymes (urease, N-acetyl-(3-D-glucosidase). Si restored sucrase and boosted alkaline phosphatase activity. PE-MP enriched stress-tolerant Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, while Si promoted beneficial taxa (e.g., Sphingomonas) and mitigated declines in Acidobacteriota and Gemmatimonadota. Co-occurrence networks linked bacterial ASVs to plant physiology, showing Si enhances microbial interactions for nutrient cycling. Si mitigates PE-MP stress via microbial restructuring and enzyme regulation, offering strategies for crop resilience in contaminated soils.

TI  - IMPLICATIONS OF INCREASED CARBON-DIOXIDE LEVELS FOR CARBON INPUT AND TURNOVER IN SOILS
T2  - VEGETATIO
CP  - INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CO2 AND BIOSPHERE
AB  - The complexity of the plant-soil system in its interaction with the changing climate is discussed. It is shown that processes at the level of organic matter inputs into the soil and the fluxes and pools involved in the global cycle are not known in sufficient detail to allow an estimation of the future quantitative shifts. Even the direction in which the level of stored carbon in the soil organic matter pool will develop is not clear. The importance of the nitrogen cycle, which is intimately coupled to the carbon cycle through the turnover of soil organic matter is underlined. In its turn, the mineralisation of soil organic matter takes place at a rate which is highly dependent on the nature of inputs and the availability of mineral nutrients.
   Aspects of shifts in temperature, changes in cultivation practices (reduced tillage) and unintended spreading of inputs in chemical N-fertilizers are of great importance at a regional and global scale.
   The complexity of the interactions in the process of mineralisation do require further studies to clarify the point whether a substantial and durable additional storage of carbon in soil organic matter is likely, or that shifts in temperature will cause an overriding acceleration of the mineralisation, and trigger a corresponding net release of carbon.

TI  - Metagenomic Analyses of Plant Growth-Promoting and Carbon-Cycling Genes in Maize Rhizosphere Soils with Distinct Land-Use and Management Histories
T2  - GENES
AB  - Many studies have shown that the maize rhizosphere comprises several plant growth-promoting microbes, but there is little or no study on the effects of land-use and management histories on microbial functional gene diversity in the maize rhizosphere soils in Africa. Analyzing microbial genes in the rhizosphere of plants, especially those associated with plant growth promotion and carbon cycling, is important for improving soil fertility and crop productivity. Here, we provide a comparative analysis of microbial genes present in the rhizosphere samples of two maize fields with different agricultural histories using shotgun metagenomics. Genes involved in the nutrient mobilization, including nifA, fixJ, norB, pstA, kefA and B, and ktrB were significantly more abundant (alpha = 0.05) in former grassland (F1) rhizosphere soils. Among the carbon-cycling genes, the abundance of 12 genes, including all those involved in the degradation of methane were more significant (alpha = 0.05) in the F1 soils, whereas only five genes were significantly more abundant in the F2 soils. alpha-diversity indices were different across the samples and significant differences were observed in the beta diversity of plant growth-promoting and carbon-cycling genes between the fields (ANOSIM, p = 0.01 and R = 0.52). Nitrate-nitrogen (N-NO3) was the most influential physicochemical parameter (p = 0.05 and contribution = 31.3%) that affected the distribution of the functional genes across the samples. The results indicate that land-use and management histories impact the composition and diversity of plant growth-promoting and carbon-cycling genes in the plant rhizosphere. The study widens our understanding of the effects of anthropogenic activities on plant health and major biogeochemical processes in soils.

TI  - Effects of microplastics on microbial community and greenhouse gas emission in soil: A critical review
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in soil ecosystems and significantly impact soil microorganisms and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although some reviews have summarized their impact on greenhouse gas emissions, no systematic analysis has been conducted on how soil physicochemical and microbial properties affect these emissions. Firstly, this review details that MPs alter microbial abundance, structure, activity and gene expression, directly stimulating CO2 and N2O emissions, though their impact on CH4 remains inconclusive. Additionally, MPs change rhizosphere microbial growth, cause soil nutrient loss, and induce plant toxicity, indirectly affecting GHG emissions. Finally, this article suggests strengthening research on rhizosphere and MPs surface microbial communities, exploring interactions with clay and minerals, and investigating GHG emission mechanisms to understand the ecological effects of MPs.

TI  - The Nitrogen Cycling Key Functional Genes and Related Microbial Bacterial Community α-Diversity Is Determined by Crop Rotation Plans in the Loess Plateau
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Soil nitrogen cycling microbial communities and functional gene & alpha;-diversity indicate soil nitrogen cycling ecological functions and potentials. Crop rotation plans affect soil nitrogen fractions and these indicators. We sequenced soil samples from four crop rotation plans (fallow, winter wheat monoculture, pea-winter wheat-winter wheat-millet rotation, and corn-wheat-wheat-millet rotation) in a long-term field experiment. We examined how microbial communities and functional gene & alpha;-diversity changed with soil nitrogen fractions and how nitrogen fractions regulated them. Planting crops increased the abundance and richness of nitrogen cycling key functional genes and bacterial communities compared with fallow. The abundance and richness correlated positively with nitrogen fractions, while Shannon index did not. The abundance increased with soil total nitrogen (STN) and potential nitrogen mineralization (PNM), while Shannon index showed that nitrogen cycling key functional genes increased and then decreased with increasing STN and PON. Introducing legumes into the rotation improved the & alpha;-diversity of nitrogen cycling key functional genes. These results can guide sustainable agriculture in the Loess Plateau and clarify the relationship between nitrogen fractions and nitrogen cycling key functional genes.

TI  - Effects of pharmaceuticals on the nitrogen cycle in water and soil: a review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
AB  - The effects of pharmaceuticals on the nitrogen cycle in water and soil have recently become an increasingly important issue for environmental research. However, a few studies have investigated the direct effects of pharmaceuticals on the nitrogen cycle in water and soil. Pharmaceuticals can contribute to inhibition and stimulation of nitrogen cycle processes in the environment. Some pharmaceuticals have no observable effect on the nitrogen cycle in water and soil while others appeared to inhibit or stimulate for it. This review reports on the most recent evidence of effects of pharmaceuticals on the nitrogen cycle processes by examination of the potential impact of pharmaceuticals on nitrogen fixation, nitrification, ammonification, denitrification, and anammox. Research studies have identified pharmaceuticals that can either inhibit or stimulate nitrification, ammonification, denitrification, and anammox. Among these, amoxicillin, chlortetracycline, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, narasin, norfloxacin, and sulfamethazine had the most significant effects on nitrogen cycle processes. This review also clearly demonstrates that some nitrogen transformation processes such as nitrification show much higher sensitivity to the presence of pharmaceuticals than other nitrogen transformations or flows such as mineralization or ammonia volatilization. We conclude by suggesting that future studies take a more comprehensive approach to report on pharmaceuticals' impact on the nitrogen cycle process.

TI  - Summer warming accelerates sub-arctic peatland nitrogen cycling without changing enzyme pools or microbial community structure
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The balance of primary production and decomposition in northern peatlands may shift due to climate change, with potential feedbacks to atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Nitrogen availability will modulate this shift, but little is known about the drivers of soil nitrogen dynamics in these environments. We used a long-term (9 years) open top chamber (OTC) experiment in an ombrotrophic Sphagnum peat bog in sub-arctic Sweden, to test for the interactive effects of spring warming, summer warming and winter snow addition on soil nitrogen fluxes, potential activities of nitrogen cycle enzymes, and soil microbial community composition. These simultaneous measurements allowed us to identify the level of organization at which climate change impacts are apparent, an important requirement for developing truly mechanistic understanding. Organic-N pools and fluxes were an order of magnitude higher than inorganic-N pools and fluxes. Summer warming approximately doubled fluxes of soil organic nitrogen and ammonia over the growing season. Such a large increase under 1 degrees C warming is unlikely to be due to kinetic effects, and we propose that it is linked to an observed seasonal decrease in microbial biomass, suggesting that N flux is driven by a substantial late-season dieback of microbes. This change in N cycle dynamics was not reflected in any of the measured potential peptidase activities. Moreover, the soil microbial community structure was apparently stable across treatments, suggesting a non-specific microbial dieback. Our results show that in these widespread peat bogs, where many plant species are capable of organic-N uptake, organic soil N dynamics are quantitatively far more important than the commonly studied inorganic-N dynamics. Understanding of climate change effects on organic soil N cycling in this system will be advanced by closer investigation of the seasonal dynamics of the microbial biomass and the input of substrates that maintain it.

TI  - Spatial distribution and interactions of microbial communities producing resuscitation promoting factors and driving carbon cycling in reservoir sediment ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Water reservoir sediments host diverse microbial communities that play pivotal roles in carbon cycling. However, a substantial fraction of environmental microbes persists in a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state. The discovery of resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs) has advanced understanding of VBNC reactivation, offering promising strategies to restore microbial metabolic activity and ecological functions. Rpf-like genes, responsible for encoding Rpfs, are found in diverse environments and play a crucial role in the resuscitation and functional recovery of microbes in the VBNC state. Despite their ecological importance, the interactions between microorganisms harboring rpf-like genes and carbon-cycling functional groups remain poorly understood. This study investigated the distribution of rpf-like genes and carbon cycle-related genes in reservoir sediments and examined the correlations between carbon cycle-related genes and environmental variables. Co-occurrence patterns among rpf-like genes, carbon cycle-related genes, and VBNC formation genes were also analyzed. The results revealed that rpf-like genes were predominantly associated with genera such as Bradyrhizobium, Anaeromyxobacter, and Nitrospira, which collectively exhibited the highest overall abundance of carbon cycle-related genes, particularly those involved in organic carbon degradation. The distribution of carbon-cycling microorganisms was primarily positively influenced by NH4+ concentrations. Co-occurrence network analysis demonstrated strong positive correlations between microorganisms harboring rpf-like genes and those involved in carbon cycling and the VBNC state. These findings highlight the ecological significance of rpf-like genes in reservoir sediments and their interactions with microbial communities that drive carbon cycling, revealing the potential for microbial-driven carbon cycling in reservoir ecosystems.

TI  - Towards an integrated view on microbial CH4, N2O and N2 cycles in brackish coastal marsh soils: A comparative analysis of two sites
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Coastal ecosystems, facing threats from global change and human activities like excessive nutrients, undergo alterations impacting their function and appearance. This study explores the intertwined microbial cycles of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), encompassing methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitrogen gas (N2) fluxes, to determine nutrient transformation processes between the soil -plant -atmosphere continuum in the coastal ecosystems with brackish water. Water salinity negatively impacted denitrification, bacterial nitrification, N fixation, and n-DAMO processes, but did not significantly affect archaeal nitrification, COMAMMOX, DNRA, and ANAMMOX processes in the N cycle. Plant species age and biomass influenced CH4 and N2O emissions. The highest CH4 emissions were from old Spartina and mixed Spartina and Scirpus sites, while Phragmites sites emitted the most N2O. Nitrification and incomplete denitrification mainly governed N2O emissions depending on the environmental conditions and plants. The higher genetic potential of ANAMMOX reduced excessive N by converting it to N2 in the sites with higher average temperatures. The presence of plants led to a decrease in the N fixers' abundance. Plant biomass negatively affected methanogenetic mcrA genes. Microbes involved in n-DAMO processes helped mitigate CH4 emissions. Over 93 % of the total climate forcing came from CH4 emissions, except for the Chinese bare site where the climate forcing was negative, and for Phragmites sites, where almost 60 % of the climate forcing came from N2O emissions. Our findings indicate that nutrient cycles, CH4, and N2O fluxes in soils are context -dependent and influenced by environmental factors and vegetation. This underscores the need for empirical analysis of both C and N cycles at various levels (soil -plant -atmosphere) to understand how habitats or plants affect nutrient cycles and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Unveiling the role of the freshwater aquaculture industry in the contribution of greenhouse gas (CO2 and CH4) emissions of tropical India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - The aquaculture industries enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, causing global carbon cycle alteration and global warming (GW). CH4 and CO2 are two major GHGs responsible for GW, whereas CH4 is the foremost GHG with a higher sustained global warming potential (GWP). Herein, the emissions of GHGs (especially CH4 and CO2) from the freshwater aquaculture and non-aquaculture ponds of tropical India have been investigated using the floating gas chamber method (chamber volume 0.0298 m(3) and surface area 0.138 m(2)). The samples were collected in the month of April 2024 using a spatial distribution technique and analyzed using gas chromatography. The average emissions of CH4 and CO2 were 281.43 and 88.41 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) for aquaculture ponds and 12.44 and 5.22 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) for non-aquaculture ponds, respectively. Water quality, soil/sediment, fish stock density, fish feed, organic matter (chlorophyll-a), etc., of different sample sites influence the emissions of GHGs. The GHGs formation mechanism from various organic matters is established using the methanogenesis pathway. Around 32 % (2010-2020) of agriculture/vegetation lands have been converted into the aquaculture industry, which influenced the GHGs emissions in the study area. GWP for CH4 and CO2 was 292.95 and 3.41 kg m(-2) CO2-eq annually on a 100-year scale, respectively, i.e., similar to 85.91 times that of CO2, depicting that random construction of aquaculture ponds and abolition of vegetation cover might influence the natural carbon cycling affecting Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate action).

TI  - Functional Distribution of Bacterial Community under Different Land Use Patterns Based on FaProTax Function Prediction
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB  - Soil microorganisms play an important role in biogeochemical cycling. The bacterial community functional community profiles across different land use types in the mountainous region of eastern Liaoning Province, China, such as natural secondary forest (Quercus mongolica (QM)), shrub wood (SW), coniferous planation (Larix gmelini (LG), and Pinus koraiensis ( PK)), and agricultural land (Zea mays (ZM)) were evaluated using high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene, and predicted based on the FaProTax database. Bacterial functional groups varied across samples under different land use patterns. A total of 53 functional groups were acquired using FaProTaxin accordance with the classification annotation results of 16S rDNA sequences. These functional groups contained 5809 OTUs, accounting for 66.25% of all OTUs. The dominant functions were chemoheterotrophs and aerobicchemoheterotrophy with average relative abundance of 21.69% and 21.01%, respectively. In addition, we detected 15 and 12 ecological function groups related to the carbon and nitrogen cycles, respectively. The bacterial functional groups of ZM were clearly separated from those of PK, LG, QM, and SW, indicating that functional groups of agriculture soil differed from those of forest soils. Furthermore, the bacterial functional groups of LG and PK were obviously separated from those of QM and SW, suggesting that functional groups of broad leaf forest differed from those of coniferous forests. Also, we analyzed the main factors that influence soil bacterial community functional groups under different land use patterns. It was found that soil environmental conditions, especially soil pH, NH4+-N, and NO3--N content,and strongly influenced the distribution of functional groups about carbon and nitrogen cycles in bacterial communities. It is of great significance to provide a scientific basis for the sustainable utilization of soil in northeastern China.

TI  - Magnesium application partially reversed the negative effects of mulching on rhizosphere nitrogen cycling in a Phyllostachys praecox forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Mulching is the practice of covering soil with a layer of organic or inorganic material. While this process is often used in bamboo forests to increase yield, it has also been found to lead to bamboo degradation, especially in Phyllostachys praecox (Lei-bamboo) forests. Studies suggest that mulching might accelerate degradation by altering rhizosphere nitrogen cycling, a process likely influenced by the depletion of soil calcium and magnesium. However, the specific changes to rhizosphere nitrogen cycling under mulching and its relationship with calcium and magnesium remain unclear. To address this, our study investigated rhizosphere nitrogen cycling in Lei-bamboo across a short-term degradation cycle. We found that mulching enhanced the abundance of 16S-rRNA and nitrogen-cycling functional genes. Correspondingly, it also significantly enhanced soil respiration and nitrogen-cycling functional potentials, leading to ammonium accumulation but nitrate depletion. The rhizosphere nitrogen-cycling network reorganized as the relative contributions of gdhA, AOB-amoA, napA, nirK, and nosZ increased. Surprisingly, nitrite accumulated under mulching due to a decrease in the nxrA/AOB ratio. Although total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and pH were the main drivers of nitrogen cycling variation, magnesium also exerted considerable influence. Subsequent field amendment experiments confirmed that magnesium was the most limited nutrient under mulching. Magnesium supplementation further elevated rhizosphere microbial biomass and nitrogen-cycling functional potential, which calcium did not. The composition indicators of nitrogen-cycling groups, such as nxrA/AOB, as well as the content of ammonia and nitrite, reverted toward their original states after magnesium application, but the nitrate further reduced. Our findings suggest that magnesium application can partially counteract the negative effects of mulching on the rhizosphere nitrogen cycle. We discovered that nitrification processes and nxrA were more sensitive to magnesium than other nitrogen-cycling processes and functional genes, indicating they could be key sites where magnesium regulates nitrogen cycling. This research provides a new idea for the biogeochemical coupling of magnesium and nitrogen and offers useful guidance for sustainable mulching in Lei-bamboo agriculture.

TI  - The hidden nitrogen nexus: stochastic assembly and linear gene synergies drive urban park microbial networks
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Urban parks play a significant role in environmental greening, cultural heritage, and recreational activities. The diversity and distribution of park environmental microbiota have become a hot focus of microbial ecology. However, there has been limited attention on the functional attributes of microbial communities, highlighting the importance of studying the distribution and diversity of functional genes in urban parks. Here, we employed metagenomic sequencing and binning to explore the diversity, assembly, and functional synergy of nitrogen cycling genes from the grassland soil and water in urban parks. Our results showed that glutamate metabolism and assimilatory nitrate reduction are the predominant nitrogen cycling pathways in both the soil and water. The diversity of nitrogen cycling genes in water was more abundant than in soil. The assembly of nitrogen cycling genes in both the soil and water was primarily driven by stochastic processes. Nutrient factors (such as total sulfur) were the most significant influencers of nitrogen cycling genes in park soil, while bacterial communities were the most critical determinants in water. The gene narH, involved in multiple nitrogen cycling metabolic pathways, was identified as an important marker of nitrogen storage in both soil and water. Through metagenomic binning, we discovered linear arrangements of multiple nitrogen cycling genes, such as narG-narH-narJ-narI, which collectively participate in the reduction of nitrate to nitrite, demonstrating the synergy, functional redundancy, and complementarity among nitrogen cycling genes. Our study holds significant implications for the biochemical cycling and the management of nitrogen pollution in urban parks.

TI  - Reviews and syntheses: Soil responses to manipulated precipitation changes - an assessment of meta-analyses
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - In the face of ongoing and projected climatic changes, precipitation manipulation experiments (PMEs) have produced a wealth of data about the effects of precipitation changes on soils. In response, researchers have undertaken a number of synthetic efforts. Several meta-analyses have been conducted, each revealing new aspects of soil responses to precipitation changes. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of the findings of 16 meta-analyses focused on the effects of precipitation changes on 42 soil response variables, covering a wide range of soil processes. We examine responses of individual variables as well as more integrative responses of carbon and nitrogen cycles. We find strong agreement among meta-analyses that belowground carbon and nitrogen cycling accelerate under increased precipitation and slow under decreased precipitation, while bacterial and fungal communities are relatively resistant to decreased precipitation. Much attention has been paid to fluxes and pools in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles, such as gas emissions, soil carbon, soil phosphorus, extractable nitrogen ions, and biomass. The rates of processes underlying these variables (e.g., mineralization, fixation, and (de)nitrification) are less frequently covered in meta-analytic studies, with the major exception of respiration rates. Shifting scientific attention to these less broadly evaluated processes would deepen the current understanding of the effects of precipitation changes on soil and provide new insights. By jointly evaluating meta- analyses focused on a wide range of variables, we provide here a holistic view of soil responses to changes in precipitation.

TI  - Mechanisms of plant species impacts on ecosystem nitrogen cycling
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Plant species are hypothesized to impact ecosystem nitrogen cycling in two distinctly different ways. First, differences in nitrogen use efficiency can lead to positive feedbacks on the rate of nitrogen cycling. Alternatively, plant species can also control the inputs and losses of nitrogen from ecosystems.
   Our current understanding of litter decomposition shows that most nitrogen present within litter is not released during decomposition but incorporated into soil organic matter. This nitrogen retention is caused by an increase in the relative nitrogen content in decomposing litter and a much lower carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of soil organic matter. The long time lag between plant litter formation and the actual release of nitrogen from the litter results in a bottleneck, which prevents feedbacks of plant quality differences on nitrogen cycling. Instead, rates of gross nitrogen mineralization, which are often an order of magnitude higher than net mineralization, indicate that nitrogen cycling within ecosystems is dominated by a microbial nitrogen loop. Nitrogen is released from the soil organic matter and incorporated into microbial biomass. Upon their death, the nitrogen is again incorporated into the soil organic matter. However, this microbial nitrogen loop is driven by plant-supplied carbon and provides a strong negative feedback through nitrogen cycling on plant productivity. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is strong for temperate grassland ecosystems. For other terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests, tropical and boreal regions, the data are much more limited. Thus, current evidence does not support the view that differences in the efficiency of plant nitrogen use lead to positive feedbacks. In contrast, soil microbes are the dominant factor structuring ecosystem nitrogen cycling. Soil microbes derive nitrogen from the decomposition of soil organic matter, but this microbial activity is driven by recent plant carbon inputs. Changes in plant carbon inputs, resulting from plant species shifts, lead to a negative feedback through microbial nitrogen immobilization.
   In contrast, there is abundant evidence that plant species impact nitrogen inputs and losses, such as: atmospheric deposition, fire-induced losses, nitrogen leaching, and nitrogen fixation, which is driven by carbon supply from plants to nitrogen fixers. Additionally, plants can influence the activity and composition of soil microbial communities, which has the potential to lead to differences in nitrification, denitrification and trace nitrogen gas losses. Plant species also impact herbivore behaviour and thereby have the potential to lead to animal-facilitated movement of nitrogen between ecosystems.
   Thus, current evidence supports the view that plant species can have large impacts on ecosystem nitrogen cycling. However, species impacts are not caused by differences in plant quantity and quality, but by plant species impacts on nitrogen inputs and losses.

TI  - Linking N2O emissions from biochar-amended soil to the structure and function of the N-cycling microbial community
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) contributes 8% to global greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural sources represent about 60% of anthropogenic N2O emissions. Most agricultural N2O emissions are due to increased fertilizer application. A considerable fraction of nitrogen fertilizers are converted to N2O by microbiological processes (that is, nitrification and denitrification). Soil amended with biochar (charcoal created by pyrolysis of biomass) has been demonstrated to increase crop yield, improve soil quality and affect greenhouse gas emissions, for example, reduce N2O emissions. Despite several studies on variations in the general microbial community structure due to soil biochar amendment, hitherto the specific role of the nitrogen cycling microbial community in mitigating soil N2O emissions has not been subject of systematic investigation. We performed a microcosm study with a water-saturated soil amended with different amounts (0%, 2% and 10% (w/w)) of high-temperature biochar. By quantifying the abundance and activity of functional marker genes of microbial nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrification (amoA) and denitrification (nirK, nirS and nosZ) using quantitative PCR we found that biochar addition enhanced microbial nitrous oxide reduction and increased the abundance of microorganisms capable of N-2-fixation. Soil biochar amendment increased the relative gene and transcript copy numbers of the nosZ-encoded bacterial N2O reductase, suggesting a mechanistic link to the observed reduction in N2O emissions. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of biochar on the nitrogen cycling microbial community and the consequences of soil biochar amendment for microbial nitrogen transformation processes and N2O emissions from soil.

TI  - Functional and taxonomic biogeographical patterns of carbon-cycling microbial communities in farmland ecosystems of Shaanxi Province, China
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Despite the critical role of microorganisms in soil carbon cycling, studies on the biogeography and assembly of carbon cycling functional traits and taxonomic groups in farmland ecosystems remain limited. Here, we collected soil from typical crop-growing areas in Shaanxi Province, China, including rapeseed (southern Shaanxi), wheat (Guanzhong area), and potato (northern Shaanxi) fields, to explore the distribution, assembly, and influencing factors of soil carbon-cycling microbial communities in farmland ecosystems. Distance-decay relationships were observed for both functional traits and taxonomic groups. Latitudinal diversity gradients were prominent for taxonomic groups but scarce for functional traits. The effects of environmental variables on functional and taxonomic community composition were slightly more influential than those of geographic distance. Functional traits and taxonomic groups are shaped by the same set of environmental factors, primarily mean annual temperature and precipitation, and soil pH. Neutral community and null model analyses demonstrated that stochastic processes predominantly governed the assembly of functional and taxonomic communities. Mean annual precipitation, functional trait composition, and microbial community composition also prominently affected the assembly of functional and taxonomic communities. Untargeted metabolomics identified strong associations between key carbon-cycling microbial taxa (e.g., Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Gemmatimonadetes) and soil metabolite accumulation, including positive correlations with lipids, saccharides, and alcohols. The results broaden our understanding of microbially-driven soil carbon cycling. The findings underscore the need to consider both functional and taxonomic dimensions when managing soil microbiome-mediated carbon sequestration in agroecosystems.

TI  - Unraveling environmental drivers of a recent increase in Swiss fungi fruiting
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Disentangling biotic and abiotic drivers of wild mushroom fruiting is fraught with difficulties because mycelial growth is hidden belowground, symbiotic and saprotrophic supply strategies may interact, and myco-ecological observations are often either discontinuous or too short. Here, we compiled and analyzed 115417 weekly fungal fruit body counts from permanent Swiss inventories between 1975 and 2006. Mushroom fruiting exhibited an average autumnal delay of 12days after 1991 compared with before, the annual number of fruit bodies increased from 1801 to 5414 and the mean species richness doubled from 10 to 20. Intra- and interannual coherency of symbiotic and saprotrophic mushroom fruiting, together with little agreement between mycorrhizal yield and tree growth suggests direct climate controls on fruit body formation of both nutritional modes. Our results contradict a previously reported declining of mushroom harvests and propose rethinking the conceptual role of symbiotic pathways in fungi-host interaction. Moreover, this conceptual advancement may foster new cross-disciplinary research avenues, and stimulate questions about possible amplifications of the global carbon cycle, as enhanced fungal production in moist mid-latitude forests rises carbon cycling and thus increases greenhouse gas exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.

TI  - Widespread production of nonmicrobial greenhouse gases in soils
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the three most important greenhouse gases (GHGs), and all show large uncertainties in their atmospheric budgets. Soils of natural and managed ecosystems play an extremely important role in modulating their atmospheric abundance. Mechanisms underlying the exchange of these GHGs at the soil-atmosphere interface are often assumed to be exclusively microbe-mediated (M-GHGs). We argue that it is a widespread phenomenon for soil systems to produce GHGs through nonmicrobial pathways (NM-GHGs) based on a review of the available evidence accumulated over the past half century. We find that five categories of mechanistic process, including photodegradation, thermal degradation, reactive oxidative species (ROS) oxidation, extracellular oxidative metabolism (EXOMET), and inorganic chemical reactions, can be identified as accounting for their production. These pathways are intricately coupled among themselves and with M-GHGs production and are subject to strong influences from regional and global change agents including, among others, climate warming, solar radiation, and alterations of atmospheric components. Preliminary estimates have suggested that NM-GHGs could play key roles in contributing to budgets of GHGs in the arid regions, whereas their global importance would be enhanced with accelerated global environmental changes. Therefore, more research should be undertaken, with a differentiation between NM-GHGs and M-GHGs, to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, to investigate the impacts of various global change agents, and to quantify their contributions to regional and global GHGs budgets. These efforts will contribute to a more complete understanding of global carbon and nitrogen cycling and a reduction in the uncertainty of carbon-climate feedbacks in the Earth system.

TI  - Effects of long-term application of chemical and organic fertilizers on the abundance of microbial communities involved in the nitrogen cycle
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Long-term agricultural fertilization significantly affects nitrogen cycling in soils. However, there is little information about the response of different functional genes involved in the nitrogen cycle to chemical and organic fertilization, and the key factor influencing the community abundance. We investigated the influence of long-term application of chemical fertilizer (NPK) and combined with wheat straw or livestock manures on the abundance of six nitrogen cycle genes (nifH, archaeal and bacterial amoA, nirS, nirK and nosZ) by quantitative PCR. Compared with non-fertilization treatment, long-term application of NPK fertilizers significantly increased the abundance of nirK, nosZ and bacterial amoA genes but decreased archaeal amoA gene abundance, with no significant effect on the abundance of nifH and nirS genes. Compared with NPK treatment, the application of NPK + organic manure increased the abundance of all the nitrogen-cycling genes while the application of NPK + wheat straw had little effect. The abundance of amoA genes contributed the most to the variations in the abundance of the nitrogen cycling community between different fertilization strategies. Soil available P and total N were the most important factors influencing the abundance of microbial communities involved in the nitrogen cycle. These results indicated that, under the application of chemical fertilizers, the addition of livestock manures had much stronger effects on the abundance of nitrogen cycle genes than the addition of wheat straw, and bacterial and archaeal amoA genes were more sensitive to fertilization than other functional genes.

TI  - Herbivores influence biogeochemical processes by altering litter quality and quantity in a subarctic wetland
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Global change drivers that modify the quality and quantity of litter inputs to soil affect greenhouse gas fluxes, and thereby constitute a feedback to climate change. Carbon cycling in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) River Delta, a subarctic wetland system, is influenced by landscape variations in litter quality and quantity generated by herbivores (migratory birds) that create 'grazing lawns' of short stature, nitrogen-rich vegetation. To identify the mechanisms by which these changes in litter inputs affect soil carbon balance, we independently manipulated qualities and quantities of litter representative of levels found in the Y-K Delta in a fully factorial microcosm experiment. We measured CO2 fluxes from these microcosms weekly. To help us identify how litter inputs influenced greenhouse gas fluxes, we sequenced soil fungal and bacterial communities, and measured soil microbial biomass carbon, dissolved carbon, inorganic nitrogen, and enzyme activity. We found that positive correlations between litter input quantity and CO2 flux were dependent upon litter type, due to differences in litter stoichiometry and changes to the structure of decomposer communities, especially the soil fungi. These community shifts were particularly pronounced when litter was added in the form of herbivore feces, and in litter input treatments that induced nitrogen limitation (i.e., senesced litter). The sensitivity of carbon cycling to litter quality and quantity in this system demonstrates that herbivores can strongly impact greenhouse gas fluxes through their influence on plant growth and tissue chemistry.

TI  - Nitrogen cycle pattern variations during seawater-groundwater-river interactions enhance the nitrogen availability in the coastal earth critical zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - Hydrological interaction in highly vital and productive coastal earth critical zone (CECZ) significantly impacts the nitrogen cycle and availability, which is the essential foundation for agricultural production. The results of isotopes and microbial sequencing showed that nitrogen fixation and nitrite oxidation are enhanced in the palaeo-saltwater intrusion process. The weakening AmoCAB and Hao impedes the normal nitrogen cycling pathway, promoting the input of organic nitrogen, thus increasing nitrogen availability flux. In the river into the sea, nitrogen fixation is enhanced, while nitrite oxidation, denitrification, and DNRA are weakened. The whole intensity of the nitrogen cycle decreases. In addition, the oxidation of NH4-N to NO2-N in this process is inaccessible, which means that the nitrogen cycle flux is substantially reduced. In the river recharge to groundwater, nitrite oxidation, nitrogen fixation, and ammonia oxidation are enhanced. In the submarine groundwater discharge, the whole intensity of the nitrogen cycle gradually weakens and the nitrogen cycle flux greatly reduces. As the final pool of coastal groundwater and surface water, the significant reduction of the nitrogen cycle intensity and the absence of the pathway link allows nitrogen in seawater to flow out of the inorganic nitrogen cycle by the conversion to organic nitrogen, thus the net flux of nitrogen availability trapped in the hydrological systems increases. The hydrological interaction enhances the breadth of nitrogen sources, the diversity of pathways, and the flux of nitrogen in CECZ, thereby promoting more nitrogen being trapped in system and increasing nitrogen availability.

TI  - The mechanism of plants and effective microorganisms combined remediation of heavily TNT-contaminated soil
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
AB  - High concentrations of energetic compounds in soil pose a serious threat to the ecology and human health. In this study, a combination of plant-microbe remediation was used to remediate soil contaminated with high TNT concentrations. This study aimed to reveal the remediation efficiency, metabolic potential, and microbial community structure in high-concentration TNT-contaminated soils following combined remediation. Five plants and microorganisms were combined to remediate soil contaminated with high concentrations of TNT (1434 mg/ kg). The TNT residues in the soil were only 69-125 mg/kg after 60 days. The combined plant-microbe remediation enhanced the soil nitrogen cycle, carbon cycle, and phosphorus metabolism. Untargeted metabolome gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the combined remediation restored fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism pathways in TNT-contaminated soil. Subsequent 16S rRNA diversity analysis showed that the combined microbial agents occupied soil ecological niches. Interaction network analysis showed that phytomicrobial remediation improved the rate of recovery of TNT-contaminated soil by reshaping the microbial structure and metabolic cycles.

TI  - Exploring the distribution and co-occurrence of rpf-like genes and nitrogen-cycling genes in water reservoir sediments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Water reservoir sediments represent a distinct habitat that harbors diverse microbial resources crucial for nitrogen cycling processes. The discovery of resuscitation promoting factor (Rpf) has been recognized as a crucial development in understanding the potential of microbial populations. However, our understanding of the relationship between microorganisms containing rpf-like genes and nitrogen-cycling functional populations remains limited. The present study explored the distribution patterns of rpf-like genes and nitrogen-cycling genes in various water reservoir sediments, along with their correlation with environmental factors. Additionally, the co-occurrence of rpf-like genes with genes associated with the nitrogen cycle and viable but non-culturable (VBNC) formation was investigated. The findings indicated the ubiquitous occurrence of Rpf-like domains and their related genes in the examined reservoir sediments. Notably, rpf-like genes were predominantly associated with Bradyrhizobium, Nitrospira, and Anaeromyxobacter, with pH emerging as the primary influencing factor for their distribution. Genera such as Nitrospira, Bradyrhizobium, Anaeromyxobacter, and Dechloromonas harbor the majority of nitrogen-cycling functional genes, particularly denitrification genes. The distribution of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities in the reservoir sediments was mainly influenced by pH and NH4+. Notably, correlation network analysis revealed close connections between microorganisms containing rpf-like genes and nitrogen-cycling functional populations, as well as VBNC bacteria. These findings offer new insights into the prevalence of rpf-like genes in the water reservoir sediments and their correlation with nitrogen-cycling microbial communities, enhancing our understanding of the significant potential of microbial nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Metagenomics reveals the effects of long-term greenhouse vegetable cultivation on soil microbial communities and carbon cycle functions
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsSoil microbial community structure and diversity are critical for maintaining the health of soil ecosystems. However, how soil microbes regulate the soil carbon cycle under long-term greenhouse cultivation remains unclear.MethodsWe used macro-genomics to analyze changes in microbial community structure and diversity as well as carbon cycle-related functional genes in a long-term greenhouse-grown soil.ResultsLong-term greenhouse cultivation significantly altered soil microbial community structure, manifested by decreased bacterial diversity and increased fungal diversity. The rTCA cycle served as the dominant carbon fixation pathway, with microbial carbon fixation capacity markedly reduced during the initial greenhouse phase but gradually restored as cultivation duration extended. Prolonged greenhouse practices elevated the abundance of degradation genes for labile carbon (i.e. starch) while suppressing those for recalcitrant carbon (i.e. cellulose and lignin). Soil pH is the primary driver of changes in microbial community structure and shifts in carbon cycling functional genes.ConclusionsLong-term greenhouse cultivation reshaped the microbial community structure by altering soil properties, thereby driving adaptive shifts in microbial carbon cycling functions. The findings provide new insights into the microbial mechanisms underlying soil carbon cycling in long-term greenhouse vegetable cultivation.

TI  - Stabilities of soil organic carbon and carbon cycling genes are higher in natural secondary forests than in artificial plantations in southern China
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Our understanding of how reforestation affects microbial carbon cycling genes remains limited, restricting our ability to evaluate reforestation methods. We hypothesized that natural reforestation produces soil organic carbon (SOC) with significantly more complex chemical composition and more diverse carbon cycling genes than artificial restoration. The SOC fractions and carbon cycling (primarily fixation and degradation) genes present in natural restoration/regrowth (natural secondary forests), and artificial restoration (Masson and slash pine plantations) were compared. The SOC in natural secondary forests was significantly more abundant and structurally more complex than that of Masson and slash pine plantations. The natural secondary forest soils contained significantly more abundant and diverse carbon cycling genes than plantations. Plant-, soil-, and nutrient-associated factors explained 42.1% of the variation in microbial carbon cycling gene compositions. These factors included tree diversity, fine root surface area, litter stock, clay and silt, labile and recalcitrant organic carbon, available nitrogen and nitrate-nitrogen contents. These factors affect the microbial carbon cycling gene diversity but not abundance in the natural secondary forest soils. These genes' abundance and diversity in the Masson and slash pine plantation soils were enriched by increasing litter stock and decreasing clay and silt contents; they were also enhanced by higher tree diversity, labile and recalcitrant organic carbon, available nitrogen, and nitrate-nitrogen contents. These findings indicate that current reforestation methods affect carbon cycling genes, carbon cycling potential, and thus, biogeochemical carbon cycling processes. Natural restoration is better than artificial restoration in terms of organic carbon stability and cycling.

TI  - Metagenomic insights into carbon and nitrogen cycling in the water-land transition zone of inland alkaline wetlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Inland alkaline wetlands play a crucial role in maintaining ecological functions. However, these wetlands are becoming more vulnerable to the effects of water level fluctuations caused by global climate change, especially concerning carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Here, metagenomics sequencing was used to investigate microorganism diversity, C and N cycling gene abundance at three water level types (D (dry), MF (middle flooded), HF (high flooded)) along an inland alkaline wetland. Our findings reveal that water level was the most important factor in regulating the microbial communities. Distinct shifts in community composition were found along the water level increases, without fundamentally altering their composition. With the increase of water level, the relative abundance of pmoA decreased from 2.5 x 10-5-5 to 5.1 x 10-6.-6 . The C cycling processes shift from predominantly CO2-generated 2-generated processes under low water levels to CO2 2 and CH4 4 co-generated processes under high water levels. The relative abundance of nosZ reached 4.9 x 10-5-5 in HF, while in D and MF, it is recorded at 4.5 x 10-5-5 and 3.4 x 10-5,-5 , respectively. Water levels accelerate N cycling and generating N2O 2 O intermediates. Furthermore, our study highlights the dynamic competition and cooperation between C and N cycling processes. This research provides a comprehensive biological understanding of the influence of varying water levels on soil C and N cycling processes in wetland.

TI  - Spatiotemporal diversification enables sustainable cotton-soybean production with enhanced yield and reduced emissions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Conventional monoculture and static intercropping systems exacerbate soil degradation, greenhouse gas emissions, and yield stagnation, failing to reconcile productivity with environmental sustainability. To address these challenges, we developed a novel alternate strip intercropping (ASI) system that integrates annual row-swapping between cotton and soybean, leveraging spatiotemporal diversification to optimize resource use and soil functionality. Through a six-year field experiment in the North China Plain, we tested the hypothesis that ASI enhances productivity, soil health, and nitrogen cycling efficiency while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to monoculture, ASI increased cotton and soybean yields by 28 % and 21 %, respectively, achieving a land equivalent ratio of 1.26-surpassing traditional intercropping (1.13)-through improved light, water, and nutrient partitioning. Soil organic carbon rose by 21 %, driven by microbial restructuring (e.g., 83-87 % higher arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization), which enhanced aggregate stability and nutrient retention. Critically, ASI reduced cumulative N2O emissions by 18-23 % (cotton) and 6-11 % (soybean) via optimized nitrogen cycling and microbial suppression of denitrification, decoupling yield gains from emission intensity. Economic returns increased by 24-122 % over conventional systems. Multidimensional sustainability indices, integrating agronomic, ecological, and socioeconomic metrics, revealed 40-188 % improvements under ASI compared to conventional practices. These outcomes were driven by complementary root architectures and rhizosphere interactions that fostered carbon sequestration and nitrogen use efficiency. This system supports Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger) and 13 (Climate Action) by demonstrating a pathway toward climate-resilient agroecosystem. Within the studied temperate environment, ASI reconciles yield-environment tradeoffs, suggesting a scalable approach for cleaner production in similar agroecosystems.

TI  - Impacts of aboveground litter and belowground roots on soil greenhouse gas emissions: Evidence from a DIRT experiment in a pine plantation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Plant detritus alteration may influence soil greenhouse gas emissions, but the direction, extent and mechanisms remain uncertain. Here we conducted a DIRT (Detritus Input and Removal Treatment) experiment in a Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica plantation in Saihanba (Hebei Province, China), manipulating aboveground litter (L-: litter removal, L: normal litter, L+: litter doubling) and belowground roots (R-: root removal, R: with root) resulting in six treatments. We measured CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes during 2019 and 2020 growing seasons, along with soil physicochemical, enzymatic and microbial variables. Our findings revealed that soil CO2 and N2O emissions increased with litter input, while CH4 uptake decreased. The absence of roots decreased soil CO2 emission and CH4 uptake but increased N2O emission. Aboveground litter enhanced the carbon cycling variables, such as extractable organic carbon (EOC), the ratio of soil extractable organic carbon to extractable total nitrogen (EOC:ETN), soil carbon mineralization rate (C-min), and peroxidase activity (PER), resulting in increased CO2 emission. In contrast, the absence of roots increased the nitrogen cycling variables, such as soil extractable total nitrogen (ETN), nitrate nitrogen content (NO3--N), the ratio of soil extractable organic carbon to extractable total nitrogen (EOC:ETN), soil net nitrogen mineralization rate (N-min), and the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), leading to increased N2O emission. Moreover, soil CH4 uptake was mainly influenced by soil microclimate: aboveground litter input reduced CH4 uptake by lowering soil temperature, while belowground roots benefited CH4 uptake via reducing soil moisture by water uptake. Taken together, our study suggests that soil CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions (or uptake) are influenced by both aboveground and belowground plant inputs through various pathways. While aboveground litter input promotes the emissions of greenhouse gasses, the mitigating effect of belowground roots on N2O and CH4 partially offsets the increment of CO2 emission in this plantation.

TI  - A global meta-analysis of soil nitrogen-cycling variables under no-tillage as compared to conventional tillage
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsAs the core management practice of conservation agriculture, no-tillage (NT) is critical for stimulating soil nutrient cycling and sustaining crop productivity on farmland. However, our comprehensive understanding of nitrogen cycling is limited by contradictory results on nitrogen loss and the absence of a global quantitative assessment of nitrogen transformation processes and genes under NT. Therefore, this study aims to explore the impact of NT on soil nitrogen-cycling variables on a global scale.MethodsA global meta-analysis with 304 observations from 60 publications was conducted on the effects of NT on soil nitrogen transformation rate, nitrogen-cycling gene abundances, and nitrogen pools.ResultsNT significantly increased soil net mineralization rate, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria gene abundance, total nitrogen, and ammonium nitrogen by 18.2%, 20.3%, 12.5%, and 17.4%, respectively, but it significantly reduced nitrogenase reductase gene abundance. Further investigation revealed that climatic conditions, soil properties, and agronomic practices at the experimental sites affect changes in soil nitrogen-cycling variables induced by NT. We found that NT-induced changes in the nitrogen transformation rate and the abundance of genes involved in the denitrification process were positively correlated with the mean annual temperature and aridity index, respectively. In addition, the combination of sustainable agronomic management practices with NT, such as straw return, crop rotation, and lower nitrogen fertilizer application, positively affects soil nitrogen cycling processes.ConclusionsOverall, these results provide insights into understanding how NT affects soil nitrogen cycling and highlight the importance of rational agronomic management practices in stimulating soil nitrogen cycling under NT.

TI  - Auricularia cornea cv. Yu Muer residue fertilizer promotes Leonurus japonicus growth and leonurine accumulation via microbiome-driven nitrogen cycling
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsAuricularia cornea cv. Yu Muer residue fertilizer (YMRF), a promising soil amendment derived from co-composting with chicken manure, has unclear potential for application in Leonurus japonicus cultivation. Therefore, YMRF was tested in pot trials to assess its role in improving plant growth and the accumulation of medicinal compounds through soil optimization.MethodsCo-composting YMRF with chicken manure demonstrated superior compatibility for plant growth. Pot trials tested three YMRF-to-soil ratios (1:1, 1:2, pure YMRF) against a soil control. Plant growth parameters, soil physicochemical properties, microbial communities, and bioactive compounds were analyzed via HPLC and metagenomic sequencing.ResultsThe 1:1 YMRF:soil ratio (OQ group) optimized L. japonicus growth (height: 76.54 cm; biomass: 0.66 g/plant) and leonurine content (346.84 mu g/g) while elevating key substrate nutrients (OC, TN, AP, AK, HA, FA, HM). This amendment balanced organic matter mineralization, enriched thermophilic taxa (Thermobacillus, Thermoactinomyces), and suppressed pathogens (e.g., Rhodococcus equi). Concurrently, it reduced the abundance of antibiotic resistance gene and enhanced nitrogen cycle functions (DNRA, glutamine synthetase), despite post-cultivation AP decrease in OQ1 (20.12 mg/kg). The integrated effect promoted microbial-driven ammonium assimilation and soil health.ConclusionsThese results establish YMRF as a sustainable biofertilizer for L. japonicus cultivation, addressing soil degradation and enhancing medicinal compound yields through microbiome-driven nutrient cycling.

TI  - Environmental stressors altered the groundwater microbiome and nitrogen cycling: A focus on influencing mechanisms and pathways
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Nitrogen cycling, as an important biogeochemical process in groundwater, strongly impacts the energy and matter flow of groundwater ecology. Phthalate esters (PAEs) were screened as key environmental stressors in the groundwater of Beijing, contributing to the alteration of microbial community structure and functions; thus, it could be deduced that these stressors might influence nitrogen cycling that is almost exclusively mediated by microorganisms. Identification of the influences of PAEs on groundwater nitrogen cycling and exploration of the potential influence mechanisms and pathways are vital but still challenging. This study explored the influence mechanisms and pathways of the environmental stressor PAE on nitrogen cycling in groundwater collected from typical monitoring station in Beijing based on high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis com-bined with mediation analysis methods. The results suggested that among the 5 detected PAEs, dimethyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate significantly negatively impacted nitrogen cycling processes, especially nitrogen fixation and denitrification processes (p < 0.05), in groundwater. Their influences were fully or partially mediated by functional microorganisms, particularly assigned keystone genera (such as Dechloromonas, Aero-monas and Noviherbaspirillum), whose abundance was significantly inhibited by these PAEs via dysregulation of carbohydrate metabolism and activation of defense mechanisms. These findings confirmed that the influences of environmental stressors PAEs on nitrogen cycling in groundwater might be mediated by the "PAE stress- groundwater microbiome-nitrogen cycling alteration" pathway. This study may advance the understanding of the consequences of environmental stressors on groundwater ecology and support the ecological hazard assessment of groundwater stressors.

TI  - Changes in carbon input alter the functional characteristics of soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in Picea schrenkiana pure forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic changes in net plant primary production affect above- and belowgroundcarbon inputs to forest soils, in which microbial communities play a key role. Picea schrenkiana forests are important ecological barriers and valuable biological resources in the Tianshan Mountains. Investigating the response of microbial-mediated soil nutrient cycling to exogenous carbon input has great theoretical value. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the changes in soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling pathways and functional genes in the spruce forest area of Picea schrenkiana via a 6-year field manipulation experiment by using metagenomic sequencing technology. The results revealed that the double litter treatment resulted in a greater abundance of functional genes involved in N and P cycling and significantly increased the relative abundance of assimilation (nasA), ammonification (ureC), and P uptake and translocation processes (plpQ and phnE). The no-root treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of soil nitrification (amoA), denitrification (nirK) and P starvation response regulation (phoR and phoB). In the network, the no-root treatment presented the greatest number of network topology attributes, and key genes were influenced mainly by the soil total nitrogen and electrical conductivity. Pathway analysis revealed that microbial diversity had a significant direct effect on the abundance of N and P cycling genes. These insights deepened our understanding of the N and P cycle in arid zone montane forest ecosystems and provided a biological perspective on the microbial genetic potential of soil N and P cycle under different long-term carbon inputs.

TI  - Global contribution of pelagic fungi to protein degradation in the ocean
T2  - MICROBIOME
AB  - Background:Fungi are important degraders of organic matter responsible for reintegration of nutrients into global food chains in freshwater and soil environments. Recent evidence suggests that they are ubiquitously present in the oceanic water column where they play an active role in the degradation of carbohydrates. However, their role in processing other abundant biomolecules in the ocean in comparison with that of prokaryotes remains enigmatic. Here, we performed a global-ocean multi-omics analysis of all fungal-affiliated peptidases (main enzymes responsible for cleaving proteins), which constitute the major fraction (> 50%) of marine living and detrital biomass. We determined the abundance, expression, diversity, taxonomic affiliation, and functional classification of the genes encoding all pelagic fungal peptidases from the epi- and mesopelagic layers.
   Results:We found that pelagic fungi are active contributors to protein degradation and nitrogen cycling in the global ocean. Dothideomycetes are the main fungi responsible for protease activity in the surface layers, whereas Leotiomycetes dominate in the mesopelagic realm. Gene abundance, diversity, and expression increased with increasing depth, similar to fungal CAZymes. This contrasts with the total occurrence of prokaryotic peptidases and CAZymes which are more uniformly distributed in the oceanic water column, suggesting potentially different ecological niches of fungi and prokaryotes. In-depth analysis of the most widely expressed fungal protease revealed the potentially dominating role of saprotrophic nutrition in the oceans.
   Conclusions:Our findings expand the current knowledge on the role of oceanic fungi in the carbon cycle (carbohydrates) to the so far unknown global participation in nitrogen (proteins) degradation, highlighting potentially different ecological niches occupied by fungi and prokaryotes in the global ocean.

TI  - Nitrogen source preference and community assembly shape microbial function in biological soil crusts of the Gurbantunggut Desert
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Biological soil crusts (BSCs) play vital roles in stabilizing desert soils, regulating nutrient cycles, and supporting plant establishment, making their spatial and temporal distribution key indicators of desert ecosystem stability. Using metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed microbial communities in bare sand, algal crusts, and moss crusts in the Gurbantunggut Desert, aiming to elucidate the connections between microbial dynamics and key ecological processes during BSC development to uncover how microscale microbial processes shape broader spatial ecosystem patterns. The three soil types exhibited distinct microbial communities and functional capacities, particularly in carbon fixation and nitrogen cycling processes. Microbial network complexity increased from bare sand to algal and moss crusts,with higher clustering in algal crusts and shorter connectivity paths in moss crusts, both indicating intensified microbial interactions and network cohesion. Algal crusts showed reduced prokaryotic carbon sequestration potential, likely driven by ammonium limitation that suppressed carbon cycling gene expression in heterotrophic taxa (e.g., Actinobacteria), while dominant Cyanobacteria sustained baseline photosynthesis to support early crust development. Differences in microbial nitrogen utilization strategies altered nitrogen cycling dynamics and contributed to niche differentiation among crust types. These shifts reflected strong environmental filtering, which shaped both microbial composition and functional potential across the successional gradient. Source tracking analysis indicates that bare ground was the primary microbial source during BSC succession and that microbial inheritance between crust types was selective rather than continuous. Our findings uncover key mechanisms driving microbial community assembly and succession in desert BSCs, offering new insights for ecological monitoring and restoration in arid environments.

TI  - Rhizosphere microbial community and function activation in rain-fed agricultural areas confer growth advantages to spring maize
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The integration of maize stover return and organic alternative cropping under mulching (MSO) represents an efficacious production strategy in the rain-fed agricultural landscapes. In this study, we employed a two-year field experiment coupled with high-throughput sequencing technology to delineate the mechanisms by which rhizosphere microbes facilitate spring maize growth under the MSO strategy, thereby elucidating the microbial contributions to crop productivity. Our findings indicate that MSO serves as a potent conduit for soil carbon sequestration, with a 3.48 % increase in soil organic carbon relative to conventional chemical fertilizer applications. The concentrations of microbial biomass carbon, dissolved organic carbon and readily oxidizable carbon reached their zenith under MSO conditions. Soil carbon components emerged as crucial determinants of both bacterial and fungal communities, influencing their composition and potential functionalities. The alteration of the rhizosphere microbiome mediated by stover return reshaped the carbon and nitrogen cycling pathways within the rhizosphere. In the functional prediction of the rhizosphere, stover incorporation reinforced the twocomponent system process while mitigating the quorum sensing pathway. Within the elemental cycle prediction model, the processes of methane and CO2 generation from organic carbon in the rhizosphere carbon cycle, as well as the nitrification and ammonia oxidation processes in the nitrogen cycle, exhibited divergent trends with the introduction of stover. The co-occurrence network analysis revealed a more robust cooperative network among rhizosphere bacteria under the MSO mode compared to fungi. This study offers a novel perspective on the MSO strategy in rain-fed agricultural regions and underscores the pivotal role of key ecological clusters within the rhizosphere in the plant-microbial interaction process.

TI  - Melanin mitigates the accelerated decay of mycorrhizal necromass with peatland warming
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Despite being a significant input into soil carbon pools of many high-latitude ecosystems, little is known about the effects of climate change on the turnover of mycorrhizal fungal necromass. Here, we present results from the first experiment examining the effects of climate change on the long-term decomposition of mycorrhizal necromass, utilising the Spruce and Peatland Response Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. Warming significantly increased necromass decomposition rates but was strongest in normally submerged microsites where warming caused water table drawdown. Necromass chemistry exerted the strongest control on the decomposition, with initial nitrogen content strongly predicting early decay rates (3 months) and initial melanin content determining mass remaining after 2 years. Collectively, our results suggest that as global temperatures rise, variation in species biochemical traits as well as microsites where mycorrhizal necromass is deposited will determine how these important inputs contribute to the belowground storage of carbon in boreal peatlands.

TI  - Chiral herbicide imazethapy influences plant-soil feedback on nitrogen metabolism by shaping rhizosphere microorganisms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Herbicides are known to affect the soil nitrogen cycle by shaping soil microorganisms. However, it is not clear how herbicides regulate diverse transformation processes of soil nitrogen cycling by altering rhizosphere microorganisms, subsequently influencing the feedback to plant nitrogen metabolism. Here, we investigated how imazethapyr (IM) enantiomers drive plant-soil feedback on nitrogen metabolism by altering the rhizosphere microorganisms. The results indicated that (R)- and (S)-IM significantly changed the composition and structure rhizosphere microbiome with enantioselectivity and functional changes in microbial communities were associated with soil nitrogen circulation. The determination of nitrogen-cycling functional genes further supported the above findings. The results revealed that (R)- and (S)-IM could change the abundance of nitrogen-cycling functional genes by changing specific bacteria abundances, such as Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteria, thus resulting in diverse nitrogen transformation processes. The alternation of nitrogen transformation processes indicated (R)-IM exhibited a more notable tendency to form a nitrogen cycling pattern with lower energy cost and higher nitrogen retention than (S)-IM. Sterilization experiments demonstrated changes in soil nitrogen cycling drive plant nitrogen metabolism and rhizosphere microorganisms are responsible for the above process of plant-soil feedback for nitrogen metabolism. Under IM enantiomer treatments, rhizosphere microorganisms might stimulate glutamate synthesis by promoting NH4+ uptake and glutamine-glutamate synthesis cycling in roots, thus contributing to positive feedback, with (R)-IM treatments showing more pronounced positive feedback on nitrogen metabolism than (S)-IM treatments. Our results provide theoretical support for determining the mechanism by which IM enantiomers drive plant-soil nitrogen metabolism by changing the rhizosphere microbial communities.

TI  - Microbial community dynamics alleviate stoichiometric constraints during litter decay
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Under the current paradigm, organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling rates are a function of the imbalance between substrate and microbial biomass stoichiometry. Challenging this view, we demonstrate that in an individual-based model, microbial community dynamics alter relative C and N limitation during litter decomposition, leading to a system behaviour not predictable from stoichiometric theory alone. Rather, the dynamics of interacting functional groups lead to an adaptation at the community level, which accelerates nitrogen recycling in litter with high initial C:N ratios and thus alleviates microbial N limitation. This mechanism allows microbial decomposers to overcome large imbalances between resource and biomass stoichiometry without the need to decrease carbon use efficiency (CUE), which is in contrast to predictions of traditional stoichiometric mass balance equations. We conclude that identifying and implementing microbial community-driven mechanisms in biogeochemical models are necessary for accurately predicting terrestrial C fluxes in response to changing environmental conditions.

TI  - Straw mulch improves soil carbon and nitrogen cycle by mediating microbial community structure and function in the maize field
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the capability of the microbial community characteristics and soil variables to promote carbon and nitrogen cycles in maize fields under straw mulch. We covered the surface soil of the maize field with different amounts of wheat straw (0 kg/ha, 2,250 kg/ha, and 4,500 kg/ha) and used 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing, Biology ECO-plate, traditional enzymology, TOC analyzer, and HPLC to measure bacterial and fungal community composition and functions, characteristics of microbial carbon source metabolism, carbon and nitrogen fraction, enzyme activity, and organic acid content in the maize rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere. The results indicated that short-term straw mulch insignificantly affected the alpha diversity of bacterial and fungal communities whereas significantly influenced their beta diversity. The results of functional prediction revealed that straw mulch considerably boosted the relative abundances of bacteria belonging to chemoheterotrophy, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, ureolysis, and nitrogen fixation and inhibited fermentation and nitrate reduction in maize rhizosphere soil. These processes primarily drove the C and N cycles in soil. Straw mulch also improved fungal saprotrophs by raising the proportion of Chaetomiaceae and Chaetosphaeriaceae. The Biology ECO-plate results illustrated that straw mulch weakened the metabolism capacity of microbial labile carbon resources. As a result, the labile C and N fractions were raised under straw mulch. Our results also showed that straw mulch primarily regulated the microbial community structure in rhizosphere soil by significantly decreasing Firmicutes and Ascomycota relative abundance while increasing Basidiomycota. The fungal community structure is more than bacterial for affecting soil microbial biomass carbon, readily oxidizable organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, available nitrogen, ammonium, and nitrate directly and indirectly through malic acid content and cellulase, protease, and amylase activity. Overall, our findings imply that straw mulch might influence the bacterial and fungal community structures, thereby boosting the production of labile C and N components and accelerating the C and N cycle in maize fields.

TI  - Metagenomics reveals the response of desert steppe microbial communities and carbon-nitrogen cycling functional genes to nitrogen deposition
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: Nitrogen (N) deposition seriously affects the function of carbon (C) and N cycling in terrestrial ecosystems by altering soil microbial communities, especially in desert steppe ecosystems. However, there is a need for a comprehensive understanding of how microorganisms involved in each C and N cycle process respond to N deposition. Methods: In this study, shotgun metagenome sequencing was used to investigate variations in soil C and N cycling-related genes in the desert steppe in northern China after 6 years of the following N deposition: N0 (control); N30 (N addition 30 kg ha(-1) year(-1)): N50 (N addition 50 kg ha(-1) year(-1)). Results: N deposition significantly increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (P < 0.05) while significantly decreased the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria (P < 0.05). This significantly impacted the microbial community composition in desert steppe soils. The annual addition or deposition of 50 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for up to 6 years did not affect the C cycle gene abundance but changed the C cycle-related microorganism community structure. The process of the N cycle in the desert steppe was affected by N deposition (50 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), which increased the abundance of the pmoA-amoA gene related to nitrification and the nirB gene associated with assimilation nitrite reductase. There may be a niche overlap between microorganisms involved in the same C and N cycling processes. Discussion: This study provides new insights into the effects of N deposition on soil microbial communities and functions in desert steppe and a better understanding of the ecological consequences of anthropogenic N addition.

TI  - Land-use change from cropland to plantations affects the abundance of nitrogen cycle-related microorganisms and genes in the Loess Plateau of China
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The "Grain for Green" project has been considered an effective avenue to control soil erosion, improve vegetation coverage and prevent ecosystem degradation in the Loess Plateau of China. However, the effect of the project on the underlying microbial mechanism of soil nitrogen cycling is not well understood. In the present study, the effect of land-use change from cropland to plantations on soil microbial community and functional genes involved in the nitrogen cycle was investigated via metagenomic sequencing analyses. The abundance rather than the composition of functional genes for nitrification, denitrification, assimilatory and dissimilatory nitrogen reduction significantly changed during the conversion of cropland to plantations. The abundance rather than the composition of microorganisms involved in the nitrogen cycle also changed significantly. The effect on the abundance of functional genes and microorganisms was mainly related to changes in soil properties, such as organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium and pH. The observed changes likely decrease the potential of nitrification, denitrification and assimilatory nitrogen reduction in the soil of plantations. Our results demonstrate that land-use change from cropland to plantations significantly affects soil nitrogen cycling in the Loess Plateau of China.

TI  - Metagenomic insights into the effects of desiccation on functions associated with biogeochemical cycles and resistome of microbial communities
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Climate change and human activities are altering the hydrological conditions of wetlands, leading to an increasingly severe desiccation phenomenon. Microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological health of freshwater ecosystems, and in turn, they are influenced by the state of these ecosystems. However, the changes in composition and diversity of functional gene of microbial communities during wetland desiccation remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we employed metagenomic techniques to assess the abundance and diversity of methane cycling genes (MCGs), nitrogen cycling genes (NCGs), sulfur cycling genes (SCGs), phosphorus cycling genes (PCGs), antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), mobile genetic elements (MEGs), and virulence factors (VFs) across various habitats in the Xixi National Wetland Park, including ponds, swamplands, and peatlands. Our results revealed significant differences in gene diversity and abundance, with swampland showing the highest levels of functional gene diversity (mean richness of MCGs: 245, NCGs: 60, SCGs: 165, PCGs: 125, ARGs: 116, MGEs: 39, VFs: 546) among three habitats. Notably, the peatland exhibited a highest abundance of ARGs (mean clean reads >9000), particularly those related to multidrug resistance, and an increase in abundance of virulence factors related to nutritional/metabolic types (from pond and swampland to peatland). Through binning analysis, we identified core functional microbiomes and found that metabolic gene abundance was highest in the peatland. These findings suggest that wetland desiccation may pose risks to ecosystem health by altering the composition and abundance of microbial functional genes.

TI  - Co-occurrence of nitrite-dependent anaerobic ammonium and methane oxidation processes in subtropical acidic forest soils
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n-damo) are two new processes of recent discoveries linking the microbial nitrogen and carbon cycles. In this study, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of anammox bacteria and pmoA gene of n-damo bacteria were used to investigate their distribution and diversity in natural acidic and re-vegetated forest soils. The 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved featured at least three species in two genera known anammox bacteria, namely Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans, Candidatus Brocadia fulgida, and Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis while the pmoA gene amplified was affiliated with two species of known n-damo bacteria Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera and a newly established Candidatus Methylomirabilis sp. According to the results, the diversity of anammox bacteria in natural forests was lower than in re-vegetated forests, but no significant difference was observed in n-damo community between them. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that both anammox and n-damo bacteria were more abundant in the lower layer (10-20 cm) than the surface layer (0-5 cm). The abundance of anammox bacteria varied from 2.21 x 10(5) to 3.90 x 10(6) gene copies per gram dry soil, and n-damo bacteria quantities were between 1.69 x 10(5) and 5.07 x 10(6) gene copies per gram dry soil in the two different layers. Both anammox and n-damo bacteria are reported for the first time to co-occur in acidic forest soil in this study, providing a more comprehensive information on more defined microbial processes contributing to C and N cycles in the ecosystems.

TI  - Soil amendments with ethylene precursor alleviate negative impacts of salinity on soil microbial properties and productivity
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Some microbes enhance stress tolerance in plants by minimizing plant ethylene levels via degradation of its immediate precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC), in the rhizosphere. In return, ACC is used by these microbes as a source of nitrogen. This mutualistic relationship between plants and microbes may be used to promote soil properties in stressful environments. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that amendments of ACC in soils reshape the structure of soil microbiome and alleviate the negative impacts of salinity on soil properties. We treated non-saline and artificially-developed saline soils with ACC in different concentrations for 14 days. The structure of soil microbiome, soil microbial properties and productivity were examined. Our results revealed that microbial composition of bacteria, archaea and fungi in saline soils was affected by ACC amendments; whereas community composition in non-saline soils was not affected. The amendments of ACC could not fully counteract the negative effects of salinity on soil microbial activities and productivity, but increased the abundance of ACC deaminase-encoding gene (acdS), enhanced soil microbial respiration, enzymatic activity, nitrogen and carbon cycling potentials and Arabidopsis biomass in saline soils. Collectively, our study indicates that ACC amendments in soils could efficiently ameliorate salinity impacts on soil properties and plant biomass production.

TI  - Detection of nitrogen cycle genes in soils for measuring the effects of changes in land use and management
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Nutrient cycles represent key links between above- and below-ground ecosystems. But obscurity of functional diversity of nutrient-cycling organisms has constrained our understanding. We studied the microbial ecology of the nitrogen cycle using bacterial genes involved in nitrification (amoA), denitrification (napA) and nitrogen fixation (nifH) from areas with highly contrasting soils, climates and land management practices within Australia. Agricultural soils had greater frequency of occurrence of nitrogen cycling genes compared with areas of adjacent remnant native vegetation. The relative abundance of the nitrate reductase gene, napA, increased following the addition of urea to soils, indicating a pulse-response of nitrate-reducing bacteria. Laboratory perturbation of soils with highly saline water had no effect on the frequency of functional gene detection, but following perturbation of soils with antibiotics, the presence of amoA fell below detectable levels while levels of ammonia increased over time. In contrast, nifH and napA were detected in some soils for the duration of the perturbation experiments. This observed positive relationship between gene abundance and respective process rates was indicative of an active bacterial population. As such, detection and quantification of bacterial genes involved in the nitrogen cycle represents a model system for gaining insights to soil microbial diversity and ecosystem function.

TI  - Context-dependent effects of grassland degradation on soil nitrogen cycling processes
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Grassland degradation, as a result of climate change and anthropogenic activities, is reported to impair soil nitrogen cycling processes. However, there is little evidence on the spatial patterns of the degradation effects across broad environmental gradients. Here we measured soil available nitrogen contents and related nitrogen transformation processes from 45 grassland degradation sequences on the Tibetan Plateau. On average across all degradation sequences, the nitrogen-cycling parameters tended to decline from non-degraded to heavily degraded stages in most cases. However, a cross-sequence analysis showed that grassland degradation decreased soil nitrogen-cycling parameters when their corresponding background status (i.e., nitrogen-cycling parameters of non-degraded plots) was high but increased them when the respective background status was low, regardless of degradation stages. The above findings demonstrate that grassland degradation may not always, as previously assumed, reduce soil nitrogen cycling processes. Considering background nitrogen status is a key for grassland restoration when applying the nutrient-based strategies.

TI  - Alpine wetland degradation affects carbon cycle function genes but does not reduce soil microbial diversity
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Soil microorganisms represent an important driving force of biogeochemical cycles and are closely related to the soil carbon cycle during alpine wetland degradation. However, studies on the mechanisms underlying the effects of alpine wetland degradation on carbon cycling mediated by soil microorganisms are limited. Therefore, this study performed metagenome sequencing analyses of the changes in soil microbial communities and their carbon cycling functional genes in three habitats (alpine wetland, alpine meadow, and degraded meadow) on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We found that the alpha diversity of bacteria and fungi did not decrease continuously as wetland degradation intensified but increased at the initial stage of degradation. The carbon fixation and methane metabolism gene abundance was significantly higher in alpine wetlands than in alpine and degraded meadows, while the relative abundance of recalcitrant carbon degradation genes increased with increasing wetland degradation. The changes in soil nutrient conditions caused by degradation may lead to different carbon sequestration pathways by microorganisms. Soil pH and nutrients were the main soil factors affecting carbon cycling functional gene abundance. Wetland degradation may be related to phosphorus limitation in soil microorganisms. Our results suggest that alpine wetland degradation significantly affected soil microbial carbon cycling functional genes, and adversely impacted soil microbial carbon sequestration.

TI  - STUDIES ON MICROBIAL MECHANISMS OF PERMAFROST CARBON CONVERSION TO CLIMATE WARMING: RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Recently, very active studies have been undertaken on the response and stability of permafrost carbon pool and key biogeochemical processes in permafrost regions to climate warming. By observing the significant differences in microbial community structure in regions of seasonal frost and permafrost, it is evident that microbes play key roles in the conversion of permafrost carbon. This paper reviews research progress at the cutting edges on the conversion and decomposition of permafrost carbon to climate warming and subsequent changes in microbial activities over the past decade. Findings indicated that: (1) Freezethaw cycles of soils in the active layer in permafrost regions showed an increasing annual trend and the existing survival patterns of permafrost microbes may be altered by the increasing freeze-thaw frequency; and (2) Soil microbes are an essential part of the cold-regions ecosystem and they play vital roles in soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, the mineralization and decomposition of soil organic matter. Thus, climate warming and subsequent permafrost degradation affect the conversion and decomposition of permafrost carbon, resulting in changes in CO2 and CH4 emissions, soil environmental factors, and soil microbial community structures. The laws for governing permafrost carbon conversion and the self-regulation mechanisms of soil microbes are important for natural ecosystems and environments in cold regions, and affect the strengths of greenhouse gas sources and sinks in permafrost regions.

TI  - Bacteria and fungi differentially contribute to carbon and nitrogen cycles during biological soil crust succession in arid ecosystems
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are widely considered critical for soil fertility in arid ecosystems. However, how microbial communities regulate the C and N cycles during BSC succession is not well understood. Methods We utilized GeoChip 5.0 to analyze the functional potential of bacteria and fungi involved in the C and N cycles of BSCs along a 61-year revegetation chronosequence. Results The normalized average signal intensities of different functional genes involved in C and N metabolism in 61-year-old BSCs were significantly different from those in younger BSCs and most functional gene subcategories and the corresponding dominant functional populations were derived from bacterial rather than fungal communities. Most C degradation genes (dominated by the starch-degrading gene amyA) were derived from Actinobacteria (mainly Streptomyces) in bacteria, but Ascomycota (mainly Aspergillus) was the key population for lignin degradation (dominated by the phenol oxidase gene) during BSC succession. N cycle genes involved in denitrification (such as narG, nirK/S, and nosZ) and N fixation (nifH) were mainly derived from Unclassified Bacteria, whereas genes involved in ammonification (ureC) were mainly derived from Streptomyces. Moreover, redundancy analysis showed that soil biogeochemical properties were closely related to bacterial and fungal functional gene structures during BSC succession. Conclusions These findings indicate that bacteria play a crucial role in the regulation of C and N cycles during BSC succession in arid ecosystems, while fungi perform supplementary degradation of lignin, and these communities can successfully stimulate an increase in C and N metabolism in soil during the later successional stages of BSCs.

TI  - Protein breakdown represents a major bottleneck in nitrogen cycling in grassland soils
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Proteins represent the dominant input of organic N into most ecosystems and they also constitute the largest store of N in soil organic matter. The extracellular protease mediated breakdown of proteins to amino acids therefore represents a key step regulating N cycling in soil. In this study we investigated the influence of a range of environmental factors on the rate of protein mineralization in a grazed grassland and fallow agricultural soil. The protein turnover rates were directly compared to the rates of amino acid mineralization under the same conditions. Uniformly C-14-labelled soluble protein and amino acids were added to soil and the rate of (CO2)-C-14 evolution determined over 30 d. Our results indicate that the primary phase of protein mineralization was approximately 20 +/- 3 fold slower that the rate of amino acid mineralization. The addition of large amounts of inorganic NO3- and NH4+ to the soil did not repress the rate of protein mineralization suggesting that available N does not directly affect protease activity in the short term. Whilst protein mineralization was strongly temperature sensitive, the presence of plants and the addition of humic and tannic acids had relatively little influence on the rate of soluble protein degradation in this fertile grassland soil. Our results suggests that the extracellular protease mediated cleavage of proteins to amino acids rather than breakdown of amino acids to NH4+ represents the limiting step in soil N cycling.

TI  - Mulching practices alter soil microbial functional diversity and benefit to soil quality in orchards on the Loess Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - To improve our understanding about the responses of microbial functional diversity to different mulching practices, this study used a metagenomic approach to reveal soil microbial functional specificity under four tillage regimes: conventional tillage (CT), organic mulch practices with ryegrass (Loliumperenne L.) intercropping cover (RE) and cornstalk mulch (CS), and inorganic mulching with black ground fabric (BF) in a 7-year field experiment in an apple orchard of the Loess Plateau in China. Enzyme activity and soil physicochemical properties were measured. A redundancy analysis showed that the RE and CS treatments had positive effects on soil nutrient and enzyme activity compared to that of the BF and CT treatments. The CS and RE treatments increased beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, and beta-xylosidase activities. In addition, the CS treatment significantly enhanced the beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase and urease activities compared to that under CT treatment. However, the activity of these enzyme was reduced in the BF treatment compared with that of the CT treatment. The results also indicated that the enzymes activities were not completely consistent with the changing trends of the genes encoding these enzymes. In addition, the RE and CS treatments also increased the abundance of genes encoding carbohydrate enzymes. It is interesting that the RE and CS treatments had more pathway genes associated with the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and amino acid metabolism compared with the BF treatment. Remarkably, RE and CS treatments effectively increased the abundance of carbon fixation gene cbbL compared to CT treatment. In summary, organic mulching practices increased the soil microbiological functional diversity related to the carbon and nitrogen cycle, while inorganic mulching practice reduced them. This study enhanced our understanding of how mulching practices may alter soil microbial functional diversity and benefit soil quality.

TI  - Characterizing Bacterial Communities in Agroecosystems of the UNESCO Global Geopark Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - This study explores the diversity and functions of microbiomes in ancient agroecosystems of the Mixteca Alta Geopark (MAG). Microbiome analysis could provide insights into soil bacterial communities and their role in enhancing soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and plant growth. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to identify key features in the composition of the microbiota of the Lama-bordo, Valley, and Terrace agroecosystems in MAG. Analysis of agroecosystem soils revealed 21 bacterial phyla, with Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi dominating. These microbial communities contribute to soil health, carbon cycling, and disease suppression. The study identified specific phylogroups and metabolic pathways associated with nutrient-rich environments like Lama-bordo and Valley, and nutrient-poor, sandy soils like Terrace. Soils from Lama-bordo and Valley were grouped due to microbiome similarity despite geographic separation, whereas Terrace soils differed. Nutrient-rich Lama-bordo and Valley soils host copiotrophic bacteria, while nutrient-poor Terrace soils favor oligotrophic species like Acidobacteria. Functional analysis of microbiomes reveals distinct metabolic pathways, including antibiotic biosynthesis (streptomycin, vancomycin) suggesting a role in plant disease resistance, amino acid pathways indicating active nitrogen cycling, and vitamin B5 and lipoic acid pathways contributing to energy metabolism and antioxidant functions.

TI  - Cyanobacterial biofertilizer inoculation has a distinctive effect on the key genes of carbon and nitrogen cycling in paddy rice
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY
AB  - Cyanobacterial biofertilizers provide soil fertility and productivity gains at varying levels in paddy rice cultivation. The colonization and influences of introduced strains in different soil types with characteristic compositions of native cyanobacteria remain largely unknown. In this work, seven paddy rice soils with the composition of indigenous cyanobacteria described by amplicon sequencing analysis were inoculated with the cyanobacterial biofertilizer. The microbial abundance and the cyanophage concentrations were evaluated under light-dark or continuous dark cycles using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays. The copies of cyanobacterial-16S rRNA gene markers varied from 5.65 x 106 to 9.22 x 107 g-1 soil, and their abundance increased significantly in the inoculated soils. The cyanophage concentrations, quantified using the capsid assembly protein gene g20 in the soils tested, ranged from 3.04 x 108 to 9.24x 108 g-1 soil on 30 days after incubation. There were significant increases in the abundance of the nifH gene copies, about 1.54x105 to 1.35x106 g-1, in the inoculated soils, albeit with soil type-specific responses. The gene markers of C and N cycling (i.e., cbbL and nifH, respectively), taxonomic markers (of archaea, bacteria, and cyanobacteria), and cyanophage-specific gene copies showed strong and positive correlation with the cyanobacterial biofertilizer inoculation. However, the genes related to nitrification (bacterial and archaeal amoA) and denitrification (nirS, nirK, narG, and nosZ) were clustered together in the uninoculated soils. The rice rhizospheres in three representative paddy soil types, using metatranscriptomics analysis, showed distinctive colonization by cyanobacteria, with several members yet to be described. These results indicate the potential for improving cyanobacterial biofertilizers for their contributions to plant growth and fertility gains in a soil-specific way.

TI  - Temperature sensitivity of peatland C and N cycling: Does substrate supply play a role?
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Northern peatlands constitute an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle due to their long-term accumulation of soil organic matter. This function as a carbon sink is partly dependent on low temperatures limiting decomposition and nutrient cycling, so global warming has the potential to alter the C balance of these systems and feedback to climate change. Field observations have shown that peatland organic matter decomposition, ecosystem respiration and nitrogen cycling are closely related processes that show a large degree of temperature sensitivity. In the current study, we investigated whether seasonal dynamics of substrate input may be an indirect mechanism accounting for this observed sensitivity. We carried out a 60-day mesocosm incubation experiment with sub-arctic peat soil to compare the direct effects of temperature increase with the indirect effects of increased microbial- or plant-derived organic matter input on key soil C and N cycling processes and substrate pools. Additions of dead microbial cells led to an 83% increase in organic N pool sizes, 16-64% increases in the potential activities of most soil enzymes, a transient increase in the relative abundance of beta-proteobacteria, and a decrease in the relative abundance of alpha-proteo-, Actino- and Acido-bacteria. Neither the addition of plant root litter, nor a 5 degrees C alteration in incubation temperatures, had comparable effects on these parameters. Peat respiration was positively affected by both substrate addition (20-46% increase) and higher incubation temperatures (34-38% increase), but the temperature-only effect was not sufficient to account for the increases in respiration observed in field experiments. Thus, it appears that warming effects on C and N cycle processes can potentially be driven by indirect effects, with alterations to the seasonal flux of microbe-derived organic matter a particularly potent mechanism. The high temperature sensitivity of decomposition and respiration may therefore be largely a result of warming-induced changes in substrate supply rates. We propose that climate change models of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling should seek to incorporate realistic microbial biomass dynamics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle: A review of advances over 50 years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Quantifying ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks is essential for better understanding the global carbon cycle and improving projections of the carbon-climate feedbacks. Remote sensing has played a vital role in this endeavor during the last five decades by quantifying carbon fluxes and stocks. The availability of satellite observations of the land surface since the 1970s, particularly the early 1980s, has made it feasible to quantify ecosystem carbon fluxes and stocks at regional to global scales. Here we provide a review of the advances in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle from the early 1970s to present. First, we present an overview of the terrestrial carbon cycle and remote sensing of carbon fluxes and stocks. Remote sensing data acquired in a broad wavelength range (visible, infrared, and microwave) of the electromagnetic spectrum have been used to estimate carbon fluxes and/or stocks. Second, we provide a historical overview of the key milestones in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Third, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in remote sensing of carbon fluxes. The remote sensing data and techniques used to quantify carbon fluxes include vegetation indices, light use efficiency models, terrestrial biosphere models, data-driven (or machine learning) approaches, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), land surface temperature, and atmospheric inversions. Fourth, we review the platforms/sensors, methods, findings, and challenges in passive optical, microwave, and lidar remote sensing of biomass carbon stocks as well as remote sensing of soil organic carbon. Fifth, we review the progresses in remote sensing of disturbance impacts on the carbon cycle. Sixth, we also discuss the uncertainty and validation of the resulting carbon flux and stock estimates. Finally, we offer a forward-looking perspective and insights for future research and directions in remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in carbon cycling studies in the future. This comprehensive and insightful review on 50?years of remote sensing of the terrestrial carbon cycle is timely and valuable and can benefit scientists in various research communities (e.g., carbon cycle, remote sensing, climate change, ecology) and inform ecosystem and carbon management, carbon-climate projections, and climate policymaking.

TI  - Metagenomics study of soil microorganisms involved in the carbon cycle in a saline-alkaline meadow steppe in the Songnen Plain in Northeast China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil microorganisms play an important role in regulating and contributing to carbon cycling processes in grassland ecosystems. Soil salinization is one of the major problems causing soil degradation, and its effects on carbon cycle immobilization-related functional genes in soil microorganisms remain unknown. Therefore, we took Songnen salinization grassland as the research object, selected grasslands with different salinization levels, and explored the diversity of soil microorganisms and functional genes related to carbon cycling in Songnen grassland with different salinization levels through metagenomic technology. The results showed that with the increase of salinity, the relative abundance of Ascomycetes increased, while the relative abundance of Proteus and Firmicutes decreased. In addition, the relative abundance of functional genes related to carbon cycling fixation has also decreased. As the degree of soil salinization increases, the relative abundance of glycoside hydrolases (GH)130 family significantly increases, while the relative abundance of soil carbohydrate enzymes belonging to GH3 and GH55 families significantly decreases. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), it was found that soil pH and conductivity (EC) have a significant impact on soil microbial diversity and functional genes related to carbon cycling fixation. The increase in soil pH directly reduces the Shannon diversity of soil microbial diversity and functional genes related to carbon cycling fixation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the intensification of grassland salinization reduces the diversity of bacteria and fungi, and affects the diversity of functional genes related to carbon cycling fixation by reducing the total diversity of bacteria. The increase in salinity has a negative feedback effect on grassland soil carbon cycling. This study provides a theoretical framework for grassland soil carbon sequestration and degradation restoration.

TI  - Conversion of monocropping to intercropping promotes rhizosphere microbiome functionality and soil nitrogen cycling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Intercropping can increase soil nutrient availability and provide greater crop yields for intensive agroecosystems. Despite its multiple benefits, how intercropping influences rhizosphere microbiome assemblages, functionality, and complex soil nitrogen cycling is not fully understood. Here, a three-year field experiment was carried out on different cropping system with five fertilization treatments at the main soybean production regions. We found that soybean yields in intercropped systems were on average 17 % greater than in monocropping system, regardless of fertilization treatments. We also found that intercropping systems significant increased network modularity (by 46 %) and functional diversity (by 11 %) than monocropping systems. Metagenomics analyses further indicated intercropping promotes microbiome functional adaptation, particularly enriching core functions related to nitrogen metabolism. Cropping patterns had a stronger influence on the functional genes associated with soil nitrogen cycling (R-2 = 0.499). Monocropping systems increased the abundance of functional genes related to organic nitrogen ammonification, nitrogen fixation, and denitrification, while functional guilds of nitrate assimilation (by 28 %), nitrification (by 31 %), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction (by 10.1 %) genes were enriched in intercropping systems. Furthermore, we found that abiotic factors (i.e. AP, pH, and Moisture) are important drivers in shaping soil microbial community assemblage and nitrogen cycling. The functional genes include hzsB, and nrfA, and nxrA that affected by these biotic and abiotic variables were strongly related to crop yield (R-2 = 0.076 similar to R-2 = 0.249), suggesting a key role for maintaining crop production. We demonstrated that land use conversion from maize monocropping to maize-soybean intercropping diversify rhizosphere microbiome and functionality signatures, and intercropping increased key gene abundance related to soil nitrogen cycling to maintain the advantage of crop yield. The results of this study significantly facilitate our understanding of the complex soil nitrogen cycling processes and lay the foundation for manipulating desired specific functional taxa for improved crop productivity under sustainable intensification.

TI  - Rewiring the Carbon Cycle: A Theoretical Framework for Animal-Driven Ecosystem Carbon Sequestration
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Most carbon cycle models do not consider animal-mediated effects, focusing instead on carbon exchanges among plants, microbes, and the atmosphere. Yet, a growing body of empirical evidence from diverse ecosystems points to pervasive animal effects on ecosystem carbon cycling and shows that ignoring them could lead to misrepresentation of an ecosystem's carbon cycle. We develop a new theoretical framework to account for animal effects on ecosystem carbon cycling. We combine a classic ecosystem compartment modeling approach with a classic carbon model to account for carbon flux and storage among plant, animal, and soil microbial trophic compartments. We show, by way of numerical analyses of steady state conditions across three competing scenarios, that animal presence alters the dominant pathways of control over carbon storage and capture. This altered control arises via direct, consumptive effects and especially via indirect, non-consumptive pathways by instigating faster nutrient recycling. This leads to a quantitative change in the ecosystem's carbon balance, enhancing the amount of carbon captured and stored in the ecosystem. Further, the indirect pathways appear especially important in enabling these effects because of their sensitivity to the structure of the ecosystem's food chain. The modeling shows that animals could play a larger role in ecosystem carbon cycle than previously thought. Our framework provides further guidance for empirical research aimed at quantifying animal-mediated control of carbon cycling and to inform the development of nature-based climate change solutions that leverage animal influence on the carbon cycle to help mitigate climate change.
   The mathematical tools that scientists use to account for the amount of carbon captured and stored in ecosystems rarely consider the effects of animals. This stems from the assumption that because animals are much rarer than plants and microbes in ecosystems their potential influence ought to be minimal. Yet, field studies have begun to show that this assumption may not be accurate. Here, we report on modeling analyses that incorporate insights from field research about the different ways that animals can affect carbon uptake and storage in ecosystems through their interactions with plants and microbes. Our analyses show that animal presence fundamentally changes the relationships between plants, microbes, and the environment. In turn, this leads to large changes in the amount of carbon captured and stored in ecosystems relative to conditions that exclude animals. Hence, animals can be allies in fighting climate change as a key addition to the growing portfolio of nature-based climate change solutions.
   Animals rewire ecosystem food webs and thereby qualitatively change the dominant control over carbon cycling Animal-mediated top-down control of the carbon cycle quantitatively changes key ecosystem processes, increasing carbon sequestration Leveraging animal-driven carbon capture may lead to more accurate ecosystem carbon budgets, enhancing nature-based climate change solutions

TI  - Soil Microbiomes Under Climate Change and Implications for Carbon Cycling
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCES, VOL 45
AB  - Communities of soil microorganisms (soil microbiomes) play a major role in biogeochemical cycles and support of plant growth. Here we focus primarily on the roles that the soil microbiome plays in cycling soil organic carbon and the impact of climate change on the soil carbon cycle. We first discuss current challenges in understanding the roles carried out by highly diverse and heterogeneous soil microbiomes and review existing knowledge gaps in understanding how climate change will impact soil carbon cycling by the soil microbiome. Because soil microbiome stability is a key metric to understand as the climate changes, we discuss different aspects of stability, including resistance, resilience, and functional redundancy. We then review recent research pertaining to the impact of major climate perturbations on the soil microbiome and the functions that they carry out. Finally, we review new experimental methodologies and modeling approaches under development that should facilitate our understanding of the complex nature of the soil microbiome to better predict its future responses to climate change.

TI  - Effects of macrophyte functional group richness on emergent freshwater wetland functions
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Most plant diversity-function studies have been conducted in terrestrial ecosystems and have focused on plant productivity and nutrient uptake/retention, with a notable lack of attention paid to belowground processes (e. g., root dynamics, decomposition, trace gas fluxes). Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we assessed how the richness of emergent macrophyte functional groups influences aboveground and belowground plant growth and microbial-mediated functions related to carbon and nitrogen cycling, with an emphasis on methane (CH4) efflux and potential denitrification rates. We found that an increase in the richness of wetland plant functional groups enhanced belowground plant biomass, altered rooting patterns, and decreased methane efflux, while having no effect on aboveground plant production or denitrification potential. We hypothesize that the greater root production and increased rooting depth in the highest diversity treatments enhanced CH4 oxidation to a relatively greater degree than methane production, leading to an overall decrease in CH4 efflux across our plant functional group richness gradient.

TI  - The driving role of microorganisms in the soil carbon cycle of mountain forests in arid areas under different carbon inputs
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsCarbon cycling is crucial for forest ecosystem function and stability. Litter and root inputs, as the main sources in the soil carbon cycle, play a key role in soil carbon accumulation in arid zones. We aimed at determining the effects of litter and root inputs on the soil microbial carbon cycle in arid areas.MethodsUsing metagenomic technology, combined with R software, hierarchical partition analysis, network analysis, and correlation analysis, we investigated the results of a six-year plant residue addition and removal experiment and compared the microbial communities, pathways and associated genes, and network patterns related to soil carbon cycling under litter and root inputs.ResultsNo root treatment promoted an increase in the diversity of microorganisms involved in the carbon cycle. Double litter treatment increased the abundance of genes related to carbon fixation and starch degradation. No input treatment significantly reduced the abundance of carbon degradation and carbon fixation genes, while No input treatment increased the abundance of genes involved in hemicellulose degradation, with the abundance of abfA and MAN2C genes increasing by 166% and 481%, respectively, compared to the Control treatment. Among the networks, no root treatment possessed the highest network topological properties. Key genes involved in the carbon cycle were mainly from the carbon fixation pathway, and key genes were mainly affected by electrical conductivity and pH.ConclusionsThis study provides important information for understanding the carbon cycle process of mountain forest ecosystems in arid areas.

TI  - Tropical peatlands and their contribution to the global carbon cycle and climate change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that cover 185-423 million hectares (Mha) of the earth's surface. The majority of the world's peatlands are in temperate and boreal zones, whereas tropical ones cover only a total area of 90-170 Mha. However, there are still considerable uncertainties in C stock estimates as well as a lack of information about depth, bulk density and carbon accumulation rates. The incomplete data are notable especially in tropical peatlands located in South America, which are estimated to have the largest area of peatlands in the tropical zone. This paper displays the current state of knowledge surrounding tropical peatlands and their biophysical characteristics, distribution and carbon stock, role in the global climate, the impacts of direct human disturbances on carbon accumulation rates and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Based on the new peat extension and depth data, we estimate that tropical peatlands store 152-288 Gt C, or about half of the global peatland emitted carbon. We discuss the knowledge gaps in research on distribution, depth, C stock and fluxes in these ecosystems which play an important role in the global carbon cycle and risk releasing large quantities of GHGs into the atmosphere (CO2 and CH4) when subjected to anthropogenic interferences (e.g., drainage and deforestation). Recent studies show that although climate change has an impact on the carbon fluxes of these ecosystems, the direct anthropogenic disturbance may play a greater role. The future of these systems as carbon sinks will depend on advancing current scientific knowledge and incorporating local understanding to support policies geared toward managing and conserving peatlands in vulnerable regions, such as the Amazon where recent records show increased forest fires and deforestation.

TI  - High salinity suppresses nitrogen cycle genes and shifts nitrifier communities in the black mangrove rhizosphere
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
AB  - High salinity inhibits the nitrogen cycle, which is crucial to biogeochemical changes in coastal mangrove ecosystems. We examined Avicennia germinans rhizosphere soil over a salinity gradient (electrical conductivities of 5.27 mS cm- 1-38.64 mS cm-1) to see how high salinity affects the bacterial community and metabolic nitrogen activities. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene examined the bacterial population profile, whereas full shotgun metagenome sequencing assessed functional genetic potential. Bacillus, Desulfuromonas, Methyloceanibacter, and Nitrospira dominated the genera, whereas Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes dominated the phyla. Nitrospirae dominated at high salinity. High soil salinity suppressed nitrogen cycle gene abundances: nifH, nxrAB, nirS, nirK, norB, nirB, and nirA. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria like Nitrosococcus and Nitrosomonas decreased with salinity in the nitrifier population discovered by amplicon sequencing. Nitriteoxidizing bacteria like Nitrospira and Nitrospina rose at high salinity, whereas Nitrococcus and Nitrolancea declined. Salinity reduces nitrogen gene abundances in most nitrifier community members, inhibiting the nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Wildfire Impacts on Soil Microbiomes: Potential for Disruptions to Nitrogen-Cycling Bacteria
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
AB  - Wildfires have become increasingly common across the United States in recent decades, with significant implications for ecosystem health and sustainability. The viability and metabolic activity of soil bacteria are key for maintaining global nitrogen-cycling processes and are likely to be impacted as burn severity continues to increase. To this end, wildfire-affected soils were studied to examine the impact on nitrogen-cycling bacteria in soils affected by low, moderate, and high wildfire severities. This objective was achieved by characterizing soil bacterial communities in control (i.e., unburned) and burned soils collected one year following the Woolsey wildfire (Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, CA, USA) using Illumina MiSeq 16S sequencing and profiling nitrogen-cycling gene expression using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Six families and 17 genera were significantly (Spearman r(s) > |0.4|; p < 0.05) negatively associated with wildfire severity, and three families and six genera were significantly positively associated with wildfire severity. Many of these taxa contain species that are known to be critical contributors to maintaining global nitrogen cycles. NosZ and NirS nitrifying genes had significantly lower transcription rates in high-severity samples compared with control and low/moderate-severity samples. Collectively, these results suggest that high-severity wildfires significantly negatively alter the community structures and functions of nitrogen-cycling bacteria, which may have significant ramifications for ecosystem recovery in postwildfire landscapes.

TI  - Decomposition by ectomycorrhizal fungi alters soil carbon storage in a simulation model
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Carbon cycle models often lack explicit belowground organism activity, yet belowground organisms regulate carbon storage and release in soil. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are important players in the carbon cycle because they are a conduit into soil for carbon assimilated by the plant. It is hypothesized that ectomycorrhizal fungi can also be active decomposers when plant carbon allocation to fungi is low. Here, we reviewed the literature on ectomycorrhizal decomposition and we developed a simulation model of the plant-mycorrhizae interaction where a reduction in plant productivity stimulates ectomycorrhizal fungi to decompose soil organic matter. Our review highlights evidence demonstrating the potential for ectomycorrhizal fungi to decompose soil organic matter. Our model output suggests that ectomycorrhizal activity accounts for a portion of carbon decomposed in soil, but this portion varied with plant productivity and the mycorrhizal carbon uptake strategy simulated. Lower organic matter inputs to soil were largely responsible for reduced soil carbon storage. Using mathematical theory, we demonstrated that biotic interactions affect predictions of ecosystem functions. Specifically, we developed a simple function to model the mycorrhizal switch in function from plant symbiont to decomposer. We show that including mycorrhizal fungi with the flexibility of mutualistic and saprotrophic lifestyles alters predictions of ecosystem function.

TI  - Bioremediation potential of sulfadiazine-degrading bacteria: Impacts on ryegrass growth and soil functionality
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The extensive use of antibiotics, particularly sulfadiazine (SDZ), has led to significant environmental contamination and the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study investigates the bioremediation potential of two SDZ-degrading bacterial strains, Acinetobacter sp. M9 and Enterobacter sp. H1, and their impact on ryegrass (Lolium perenne) growth and the inter-root microenvironment in SDZ-contaminated soils. A pot experiment combined with amplicon and metagenomic sequencing revealed that inoculation with M9 and H1 significantly enhanced ryegrass growth by alleviating oxidative stress, increasing chlorophyll content, and improving soil nutrient availability. The strains also promoted SDZ degradation efficiency and improved carbon and nitrogen cycling through the upregulation of key functional genes. Furthermore, microbial community analysis demonstrated increased alpha diversity, shifts in dominant taxa, and functional enrichment in pollutant degradation pathways. The dynamics of ARGs revealed a decrease in aminoglycoside, rifamycin, and streptomycin resistance genes, while sulfonamide resistance genes increased due to the residual SDZ stress. These findings highlight the potential of M9 and H1 as sustainable bioremediation agents to mitigate antibiotic contamination, improve soil health, and support plant growth in polluted environments.

TI  - Plant genetic effects on soils under climate change
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - In the face of climate change, shifts in genetic structure and composition of terrestrial plant species are occurring worldwide. Because different genotypes of these plant species support different soil biota and soil processes, shifts in genetics are likely to have cascading effects on ecosystems.
   We explore plant genetic effects on soil function in the context of climate change, and selection by soils, soil biota and plant-soil feedbacks. We propose categories of genetically-based plant traits that should be prioritized in research on genetic-based effects on soil processes including plant productivity and C allocation, tissue quality, plant water-use, and rhizosphere mutualisms. Additionally, we posit that soil community responses to climate change should be considered in concert with plant genotype because of sensitivity of soil communities to climate. We use two case studies to highlight these points.
   We argue that the effects of climate change as an agent of selection on plants may cascade to affect soils, and ultimately the structure, composition and function of ecosystems. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary potential of plant-soil linkages may help us understand and mitigate the extended consequences of global change for ecosystems worldwide. Accordingly, we conclude with experimental approaches for examining genetically-based plant-soil interactions across climate change gradients.

TI  - Trophic cascade alters ecosystem carbon exchange
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Trophic cascades-the indirect effects of carnivores on plants mediated by herbivores-are common across ecosystems, but their influence on biogeochemical cycles, particularly the terrestrial carbon cycle, are largely unexplored. Here, using a C-13 pulse-chase experiment, we demonstrate how trophic structure influences ecosystem carbon dynamics in a meadow system. By manipulating the presence of herbivores and predators, we show that even without an initial change in total plant or herbivore biomass, the cascading effects of predators in this system begin to affect carbon cycling through enhanced carbon fixation by plants. Prolonged cascading effects on plant biomass lead to slowing of carbon loss via ecosystem respiration and reallocation of carbon among plant aboveground and belowground tissues. Consequently, up to 1.4-fold more carbon is retained in plant biomass when carnivores are present compared with when they are absent, owing primarily to greater carbon storage in grass and belowground plant biomass driven largely by predator nonconsumptive (fear) effects on herbivores. Our data highlight the influence that the mere presence of predators, as opposed to direct consumption of herbivores, can have on carbon uptake, allocation, and retention in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Microbial characteristics and CO2 diffuse emission in the Mt. Changbai volcanic field, northeast China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES
AB  - Volcanism is one of the principal geologic processes that drive the transferring of carbon between interior and surface reservoirs, playing a crucial role in climate change and global warming. Clarifying the relationship between the characteristics of microorganisms and geological degassing of dormant volcanoes is one of the most important and fundamental tasks. In this study, the microbial characteristics (including bacteria, archaea, and fungi) of cold and hot springs and soil in the Tianchi volcano (TCV), northeastern China were comprehensively studied. Results of this study indicated that the microbial diversities of water environments (hot and cold springs) exhibited distinct characteristics compared to that of the soil, inferring that the microbial-driven carbon cycle in wet and dry degassing systems in the TCV are different. The CO2 diffuse emission flux from the soil through micro-seepage decreased from the crater to the peripheral area, which broadly coincided with the diversity and richness of the microbial community. A moderate but significant correlation was found between soil CO2 flux and microbial diversity of bacteria, archaea and fungi, differing from that observed in extreme volcanic environments and non-volcanic fields. This study is the first to report the correlation between microbial community diversity and soil CO2 flux in a non-extreme volcanic environment. The findings reveal the diversity of microorganisms involved in the carbon cycle, which may provide a foundation for further in-depth exploration of the intrinsic microbial mechanisms in the carbon cycle.

TI  - Extreme precipitation alters soil nitrogen cycling related microbial community in karst abandoned farmland
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Precipitation varies significantly in the southwest China karst regions, with a significant increase in the number of years with abnormally low precipitation during the rainy season and longer dry periods. Soil moisture and nitrogen chemical patterns are the main limiting factors for plant growth in this region. However, there are fewer studies on the impact of extreme precipitation on soil nitrogen cycling in abandoned farmland in karst ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the effects of changes in precipitation frequency and single precipitation amount on the nitrogen-cycle related microbial community in karst abandoned farmland through a two-year precipitation manipulation experiment. Our results showed that more frequent, smaller precipitation events increased soil water content, alleviating water limitation in karst abandoned farmland and resulting in higher abundance of functional genes (nosZ, nrtABCD, gltBD, and gdhB), which accelerated soil nitrogen turnover compared to natural precipitation (Control). The changes in the gene abundance were associated with shifts in the dominant microbial taxa, such as Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. In addition, nitrogen-cycling microbial communities exhibited resistance and resilience to extreme precipitation conditions. These findings shed light on the influence of precipitation regimes changes on soil nitrogen cycling in karst abandoned farmland, offering valuable insights for predicting the ecosystem's response to future precipitation changes.

TI  - Nitrogen deposition stimulated winter nitrous oxide emissions from bare sand more than biological soil crusts in cold desert ecosystem
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Dryland ecosystems are often nitrogen-limited, and small nitrogen inputs may produce large responses to dryland ecological processes, such as gaseous nitrogen emission. The effect of increased anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on N2O and NO emissions in desert ecosystems is unclear, especially in non-growing seasons when the surface is covered with snow. In this study, nitrogen applications were performed on biological soil crusts (lichen crust and moss crust, bare sand for control) in the Gurbantunggut Desert, Northwest China. We measured the fluxes of N2O and NO and related nitrogen cycle functional gene abundances in winter for three-years period. Nitrogen addition significantly affected N2O emissions and increased the abundances of key functional gene for nitrogen cycle, while it only slightly influenced NO emissions. These effects of nitrogen addition depended on composition of biological soil crusts. For bare sand and lichen crust, nitrogen addition significantly increased N2O emissions, whereas for moss crust, only a negligible effect was observed. Meanwhile, significant differences in nitrogen cycle functional gene abundances were found among different composition of biological soil crusts. Abundance of amoA, narG, and nosZ genes were highly related to N2O and NO emissions. Thus, our results indicate that gaseous nitrogen emissions were generally increased by nitrogen addition through their effects on related functional microbial groups. The effects were regulated by composition of biological soil crusts which can buffer the effects of increasing nitrogen addition during winter.

TI  - Biosolids amendment effects on nitrogen cycling gene expression by the soil prokaryotic community as revealed by metatranscriptomic analysis
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Context Large quantities of treated sewage sludge (biosolids) are produced and beneficially applied to agricultural fields to improve soil fertility in many countries. Biosolids have extremely high concentrations of ammonium and organic matter that can be beneficial but also detrimental to the environment by promoting microbially-mediated reactions that contribute to eutrophication and greenhouse gas emission.Aims The hypothesis of the study was that high concentrations of ammonium and labile organic matter in biosolids would significantly affect nitrogen transformations and nitrogen-cycling gene expression by different members of the prokaryotic community in a biosolids-amended agricultural soil.Methods An organically-managed agricultural soil was amended with biosolids and monitored for changes in carbon dioxide and inorganic nitrogen species for 3 weeks under laboratory conditions. Then, RNA was extracted and compared for nitrogen-cycling gene expression levels in biosolids-amended and unamended soil.Key results Biosolids amendment significantly increased ammonium concentration and decreased oxygen and nitrate concentrations in soil zones near biosolid particles, which coincided with significant changes in expression levels of genes for catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase, nitrification enzymes, denitrifying enzymes, and numerous other enzymes by different members of the prokaryotic community.Conclusions The application of biosolids to soil set in motion a dynamic organic nitrogen mineralisation-nitrification-denitrification cycle between the anaerobic biosolids zone and aerobic soil zone.Implications Biosolids-induced changes in nitrogen transformations by different members of the microbial community have implications on nitrogen availability/toxicity to nitrifying populations and plants, ammonium and nitrate in surface runoff, and nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emission from biosolids-amended soil.
   Treated sewage sludge (biosolids) is often applied to agricultural fields, home lawns/gardens, and golf courses to improve soil fertility. Biosolids have extremely high concentrations of ammonium and organic matter that could adversely affect soil, water, and air quality. Biosolids amendment set in motion a dynamic organic nitrogen mineralisation-nitrification-denitrification cycle that greatly affected nitrogen availability, fate, and transport in the environment.

TI  - Antarctic permafrost degassing in Taylor Valley by extensive soil gas investigation
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Ongoing studies conducted in northern polar regions reveal that permafrost stability plays a key role in the modern carbon cycle as it potentially stores considerable quantities of greenhouse gases. Rapid and recent warming of the Arc-tic permafrost is resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions, both from physical and microbial processes. The po-tential impact of greenhouse gas release from the Antarctic region has not, to date, been investigated. In Antarctica, the McMurdo Dry Valleys comprise 10 % of the ice-free soil surface areas in Antarctica and like the northern polar regions are also warming albeit at a slower rate.The work presented herein examines a comprehensive sample suite of soil gas (e.g., CO2, CH4 and He) concentrations and CO2 flux measurements conducted in Taylor Valley during austral summer 2019/2020. Analytical results reveal the presence of significant concentrations of CO2, CH4 and He (up to 3.44 vol%, 18,447 ppmv and 6.49 ppmv, respec-tively) at the base of the active layer. When compared with the few previously obtained measurements, we observe increased CO2 flux rates (estimated CO2 emissions in the study area of 21.6 km2 approximate to 15 tons day-1). We suggest that the gas source is connected with the deep brines migrating from inland (potentially from beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet) towards the coast beneath the permafrost layer. These data provide a baseline for future investigations aimed at monitoring the changing rate of greenhouse gas emissions from Antarctic permafrost, and the potential origin of gases, as the southern polar region warms.

TI  - Rice biomass production and carbon cycling in 13CO2 pulse-labeled microcosms with different soils under submerged conditions
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Rice fields are an important source for the greenhouse gas methane. Plants play an essential role in carbon supply for soil microbiota, but the influence of the microbial community on carbon cycling is not well understood.
   Microcosms were prepared using sand-vermiculite amended with different soils and sediments, and planted with rice. The microcosms at different growth stages were pulse-labeled with (CO2)-C-13 followed by tracing C-13 in plant, soil and atmospheric carbon pools and quantifying the abundance of methanogenic archaea in rhizosphere soil.
   Overall, > 85 % of the freshly assimilated carbon was allocated in aboveground plant biomass, approximately 10 % was translocated into the roots and < 2 % was recovered in soil organic matter, independently from soil type. Only about 0.3 % was transformed to CH4, but emission of C-13-labeled CH4 started immediately and C-13 enrichment revealed that plant-derived carbon was an important source for methanogenesis. The results further demonstrated that carbon assimilation and translocation processes, microbial abundance and gas emission were not only affected by the plant growth stage, but also by the content and type of soil in which the rice plants grew.
   The study illustrates the close ties between plant physiology, soil properties and microbial communities for carbon turnover and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Cattle grazing drives nitrogen and carbon cycling in a temperate salt marsh
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - We examined the impact of long-term cattle grazing on soil processes and microbial activity in a temperate salt marsh. Soil conditions, microbial biomass and respiration, mineralization and denitrification rates were measured in upper salt marsh that had been ungrazed or cattle grazed for several decades. Increased microbial biomass and soil respiration were observed in grazed marsh, most likely stimulated by enhanced rates of root turnover and root exudation. We found a significant positive effect of grazing on potential N mineralization rates measured in the laboratory, but this difference did not translate to in situ net mineralization measured monthly from May to September. Rates of denitrification were lowest in the grazed marsh and appeared to be limited by nitrate availability, possibly due to more anoxic conditions and lower rates of nitrification. The major effect of grazing on N cycling therefore appeared to be in limiting losses of N through denitrification, which may lead to enhanced nutrient availability to saltmarsh plants, but a reduced ability of the marsh to act as a buffer for land-derived nutrients to adjacent coastal areas. Additionally, we investigated if grazing influences the rates of turnover of labile and refractory C in saltmarsh soils by adding (14)C-labelled leaf litter or root exudates to soil samples and monitoring the evolution of (14)CO(2). Grazing had little effect on the rates of mineralization of (14)C used as a respiratory substrate, but a larger proportion of (14)C was partitioned into microbial biomass and immobilized in long- and medium-term storage pools in the grazed treatment. Grazing slowed down the turnover of the microbial biomass, which resulted in longer turnover times for both leaf litter and root exudates. Grazing may therefore affect the longevity of C in the soil and alter C storage and utilization pathways in the microbial community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of post-fire salvage logging on microbial nitrogen cyclers in Mediterranean forest soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Forest fires are a regular occurrence in the Mediterranean basin. High severity fires and post-fire management can affect biological, chemical and physical properties of soil, including the composition and abundance of soil microbial communities. Salvage logging is a post-fire management strategy, which involves the removal of burnt wood from land after a fire. The main objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of post-fire salvage logging and microaggregation on soil microbial communities, specifically on the abundance of nitrogen cyclers and, thus, the potential of the soil for microbial nitrogen cycling. The abundance of nitrogen cyclers was assessed by quantification of microbial nitrogen cycling genes in soil DNA, including nifH (involved in nitrogen fixation), nirS/K and nosZ (involved in denitrification), amoA-B and amoA-Arch (involved in bacterial and archaeal nitrification, respectively). It was demonstrated that salvage logging reduced bacterial load post-fire when compared to tree retention control and resulted in significant changes to the abundance of functional bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling. Microbial gene pools involved in various stages of the nitrogen cycle were larger in control soil than in soil subjected to post-fire salvage logging and were significantly correlated with organic matter, available phosphorous, nitrogen and aggregate stability. The microaggregate fraction of the soil, which has been associated with greater organic carbon, was shown to be a hotspot for nitrogen cyclers particularly under salvage logging. The impact of post-fire management strategies on soil microbial communities needs to be considered in relation to maintaining ecosystem productivity, resilience and potential impact on climate change.

TI  - Carbon Cycling in Global Drylands
T2  - CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review The aim of this paper is to describe the carbon cycle in drylands in relation to the processes, factors, and causes affecting it. A specific focus is placed on both biotic and abiotic mechanisms of carbon sequestration in drylands in relation to mitigation of the anthropogenic climate change.
   Recent Findings Global dryland area is increasing along with an increase in risks of desertification, salinization, and eolian/hydrologic processes of accelerated soil erosion with strong impacts on the carbon cycle. Nonetheless, drylands contribute strongly towards the land-based sink of the atmospheric carbon dioxide through sequestration of carbon in the soil, ground water, and biomass. Thus, dryland ecosystems affect inter-annual variability in the global carbon cycle and create a negative feedback through carbon sequestration.
   Summary Global drylands, covering 66.7 M km(2) or 45.36% of the Earth's land area, strongly impact the ecosystem carbon stock, contribute to the land-based carbon sink, and provide a negative feedback to the global carbon cycle. Whereas the net primary productivity is limited by the water scarcity, especially in hyper-arid and arid ecoregions, sequestration of inorganic carbon in soil and ground water is an important control of the carbon cycle. Desertification, caused by eolian and hydrologic erosion along with salinization, must be controlled and reversed to enhance carbon sequestration, achieve land degradation neutrality, and create a negative feedback. Carbon sequestration strategy recognizes "soil" as a rights holder to be protected,restored and naturally evolve.

TI  - Cadaverine and putrescine exposure influence carbon and nitrogen cycling genes in water and sediment of the Yellow River
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - The response patterns of microbial functional genes involved in biogeochemical cycles to cadaver decay is a central topic of recent environmental sciences. However, the response mechanisms and pathways of the functional genes associated with the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling to cadaveric substances such as cadaverine and putrescine remain unclear. This study explored the variation of functional genes associated with C fixation, C degradation and N cycling and their influencing factors under cadaverine, putrescine and mixed treatments. Our results showed only putrescine significantly increased the alpha diversity of C fixation genes, while reducing the alpha diversity of N cycling genes in sediment. For the C cycling, the mixed treatment significantly decreased the total abundance of reductive acetyl-CoA pathway genes (i.e., acsB and acsE) and lig gene linked to lignin degradation in water, while only significantly increasing the hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutylate cycle (i.e., accA) gene abundance in sediment. For the N cycling, mixed treatment significantly decreased the abundance of the nitrification (i.e., amoB), denitrification (i.e., nirS3) genes in water and the assimilation pathway gene (i.e., gdhA) in sediment. Environmental factors (i.e., total carbon and total nitrogen) were all negatively associated with the genes of C and N cycling. Therefore, cadaverine and putrescine exposure may inhibit the pathway in C fixation and N cycling, while promoting C degradation. These findings can offer some new insight for the management of amine pollution caused by animal cadavers. (c) 2024 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Effects of returning peach branch waste to fields on soil carbon cycle mediated by soil microbial communities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - In recent years, the rise in greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture has worsened climate change. Efficiently utilizing agricultural waste can significantly mitigate these effects. This study investigated the ecological benefits of returning peach branch waste to fields (RPBF) through three innovative strategies: (1) application of peach branch organic fertilizer (OF), (2) mushroom cultivation using peach branches as a substrate (MC), and (3) surface mulching with peach branches (SM). Conducted within a peach orchard ecosystem, our research aimed to assess these resource utilization strategies' effects on soil properties, microbial community, and carbon cycle, thereby contributing to sustainable agricultural practices. Our findings indicated that all RPBF treatments enhance soil nutrient content, enriching beneficial microorganisms, such as Humicola, Rhizobiales, and Bacillus. Moreover, soil AP and AK were observed to regulate the soil carbon cycle by altering the compositions and functions of microbial communities. Notably, OF and MC treatments were found to boost autotrophic microorganism abundance, thereby augmenting the potential for soil carbon sequestration and emission reduction. Interestingly, in peach orchard soil, fungal communities were found to contribute more greatly to SOC content than bacterial communities. However, SM treatment resulted in an increase in the presence of bacterial communities, thereby enhancing carbon emissions. Overall, this study illustrated the fundamental pathways by which RPBF treatment affects the soil carbon cycle, providing novel insights into the rational resource utilization of peach branch waste and the advancement of ecological agriculture.

TI  - Solar and water-induced lignin degradation: Catalyzing the acceleration of plant biomass carbon cycling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB  - Photodegradation is an important factor that affects the terrestrial carbon cycle. Lignin is a main component of plant biomass, easily and selectively undergoes photodegradation. Moreover, lignin provides key information that is essential for studying photodegradation of plant biomass. Enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (EHL) was used in a novel investigation of photodegradation of plant biomass in the presence of various quantities of sprayed water. The EHL specimen without sprayed water exhibited obvious photooxidation, cleavage and depolymerization under ultraviolet radiation; its C and H contents declined; its residue yield increased by 1.00 %; and its O/C ratio, C4, and O2 growth rates based on X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy increased by 15.15 %, 27.11 %, and 132.09 %, respectively. Water has been shown to play an important role in lignin photodegradation, with a moderate amount resulting in the highest oxidation degree. Importantly, photodegradation of lignin accelerates the return of fixated carbon to the atmosphere. EHL sprayed 0.46 g g- 1 water exhibited an obvious decrease in C (-2.64 %), C1s (-6.89 %), C1 (-12.53 %), and C2 (- 19.92 %) content after 320 h of UV exposure. This study provides a new perspective to further understand the effects of plant biomass photodegradation on terrestrial carbon cycling.

TI  - Recent advances in the research on effects of micro/nanoplastics on carbon conversion and carbon cycle: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Massive production and spread application of plastics have led to the accumulation of numerous plastics in the global environment so that the proportion of carbon storage in these polymers also increases. Carbon cycle is of fundamental significance to global climate change and human survival and development. With the continuous increase of microplastics, undoubtedly, there carbons will continue to be introduced into the global carbon cycle. In this paper, the impact of microplastics on microorganisms involved in carbon transformation is reviewed. Micro/nanoplastics affect carbon conversion and carbon cycle by interfering with biological fixation of CO2, microbial structure and community, functional enzymes activity, the expression of related genes, and the change of local environment. Micro/nanoplastic abundance, concentration and size could significantly lead to difference in carbon conversion. In addition, plastic pollution can further affect the blue carbon ecosystem reduce its ability to store CO2 and marine carbon fixation capacity. Nevertheless, problematically, limited information is seriously insufficient in understanding the relevant mechanisms. Accordingly, it is required to further explore the effect of micro/nanoplastics and derived organic carbon on carbon cycle under multiple impacts. Under the influence of global change, migration and transformation of these carbon substances may cause new ecological and envi-ronmental problems. Additionally, the relationship between plastic pollution and blue carbon ecosystem and global climate change should be timely established. This work provides a better perspective for the follow-up study of the impact of micro/nanoplastics on carbon cycle.

TI  - A CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK TO LINK CARBON AND NITROGEN CYCLING TO SOIL-STRUCTURE FORMATION
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - A productive soil needs a favorable structure and an efficient nutrient cycling system. Management practices which simultaneously enhance these functions can lead to sustainable land use. The objective of this study was to develop concepts which can be used to link C and N cycling and soil structure formation by using the following model: (1) each organism produces cell structures which are resistant to decomposition. The amount of resistant material contributing to soil structure formation depends upon the size and turnover of the organism; (2) each organism contributes to mineralization of C and N as well as soil structure formation simultaneously, i.e. a portion of C and N during each trophic transfer is used for C and N cycling and a portion is used for soil structure formation. Using the data from the literature and our laboratory, I have: (1) described the structure of organisms; (2) linked the structure of organisms to C and N cycling through soil food webs and to the formation of stabilized soil organic matter; (3) described faunal effects on soil structure; (4) suggested ways to integrate C and N cycling and soil structure formation in current simulation models. The major limitation of current models describing soil ;organic matter dynamics is the lack of description of the formation of aggregates and alteration of porosity through plant root and faunal activity. The availability of fluorescence and micromorphological techniques for in situ visual inspection of soil microenvironments, and three dimensional imaging and modeling techniques, may provide essential data for a sound understanding of the soil matrix effects on microbial growth, microbial-faunal dynamics, fecal material deposition, and formation of macropores in soils and aid in integrating C and N cycling and soil structure formation. This knowledge can be used to develop management systems which enhance soil structure formation, increase the efficiency of C and N cycling, and lead to the development of sustainable land use practices.

TI  - Key genes of electron transfer, the nitrogen cycle and tetracycline removal in bioelectrochemical systems
T2  - BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS
AB  - BackgroundSoil microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can remove antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) simultaneously, but their removal mechanism is unclear. In this study, metagenomic analysis was employed to reveal the functional genes involved in degradation, electron transfer and the nitrogen cycle in the soil MFC.ResultsThe results showed that the soil MFC effectively removed tetracycline in the overlapping area of the cathode and anode, which was 64% higher than that of the control. The ARGs abundance increased by 14% after tetracycline was added (54% of the amplified ARGs belonged to efflux pump genes), while the abundance decreased by 17% in the soil MFC. Five potential degraders of tetracycline were identified, especially the species Phenylobacterium zucineum, which could secrete the 4-hydroxyacetophenone monooxygenase encoded by EC 1.14.13.84 to catalyse deacylation or decarboxylation. Bacillus, Geobacter, Anaerolinea, Gemmatirosa kalamazoonesis and Steroidobacter denitrificans since ubiquinone reductase (encoded by EC 1.6.5.3), succinate dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.5.1), Coenzyme Q-cytochrome c reductase (EC 1.10.2.2), cytochrome-c oxidase (EC 1.9.3.1) and electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.5.5.1) served as complexes I, II, III, IV and ubiquinone, respectively, to accelerate electron transfer. Additionally, nitrogen metabolism-related gene abundance increased by 16% to support the microbial efficacy in the soil MFC, and especially EC 1.7.5.1, and coding the mutual conversion between nitrite and nitrate was obviously improved.ConclusionsThe soil MFC promoted functional bacterial growth, increased functional gene abundance (including nitrogen cycling, electron transfer, and biodegradation), and facilitated antibiotic and ARG removal. Therefore, soil MFCs have expansive prospects in the remediation of antibiotic-contaminated soil. This study provides insight into the biodegradation mechanism at the gene level in soil bioelectrochemical remediation.

TI  - Mariculture Sludge Modifies Archaeal Community Diversity, Reduces Archaeal Variability, and Enhances Nitrogen Cycling Capacity in Paddy Soil
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Given the increasing nitrogen losses in paddy soils associated with rice cultivation, this study employed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to investigate the effects of different concentrations of mariculture sludge on archaeal communities and nitrogen-cycling microorganisms. Mariculture sludge can enhance the alpha diversity of archaeal communities in paddy soil. The relative abundances of numerous archaeal taxa, such as Euryarchaeota and Woesearchaeota, were markedly higher in soils with the application of mariculture sludge than in those without mariculture sludge treatment, and the taxonomical distribution was significantly correlated with salinity, pH, NH4+, PO43- and TN. In terms of microecology, the application of mariculture sludge to paddy soil influenced the assembly of the archaeal community through deterministic processes; the average variation degree of the archaeal community decreased; and the predicted archaeal functions shifted toward nucleoside and nucleotide synthesis, amino acid synthesis, and carbohydrate synthesis. Mariculture sludge application resulted in a significant increase in the abundance of the mcrA gene (methane production) and decreases in the abundance of the amoA, pmoA, and mmoX genes (methane metabolism). Overall, mariculture sludge application enriched the archaeal community, reduced archaeal community variability and increased the potential for nitrogen cycling and biosynthesis in paddy soils. These results offer insights into the potential of mariculture sludge as an organic amendment for sustainable soil management, although further study is needed to assess its long-term effects on greenhouse gas emissions in paddy soil ecosystems.

TI  - Combined Application of Organic Materials Improves Soil Properties and Promotes Soil Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The combined application of organic materials can improve soil performance and crop growth, but the influence of diverse organic materials on soil microbes and nitrogen cycle-related genes remain obscure. In this study, chemical fertilizer (MC), chemical fertilizer with biochar (MCB), chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer (MCF), and chemical fertilizer with biochar and organic fertilizer (MCBF) were applied to a field experiment of maize cultivation, and their roles on soil properties, microbial community structure, and nitrogen cycling was determined by metagenomic sequencing technology combined with redundancy analysis (RDA) and correlation analysis. The results showed that pH decreased in co-application compared with MC, whereas the available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and organic matter (AN, AP, AK, OM) elevated, especially in MCF and MCBF. Crop yield and the content of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen also elevated in both MCF and MCBF, whereas they all decreased in MCB. The phylum Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were dominant under all treatments. The abundance of hao, nxrB, narG, nirK, norB, nirS, narB, and nosZ increased in co-application, thereby promoting ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The abundance of nasA, napA, nirB, and nifH increased in MCB, but decreased in MCF and MCBF. RDA and correlation analysis revealed that the majority of nitrogen-cycling genes decreased with pH and increased with other environmental factors. In conclusion, under the premise of guaranteeing yield, the MCBF was the optimal choice to soil quality and nitrogen cycle-related microorganisms.

TI  - Effects of different land use on functional genes of soil microbial carbon and phosphorus cycles in the desert steppe zone of the Loess Plateau
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Desert grassland ecosystems on China's Loess Plateau are characterized by diverse land use types and varying human disturbances. We aimed to evaluate how land use influences soil microbial communities and functional genes related to carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) cycling. To do this, we selected five representative land use types: natural grassland, 20-year abandoned farmland, 12-year alfalfa grassland, 5-year Lanzhou lily farmland, and 17-year Platycladus orientalis forest. High-throughput metagenomic sequencing and soil physicochemical analyses were conducted. Proteobacteria dominated the nutrient-rich lily soil, while Actinobacteria were more abundant in the other soils. Available phosphorus (AP) had the strongest influence on microbial community structure and gene composition (p < 0.01). The relative abundance of ppdK, rpiB, glpX, and epi (C fixation genes), and purS (purine metabolism) was significantly higher in forest soil than in abandoned farmland (p < 0.05). Similarly, forest soil showed elevated levels of mttB and acs (methanogenesis), sdhA (TCA cycle), pstS (P transport), and pps (pyruvate metabolism) compared to alfalfa soil. Lily soil exhibited significantly higher abundance of acr genes (involved in the hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutylate cycle) and phnE (an ATP-binding cassette transporter) than natural grassland and alfalfa soils (p < 0.05). Microbial networks involved in C and P cycling were simpler but more functionally specialized in forest soil. Positive microbial interactions related to C and P cycling were strongest in lily soil. These findings provide important insights into soil microbial functional adaptation and offer a foundation for sustainable land use management on the Loess Plateau.

TI  - The changing global carbon cycle: linking plant-soil carbon dynamics to global consequences
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Most current climate-carbon cycle models that include the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle are based on a model developed 40 years ago by Woodwell & Whittaker (1968) and omit advances in biogeochemical understanding since that time. Their model treats net C emissions from ecosystems as the balance between net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR, i.e. primarily decomposition).
   Under conditions near steady state, geographic patterns of decomposition closely match those of NPP, and net C emissions are adequately described as a simple balance of NPP and HR (the Woodwell-Whittaker model). This close coupling between NPP and HR occurs largely because of tight coupling between C and N (nitrogen) cycles and because NPP constrains the food available to heterotrophs.
   Processes in addition to NPP and HR become important to understanding net C emissions from ecosystems under conditions of rapid changes in climate, hydrology, atmospheric CO2, land cover, species composition and/or N deposition. Inclusion of these processes in climate-C cycle models would improve their capacity to simulate recent and future climatic change.
   Processes that appear critical to soil C dynamics but warrant further research before incorporation into ecosystem models include below-ground C flux and its partitioning among roots, mycorrhizas and exudates; microbial community effects on C sequestration; and the effects of temperature and labile C on decomposition. The controls over and consequences of these processes are still unclear at the ecosystem scale.
   Carbon fluxes in addition to NPP and HR exert strong influences over the climate system under conditions of rapid change. These fluxes include methane release, wildfire, and lateral transfers of food and fibre among ecosystems.
   Water and energy exchanges are important complements to C cycle feedbacks to the climate system, particularly under non-steady-state conditions. An integrated understanding of multiple ecosystem-climate feedbacks provides a strong foundation for policies to mitigate climate change.
   Synthesis. Current climate systems models that include only NPP and HR are inadequate under conditions of rapid change. Many of the recent advances in biogeochemical understanding are sufficiently mature to substantially improve representation of ecosystem C dynamics in these models.

TI  - Mechanistic insights into the influences of photovoltaic panel construction on algal crust microbial communities in alpine desert grasslands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) park construction has a profound impact on the regional microclimate and ecosystem carbon cycle. Meanwhile, biological soil crusts (BSCs) also play a crucial role in the carbon and nitrogen cycles of desert ecosystems. However, the response mechanism of algal BSC microbial communities to PV panel construction is still poorly elucidated. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was utilized to explore the mechanism underlying the effects of PV panel construction on algal BSC microbial communities in the Talatan PV Base. The results showed that the predominant bacterial phyla of algal BSCs in desert grassland were Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria. PV panel construction changed the structure of algal BSC bacterial communities, which significantly increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and enhanced the interconnectivity between bacterial species. Nevertheless, the response of bacterial community diversity to the construction of PV panels was not significant (P > 0.05). PV panel construction altered the microenvironment by significantly increasing temperatures under the panels while significantly reducing soil carbon stocks. In addition, temperature and carbon content were the most important factors influencing the structure and diversity of algal BSC bacterial communities in alpine desert grasslands. In summary, the installation of photovoltaic panels led to a notable elevation in the temperature underneath them. This temperature increase, in turn, enhanced the stability of the bacterial communities within the algal BSC in alpine desert grasslands. Simultaneously, it significantly reduced the carbon storage capacity in these grasslands, thus exerting a dual-edged impact on the ecological environment of the region.

TI  - Ecology of Nitrogen Fixing, Nitrifying, and Denitrifying Microorganisms in Tropical Forest Soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil microorganisms play important roles in nitrogen cycling within forest ecosystems. Current research has revealed that a wider variety of microorganisms, with unexpected diversity in their functions and phylogenies, are involved in the nitrogen cycle than previously thought, including nitrogen-fixing bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea, heterotrophic nitrifying microorganisms, and anammox bacteria, as well as denitrifying bacteria, archaea, and fungi. However, the vast majority of this research has been focused in temperate regions, and relatively little is known regarding the ecology of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms within tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Tropical forests are characterized by relatively high precipitation, low annual temperature fluctuation, high heterogeneity in plant diversity, large amounts of plant litter, and unique soil chemistry. For these reasons, regulation of the nitrogen cycle in tropical forests may be very different from that of temperate ecosystems. This is of great importance because of growing concerns regarding the effect of land use change and chronic elevated nitrogen deposition on nitrogen-cycling processes in tropical forests. In the context of global change, it is crucial to understand how environmental factors and land use changes in tropical ecosystems influence the composition, abundance and activity of key players in the nitrogen cycle. In this review, we synthesize the limited currently available information regarding the microbial communities involved in nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification, to provide deeper insight into the mechanisms regulating nitrogen cycling in tropical forest ecosystems. We also highlight the large gaps in our understanding of microbially mediated nitrogen processes in tropical forest soils and identify important areas for future research.

TI  - Effects of short-term drought, nitrogen application and their interactions on the composition and functional genes of soil microbial communities in alfalfa grassland on the Loess Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Drought and nitrogen addition are important factors influencing soil microorganisms and changes in the soil environment. In the future, droughts will become more frequent, shorter, and more severe. However, little is known about the soil organic carbon components, enzyme activity, and composition, structure, and functional genes of soil microbial communities under short-term drought and nitrogen application conditions. In this study, we used metagenomics sequencing technology to explore the changes in the composition and functional genes of soil microbial communities under short-term drought, nitrogen application, and their interactions in the artificial grasslands of the Loess Plateau. The results indicated that (I) short-term drought, nitrogen application, and their interactions all increased the particulate organic carbon (POC) content. (II) Short-term drought increased the contents of soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), as well as soil enzyme activity. (III) Short-term drought significantly increased the bacterial alpha diversity, whereas the interactions of short-term drought and nitrogen application enhanced the fungal alpha diversity. (IV) The interactions of short-term drought and nitrogen application inhibited Fusarium to prevent plant diseases. (V) Short-term drought enriched the relative abundance of genes related to carbon cycling and amino acid metabolism, while nitrogen application reduced genes related to carbon cycling but enriched genes related to glycan biosynthesis and metabolism. These results clearly showed that, short-term drought altered the composition and functional genes of soil microbial communities. Our research suggests that in the event of frequent short-term droughts in the future, nitrogen addition can be considered to maintain the diversity of soil microbial communities and sustain soil carbon and nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Impact of soil inoculation on crop residue breakdown and carbon and nitrogen cycling in organically and conventionally managed agricultural soils
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Organic agriculture relies on organic fertilizers and amendments to provide nutrients to plants and will therefore depend on decomposer communities to release nutrients from these organic inputs. However, after conversion of conventional to organic agriculture it may take up to decades before decomposer communities become adapted to the new resource inputs. The aim of the present study is to investigate if the functional capacity of soil communities for decomposing recalcitrant crop residue types can be enhanced by inoculating soil communities from organically into conventionally managed soils. We used a microcosm incubation experiment to test how soil inoculation, agricultural management history, and crop residue type affect carbon and nitrogen cycling with crop residue addition. We collected soil samples from 5 pairs of conventional and nearby organic fields and set up a reciprocal inoculation experiment under controlled lab conditions. We inoculated soil from each conventional field with soil from the paired organic field and vice versa. To each soil mix, five types of crop residues were added: a cover crop mixture, carrot leaves (Daucus carota), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), hay (Lolium perenne), and straw (Triticum aestivum). There was one control treatment without any addition. Soils were incubated for 34 days and we measured mass loss of the crop residues from litter bags, cumulative soil respiration, cumulative potential plant available nutrients, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), and substrate-induced respiration (SIR). Initial soil abiotic conditions (soil organic matter content, pH, C:N ratio, plant available nutrients), soil microbial biomass and soil bacterial and fungal community composition were also determined. We did not find clear effects of inoculation on mass loss and cumulative respiration. Instead, effects of crop residue type on all parameters were substantial. Crop residues with higher C:N ratios generally had lower mass loss and cumulative respiration, and resulted in lower nitrogen availability but higher POXC contents. Organic management enhanced cumulative respiration. There was little overlap in bacterial and fungal ASVs between the organic and conventional soils within each pair, resulting in a potential increase in diversity as a result of soil inoculation. We conclude that decomposition of crop residues declined with their recalcitrance, and that soils from organically managed fields did not increase the capacity of the soil community to decompose recalcitrant residues. Further studies are needed to determine whether compositional differences between soils from organic and conventional fields are a response to farming practices or whether management also has functional implications for soil fertility.

TI  - Recent advances in impacts of microplastics on nitrogen cycling in the environment: A review
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Nitrogen cycling plays a decisive role in biogeochemistry, and largely depends on microbial driven nitrogen transformation. The environmental problems caused by microplastics are becoming more serious, and the analysis and control of its pollution in the environment have become a research hotspot in the field. The nitrogen transformation and nitrogen cycling in the environment are mainly driven by microorganisms in the environment, and the existence of microplastics can affect the microbial population, abundance and type, thus affecting the transformation of nitrogen. The effect of microplastics on microorganisms involved in nitrogen transformation is briefly described. This paper mainly reviews the research progress on the impacts of microplastics on nitrogen transformation and nitrogen cycling in water, soil, sediment and sewage sludge. Microplastic type, size and concentration can cause obvious difference in the impacts of microplastics on nitrogen transformation. Then, response and mechanism of microplastics to microorganism mediated nitrogen transformation and nitrogen cycling are introduced. Processes of nitrogen transformation are affected by interfering with microorganism diversity and structure, enzyme activities and related coding genes and oxygen flux. Additionally, additives released from microplastics can also affect the microbial activity. However, mechanisms of microplastics on environmental nitrogen transformation and nitrogen cycling are not fully understood due to the lack of relevant research. There are effective strategies to evaluate complex environmental systems, prolong action time, strengthen multi factor and multi-level research, and assist molecular biology and stable isotope technology. This review article can provide valuable insights into the impact of microplastics on microorganisms mediated nitrogen transformation processes and evaluate the impact on ecological and environmental health.

TI  - Bacterial quorum sensing and nitrogen cycling in rhizosphere soil
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Plant photosynthate fuels carbon-limited microbial growth and activity, resulting in increased rhizosphere nitrogen (N) mineralization. Most soil organic nitrogen is macromolecular (chitin, protein, nucleotides); enzymatic depolymerization is likely rate limiting for plant nitrogen accumulation. Analyzing Avena (wild oat) planted in microcosms containing sieved field soil, we observed increased rhizosphere chitinase and protease-specific activities, bacterial cell densities, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) compared with bulk soil. Low-molecular-weight (MW) DON (< 3000 Da) was undetectable in bulk soil but comprised 15% of rhizosphere DON. Extracellular enzyme production in many bacteria requires quorum sensing (QS), cell-density-dependent group behavior. Because proteobacteria are considered major rhizosphere colonizers, we assayed the proteobacterial QS signals N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), which were significantly increased in the rhizosphere. To investigate the linkage between soil signaling and nitrogen cycling, we characterized 533 bacterial isolates from Avena rhizosphere: 24% had chitinase or protease activity and AHL production; disruption of QS in seven of eight isolates disrupted enzyme activity. Many Alphaproteobacteria were newly found with QS-controlled extracellular enzyme activity. Enhanced specific activities of nitrogen-cycling enzymes accompanied by bacterial density-dependent behaviors in rhizosphere soil gives rise to the hypothesis that QS could be a control point in the complex process of rhizosphere nitrogen mineralization.

TI  - Species pool and local assembly processes drive microbial β diversity in primary forest soils
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Primary forests occupy high biodiversity, where the alpha diversity of both above- and below-ground has been well studied. Nevertheless, our current knowledge of the beta diversity in below-ground is limited. To examine the mechanisms driving patterns of beta diversity in soil microbes, we collected soil samples from three typical tropical, subtropical, and temperate primary forests in southwest China. Results indicated the highest soil bacterial and fungal beta diversity in the tropical forest, lowest bacterial beta diversity in the subtropical forest, and lowest fungal beta diversity in the temperate forest. Community assembly, regional species pools, and microbial interactions jointly shaped soil bacterial beta diversity patterns. Soil fungal beta diversity patterns were influenced by regional species pools and community assembly. Furthermore, microbial beta diversity was closely correlated to soil microbial metabolism, carbon cycling, and nitrogen cycling functional potentials. Our study emphasizes that not only soil microbial alpha diversity, but also beta diversity attribute to carbon and nitrogen biochemical cycling, which provides new insight for the connections between microbial diversity maintenance and ecosystem functions in old-growth forests.

TI  - Exploring the effects of different fertilizer application durations on the functional microbial profiles of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling by using metagenomics in Paulownia plantations in a subtropical zone
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Paulownia fortunei, one of the world's fastest growing timber tree species, is universally applied with fertilizer as a management approach to meet the nutrient requirements for efficient cultivation. The substantial effects of fertilizer on soil microorganisms in Paulownia plantations have been empirically tested; however, the successive chronosequence of soil microbial carbon and nitrogen functional genes under different fertilizer application durations remains limited. The objective of this study was to explore the characteristics of soil microorganisms involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas (GHG) production under different fertilizer application durations. Different fertilizer treatments, i.e., the short-term group (SG) versus the long-term group (LG), and durations were applied to subtropical plantations in southern China and compared with zonal evergreen broad-leaved forests. Results showed that fertilizer treatment significantly increased the relative abundance of Acidobacteriota and the expression of nirK and nosZ. The functional groups that dominated metabolism in SG and LG treatments belonged to Actinobacteria and Acidobacteriota, respectively, suggesting that the nutrient preference of microorganisms in forest soil may change from copiotrophs to oligotrophs with increasing fertilizer application duration. Correlation network analysis showed that the communities that dominated the carbon and nitrogen cycles belonged to Actinobacteria and Acidobacteriota, respectively, and were closely related to ammonium nitrogen and available iron. Actinobacteria and Acidobacteriota were likely the major taxa that affected soil GHG production under different fertilizer application durations. We concluded that long-term fertilizer use changed the preference of microbial nutrient uptake into recalcitrant nutrients, and the sensitivity of the microbial community to nutrients gradually decreased with increasing fertilizer application time. The dominant Actinobacteria affected soil carbon and nitrogen cycles largely by stimulating denitrification to increase the release of nitrous oxide, which might lead to the loss of nitrogen components and the intensification of the GHG effect with increasing fertilizer application time.

TI  - The increasing age of facility agriculture significantly enriched microplastics and affected soil bacterial communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution in facility agriculture is increasingly concerning, yet its interaction with soil properties and microbial communities remains unclear. This study analyzed soil samples from 10 agricultural facility bases in Beijing, revealing an average MP abundance of 1760 +/- 868.02 items/kg. MP levels showed a positive correlation with facility age, with fragments (47.3 %), films (26.2 %), and fibres (21.6 %) as the dominant forms, primarily composed of polypropylene (33.5 %) and polyethylene (17.3 %). Both facility age and MPs significantly increased the abundance of the phylum Acidobacteriota and the genus Hyphomicrobium. Further analysis indicated that soil pH, organic matter content, and facility age exerted stronger effects on soil microbial communities than MPs, shaping their ecological functions through shifts in microbial composition. Functional analysis of microbial communities using the Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) tool revealed that facility age significantly influenced microbial functions, negatively impacting carbon cycling while enhancing nitrogen cycling, whereas MP abundance showed relatively minor effects. These findings provide important insights into soil MP pollution and its implications for soil ecosystem health and sustainable agricultural development.

TI  - Glyphosate and urea co-exposure: Impacts on soil nitrogen cycling
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Glyphosate, the most widely utilized herbicide, frequently coexists with nitrogen fertilizers such as urea in soil environments. Nitrogen cycling is a key process for maintaining soil ecological functions and nutrient balance. However, the effects of co-exposure to glyphosate and urea on this process have remained unclear. This study investigated the impact of co-exposure to glyphosate (10 mg/kg) and urea (260.87 or 347.83 mg/kg, equivalent to 180 or 240 kg N/ha) on soil nitrogen cycling through a 98-day incubation experiment. Soil nutrients, enzyme activities, bacterial community structure, and functional genes were analyzed. NH4+-N and NO3--N contents significantly decreased by 44.70-53.43 % and 36.74-49.12 %, respectively. Co-exposure reduced bacterial diversity and altered nitrogen cycling genes, decreasing nifH while increasing amoA and nosZ, indicating reduced nitrogen input potential and increased inorganic nitrogen loss. Enzyme analysis confirmed excessive activation of nitrification and denitrification, lowering nitrogen availability. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) showed co-exposure indirectly decreased NH4+-N and NO3--N via enhanced nitrate and nitrite reductase activities. The study highlights the complex interactions between herbicides and fertilizers in soil environments and underscores the need for further research to understand the implications for wider soil health and crop production in agriculture systems.

Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences (IAP RAS) climate model (CM) of intermediate complexity is extended by a spatially explicit terrestrial carbon cycle module. Numerical experiments with the IAP RAS CM are performed forced by the reconstructions of anthropogenic and natural forcings for the 16th to the 20th centuries and by combined SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) A2-LUH (Land Use Harmonization) anthropogenic scenarios for the 21st century. Hereby, the impact of uncertainty in land-use scenarios on results of simulations with a coupled climate-carbon cycle model is tested. The simulations of the model realistically reproduced historical changes in carbon cycle characteristics. In the IAP RAS CM, climate warming reproduced in the 20th and 21st centuries enhanced terrestrial net primary production but terrestrial carbon uptake was suppressed due to an overcompensating increase in soil respiration. Around year 2100, the simulations the model forced by different land use scenarios diverged markedly, by about 70 Pg (C) in terms of biomass and soil carbon stock but they differed only by about 10 in terms of atmospheric carbon dioxide content.

TI  - Metagenomic Analysis Reveals the Effects of Different Land Use Types on Functional Soil Phosphorus Cycling: A Case Study of the Yellow River Alluvial Plain
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a crucial limiting nutrient in soil ecosystems, significantly influencing soil fertility and plant productivity. Soil microorganisms adapt to phosphorus deficiency and enhance soil phosphorus effectiveness through various mechanisms, which are notably influenced by land use practices. This study examined the impact of different land use types (long-term continuous maize farmland, abandoned evolving grassland, artificial tamarisk forests, artificial ash forests, and wetlands) on soil phosphorus-cycling functional genes within the Tanyang Forest Farm in a typical region of the Yellow River alluvial plain using macro genome sequencing technology. The gene cluster related to inorganic phosphorus solubilization and organic phosphorus mineralization exhibited the highest relative abundance across different land use types (2.24 x 10-3), followed by the gene cluster associated with phosphorus transport and uptake (1.42 x 10-3), with the lowest relative abundance observed for the P-starvation response regulation gene cluster (5.52 x 10-4). Significant differences were found in the physical and chemical properties of the soils and the relative abundance of phosphorus-cycling functional genes among various land use types. The lowest relative abundance of soil phosphorus-cycling functional genes was observed in forestland, with both forestland types showing significantly lower gene abundance compared to wetland, farmland, and grassland. Correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed a significant relationship between soil physicochemical properties and soil phosphorus-cycling functional genes, with ammonium nitrogen, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and pH being the main environmental factors influencing the abundance of these genes, explaining 70% of the variation in their relative abundance. Our study reveals land use's impact on soil phosphorus-cycling genes, offering genetic insights into microbial responses to land use changes.

TI  - Linking leaf nutrient resorption and litter decomposition to plant mycorrhizal associations in boreal peatlands
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims Mycorrhizal type has been proposed as an effective trait integrator capturing varying biogeochemical syndromes in terrestrial ecosystems. However, for boreal peatlands, it is still unclear whether mycorrhizal associations of vascular plants can indicate leaf nutrient resorption patterns and litter decomposition rates. Methods We determined leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) resorption efficiency and proficiency of 11 common vascular plants belonging to three mycorrhizal types (ectomycorrhizal, ECM; ericoid mycorrhizal, ERM; and non-mycorrhizal, NM) in boreal peatlands of Northeast China, and measured leaf litter mass loss and N remaining of these 11 species after one and 3 years of decomposition using the litterbag method. Results Leaf nutrient resorption and litter decomposition rates varied significantly among the three mycorrhizal types. Specifically, ECM plants had greater green leaf nutrient (N and P) concentrations and lower leaf nutrient resorption efficiency and proficiency than ERM and NM plants. Moreover, ECM plants had higher leaf litter mass loss and lower N remaining than ERM and NM plants after one and 3 years of decomposition, respetively. In addition, both leaf litter mass loss and N remaining significantly correlated with N and P resorption efficiency and proficiency, indicating that plant nutrient resorption and litter decomposition were coupled. Conclusions These results suggest that leaf nutrient resorption and litter decomposition are tightly linked to the mycorrhizal associations of vascular plants, and highlight that mycorrhizal type can be applied to explain and predict the dynamics of plant-mediated carbon and nutrient cycles in boreal peatlands.

TI  - Regenerating temperate forest mesocosms in elevated CO2: belowground growth and nitrogen cycling
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - The response of temperate forest ecosystems to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations is important because these ecosystems represent a significant component of the global carbon cycle. Two important but not well understood processes which elevated CO2 may substantially alter in these systems are regeneration and nitrogen cycling. If elevated CO2 leads to changes in species composition in regenerating forest communities then the structure and function of these ecosystems may be affected. In most temperate forests, nitrogen appears to be a limiting nutrient. If elevated CO2 leads to reductions in nitrogen cycling through increased sequestration of nitrogen in plant biomass or reductions in mineralization rates, long-term forest productivity may be constrained. To study these processes, we established mesocosms of regenerating forest communities in controlled environments maintained at either ambient (375 ppm) or elevated (700 ppm) CO2 concentrations. Mesocosms were constructed from intact monoliths of organic forest soil. We maintained these mesocosms for 2 years without any external inputs of nitrogen and allowed the plants naturally present as seeds and rhizomes to regenerate. We used N-15 pool dilution techniques to quantify nitrogen fluxes within the mesocosms at the end of the 2 years. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration significantly affected a number of plant and soil processes in the experimental regenerating forest mesocosms. These changes included increases in total plant biomass production, plant C/N ratios, ectomycorrhizal colonization of tree fine roots, changes in tree fine root architecture, and decreases in plant NH4+ uptake rates, gross NH4+ mineralization rates, and gross NH4+ consumption rates. In addition, there was a shift in the relative biomass contribution of the two dominant regenerating tree species; the proportion of total biomass contributed by white birch (Betula papyrifera) decreased and the proportion of total biomass contributed by yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) increased. However, elevated CO2 had no significant effect on the total amount of nitrogen in plant and soil microbial biomass. In this study we observed a suite of effects due to elevated CO2, some of which could lead to increases in potential long term growth responses to elevated CO2, other to decreases. The reduced plant NH4+ uptake rates we observed are consistent with reduced NH4+ availability due to reduced gross mineralization rates. Reduced NH4+ mineralization rates are consistent with the increases in C/N ratios we observed for leaf and fine root material. Together, these data suggest the positive increases in plant root architectural parameters and mycorrhizal colonization may not be as important as the potential negative effects of reduced nitrogen availability through decreased decomposition rates in a future atmosphere with elevated CO2.

TI  - Bacterial community dynamics and functional profiling of soils from conventional and organic cropping systems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil microbiomes play an integral role in agricultural production systems. Understanding of the complex microbial community structure and responses to conventional compared to organic cropping systems is crucial for sustainable production and ecosystems health. This study investigated soil microbial community structure responses based on a four year long field experiment. Bacterial communities characterizing conventional and organic cropping systems were evaluated using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing targeting the V4-V5 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Soil bacterial community structure showed a cropping system dependant distribution, with nitrogen cycling taxa (Bacillus, Niastella, Kribbella, and Beijerinckia) dominant in conventional cropping systems, while carbon cycling taxa (Dokdonella, Caulobacter, Mathylibium, Pedobacter, Cellulomonas and Chthoniobacter and Sorangium) were abundant in organic cropping systems. Functional prediction of the bacterial biomes showed conventional cropping systems to harbour a community adapted to carbon-limited environments, with organic cropping systems dominated by those involved in the degradation of complex organic compounds. These findings suggest the existence of niche specific communities and functional specialization between cropping systems with potential use in soil management through selective promotion of organisms beneficial to soil health.

TI  - Biochar Impacts Soil Microbial Community Composition and Nitrogen Cycling in an Acidic Soil Planted with Rape
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Biochar has been suggested to improve acidic soils and to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, little has been done on the role of biochar in ameliorating acidified soils induced by overuse of nitrogen fertilizers. In this study, we designed a pot trial with an acidic soil (pH 4.48) in a greenhouse to study the interconnections between microbial community, soil chemical property changes, and N2O emissions after biochar application. The results showed that biochar increased plant growth, soil pH, total carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, and soil cation exchange capacity. The results of high-throughput sequencing showed that biochar application increased alpha-diversity significantly and changed the relative abundances of some microbes that are related with carbon and nitrogen cycling at the family level. Biochar amendment stimulated both nitrification and denitrification processes, while reducing N2O emissions overall. Results of redundancy analysis indicated biochar could shift the soil microbial community by changing soil chemical properties, which modulate N-cycling processes and soil N2O emissions. The significantly increased nosZ transcription suggests that biochar decreased soil N2O emissions by enhancing its further reduction to N-2.

TI  - Ectomycorrhizal associations in the tropics - biogeography, diversity patterns and ecosystem roles
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations were historically considered rare or absent from tropical ecosystems. Although most tropical forests are dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) trees, ECM associations are widespread and found in all tropical regions. Here, we highlight emerging patterns of ECM biogeography, diversity and ecosystem functions, identify knowledge gaps, and offer direction for future research. At the continental and regional scales, tropical ECM systems are highly diverse and vary widely in ECM plant and fungal abundance, diversity, composition and phylogenetic affinities. We found strong regional differences among the dominant host plant families, suggesting that biogeographical factors strongly influence tropical ECM symbioses. Both ECM plants and fungi also exhibit strong turnover along altitudinal and soil fertility gradients, suggesting niche differentiation among taxa. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are often more abundant and diverse in sites with nutrient-poor soils, suggesting that ECM associations can optimize plant nutrition and may contribute to the maintenance of tropical monodominant forests. More research is needed to elucidate the diversity patterns of ECM fungi and plants in the tropics and to clarify the role of this symbiosis in nutrient and carbon cycling.

TI  - Effects of timber harvesting on the genetic potential for carbon and nitrogen cycling in five North American forest ecozones
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Forest ecosystems are critical to global biogeochemica I cycles but under pressure from harvesting and climate change. We investigated the effects of organic matter (OM) removal during forest harvesting on the genetic potential of soil communities for biomass decomposition and nitrogen cycling in five ecozones across North America. We analyzed 107 samples, representing four treatments with varied levels of OM removal, at Long-Term Soil Productivity Study sites. Samples were collected more than ten years after harvesting and replanting and were analyzed via shotgun metagenomics. High-quality short reads totaling 1.2 Tbp were compared to the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme (CAZy) database and a custom database of nitrogen cycle genes. Gene profile variation was mostly explained by ecozone and soil layer. Eleven CAZy and nine nitrogen cycle gene families were associated with particular soil layers across all ecozones. Treatment effects on gene profiles were mainly due to harvesting, and only rarely to the extent of OM removal. Harvesting generally decreased the relative abundance of CAZy genes while increasing that of nitrogen cycle genes, although these effects varied among ecozones. Our results suggest that ecozone-specific nutrient availability modulates the sensitivity of the carbon and nitrogen cycles to harvesting with possible consequences for long-term forest sustainability.

TI  - Key microbial taxa play essential roles in maintaining soil muti-nutrient cycling following an extreme drought event in ecological buffer zones along the Yangtze River
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Climatic extremes, especially extreme droughts, are occurring more frequently and profoundly impacting biogeochemical processes. However, the relative importance of microbial communities on soil nutrient cycling and community maintenance under natural extreme drought events remains elusive. During a record-breaking drought in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) in the summer of 2022, we collected ambient soils and drought-affected bare and vegetated soils in ecological buffer zones from two sites with similar soil and vegetation characteristics along the YRB, and examined the relative contribution of soil bacterial communities in supporting multi-nutrient cycling index (MNCI) involving carbon-, nitrate- and phosphorus-cycling and their associations with microbial network. Extreme drought decreased (p < 0.05) bacterial alpha-diversity but increased MNCI in vegetated soils at both sites, while both remained unchanged (p > 0.05) in bare soils, possibly as a result of vegetation releasing rhizodeposits under drought which selectively recruited bacterial communities. Bacterial community compositions were shifted (p < 0.05) only in vegetated soils, and they exerted more influence than alpha-diversity on soil MNCI. Notably, the Anaerolineae, identified as a biomarker enriched in vegetated soils, had close associations with enzyme activities and soil MNCI at both sites, suggesting their potential recruitment by vegetation to withstand drought. Furthermore, key ecological clusters (Module 1) in bacterial co-occurrence networks at both sites supported (p < 0.05) higher MNCI, despite no substantial variation in network structure due to drought. Specifically, the most important taxa within Module 1 for predicting soil MNCI revealed by random forest modeling analysis (R2 = 0.44 - 0.63, p < 0.001), such as B1-7BS, SBR1031 and Nocardioides, could be deeply involved in soil nitrogen-cycling, suggesting an essential role of specialized interactions of bacterial communities in maintaining soil multifunctionality. Overall, this study demonstrates that changes in biomarkers and functional taxa under extreme drought may better reflect the biological mechanisms involved in microbial communities impacting ecosystem function, which may aid in forecasting the ecological consequences of ongoing climate change in the ecological buffer zones along the YRB.

TI  - Changes in microbial carbon cycling functions along rice cultivation chronosequences in saline-alkali soils
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Saline-alkali soils are widely distributed worldwide and pose significant threats to food security and environmental safety. Rice cultivation is an effective strategy for ameliorating saline-alkali soils, increasing grain productivity, promoting soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation and sustaining soil health in the Songnen Plain of Northeast China. This study investigated changes in microbial carbon cycling functions along rice cultivation chronosequences at two saline-alkali sites, Daan and Qianan. Rice cultivation improved soil health of the salinealkali soils by neutralizing the pH and increasing the SOC content. Initial soil nutrient levels differed significantly at the two sites, but the nutrient dynamics were consistent, e.g., available nitrogen (AN) gradually increased, while available phosphorus (AP) initially increased and then decreased during rice cultivation. The diversity of carbon cycling genes increased with the duration of rice cultivation, while the relative abundance of genes associated with carbon decomposition decreased, which could promote carbon accumulation. These changes were primarily driven by the reduction in soil pH, followed by nutrient availability. Interestingly, at the Daan site, where AP and AN levels were relatively low, these nutrients significantly influenced carbon cycling genes. Conversely, at the Qianan site, where AP and AN levels were higher, there was less impact of nutrients than SOC on carbon cycling genes. This suggests that nutrient stoichiometry may be regulating carbon cycling genes. The soil succession process can be divided into two stages: less than 15 years of rice cultivation and more than 15 years. With longer-term rice cultivation, first the nitrogen limitation and then the phosphorus availability constrained microbial carbon cycling functions, and nutrient availability became more important than the soil pH effect. The soil nutrient and pH dynamics, together with flooding conditions in rice paddies, may limit microbial carbon decomposition, thereby promoting SOC accumulation in saline-alkali soils.

TI  - High Genetic Potential for Proteolytic Decomposition in Northern Peatland Ecosystems
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is a scarce nutrient commonly limiting primary productivity. Microbial decomposition of complex carbon (C) into small organic molecules (e.g., free amino acids) has been suggested to supplement biologically fixed N in northern peatlands. We evaluated the microbial (fungal, bacterial, and archaeal) genetic potential for organic N depolymerization in peatlands at Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF) in northern Minnesota. We used guided gene assembly to examine the abundance and diversity of protease genes and further compared them to those of N fixation (nifH) genes in shotgun metagenomic data collected across depths and in two distinct peatland environments (bogs and fens). Microbial protease genes greatly outnumbered nifH genes, with the most abundant genes (archaeal M1 and bacterial trypsin [S01]) each containing more sequences than all sequences attributed to nifH. Bacterial protease gene assemblies were diverse and abundant across depth profiles, indicating a role for bacteria in releasing free amino acids from peptides through depolymerization of older organic material and contrasting with the paradigm of fungal dominance in depolymerization in forest soils. Although protease gene assemblies for fungi were much less abundant overall than those for bacteria, fungi were prevalent in surface samples and therefore may be vital in degrading large soil polymers from fresh plant inputs during the early stage of depolymerization. In total, we demonstrate that depolymerization enzymes from a diverse suite of microorganisms, including understudied bacterial and archaeal lineages, are prevalent within northern peatlands and likely to influence C and N cycling.
   IMPORTANCE Nitrogen (N) is a common limitation on primary productivity, and its source remains unresolved in northern peatlands that are vulnerable to environmental change. Decomposition of complex organic matter into free amino acids has been proposed as an important N source, but the genetic potential of microorganisms mediating this process has not been examined. Such information can inform possible responses of northern peatlands to environmental change. We show high genetic potential for microbial production of free amino acids across a range of microbial guilds in northern peatlands. In particular, the abundance and diversity of bacterial genes encoding proteolytic activity suggest a predominant role for bacteria in regulating productivity and contrasts with a paradigm of fungal dominance of organic N decomposition. Our results expand our current understanding of coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles in northern peatlands and indicate that understudied bacterial and archaeal lineages may be central in this ecosystem's response to environmental change.

TI  - Aquatic macrophytes mitigate the short-term negative effects of silver nanoparticles on denitrification and greenhouse gas emissions in riparian soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly released into the aquatic environments because of their extensive use in consumer products and industrial applications. Some researchers have explored the toxicity of AgNPs to nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles, but little is known about the role of aquatic plants in regulating the impact of AgNPs on these biogeochemical processes and related microorganisms. Here, two 90-day pot experiments were conducted to determine the effect of AgNPs on denitrification rates and greenhouse gas emissions in riparian wetland soils, with or without emergent plants (Typha minima Funck). As a comparison, the toxicity of equal concentration of AgNO3 was also determined. The results showed that AgNPs released a great quantity of free Ag+, most of which was accumulated in soils, while little (less than 2%) was absorbed by plant shoots and roots. Both AgNPs and AgNO3 could increase the soil redox potential and affect the growth and nutrient (N and phosphorus) uptake of plants. In soils with plants, there was no significant difference in denitrification rates and emissions of N2O and CH4 between control and AgNPs or AgNO3 treatments at all tested concentrations (0.5, 1 and 10 mg kg(-1)). However, low levels of AgNPs (0.5 mg kg(-1)) significantly enhanced CO2 emission throughout the experiment. Interestingly, in the absence of plants, a high dosage (10 mg kg(-1)) of AgNPs generally inhibited soil denitrification and stimulated the emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O in the short-term. Meanwhile, the abundance of key denitrifying genes (nirS and nirK) was significantly increased by exposure to 10 mg kg(-1) AgNPs or AgNO3. Our results suggest that emergent plants can alleviate the short-term negative effects of AgNPs on N and C cycling processes in wetland soils through different pathways.

TI  - Microbial diversity patterns and extracellular enzyme activities of river sediment in different geomorphic regions of the Loess Plateau
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
AB  - Geomorphic zoning can change soil physicochemistry, and the sediment formed by soil erosion contains various types of microorganisms. In this study, samples were collected from the aeolian sand and loess regions in the Wuding river basin on the Loess Plateau to determine sediment enzyme activities and microbial communities. The environmental pollution in the aeolian sand region was worse than that in the loess region. The activities of carbon and nitrogen cycling enzyme were higher in the loess region. Electric conductivity and ammonia nitrogen in runoff were significantly correlated with carbon cycling enzyme activity. Nitrogen cycling enzyme activity was significantly correlated with temperature and total phosphorus in runoff. The bacterial communities in the aeolian sand region had higher alpha diversity index, and the values of Simpson, Shannon, and Chao1 indices were 0.98, 8.17, and 2087.95, respectively. Conversely, alpha diversity index of the fungal communities in the loess region was higher, and the values of Simpson, Shannon, and Chao1 indices were 0.92, 5.99, and 424.19, respectively. Proteobacteria and Ascomycota were the dominant phyla in the microbial community. In the aeolian sand region, silt in sediment was the most significant influencing factor for bacterial community changes, while ammonia nitrogen in runoff was the most notable for fungal community changes. In contrast, electric conductivity in runoff emerged as the most significant factor affecting the changes of both bacterial and fungal communities in the loess region. This study offered new insights into the distribution of enzyme activities and microbial communities within river sediment across various geomorphic regions, contributing to understanding of the formation of sediment microbial communities on the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Recycling peach branch waste: effects of different field return methods on soil improvement and nitrogen cycling
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsWith the rapid expansion of peach cultivation in China, a substantial amount of pruned peach branch waste is generated annually. However, research on the sustainable disposal of these branch waste remains limited. This study aims to evaluate the potential of returning discarded peach branches to the field as a novel approach for resource recycling.MethodsWe evaluated the effects of three field return methods-organic fertilizer (OF), mushroom substrate (PM) and surface covering (SC)-on soil physicochemical properties. Metagenomic analysis was employed to investigate the impact of these treatments on soil microbial communities and nitrogen cycling-related genes.ResultsAll return methods significantly increased soil nutrient content, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN). Metagenomic analysis revealed that these treatments markedly altered the composition, diversity and abundance of nitrogen cycling-related functional genes in soil microbial communities. Notably, surface covering (SC) significantly enhanced the abundance of nitrogen fixation genes (nifH, nifD and nifK) and nitrification-related genes (hao, hcp and nirS) and promoted the enrichment of nitrogen-fixing microbes such as Methylocaldum and Anaeromyxobacter. Moreover, changes in nitrogen cycling genes were strongly correlated with total carbon (TC), available potassium (AK), MBC and MBN.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that surface covering is an effective method for the field return of peach branch waste, capable of improving soil quality, enhancing nitrogen availability, optimizing microbial nitrogen cycling functions and promoting overall soil health.

TI  - Wildfires decrease the local-scale ecosystem spatial variability of Pinus canariensis forests during the first two decades post fire
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
AB  - The spatial variability (i.e. heterogeneity) of environmental variables determines a wide range of ecosystem features and plays a key role in regulating key ecosystem services. Wildfires are among the most significant natural disturbances that forests face, but our knowledge about their effect on ecosystem spatial variability is still limited. We used a 19-year fire chronosequence of natural, unmanaged Pinus canariensis C. Sm. ex DC forests to investigate how wildfires affect overall ecosystem spatial variability, as well as that of key faunal, plant and soil ecosystem attributes. The spatial variability of most soil variables and of the overall ecosystem tended to decrease after the fire and remain lower than the unburned plots even after 19 years. The spatial variability of plant-related variables, except for litter decomposition, as well as that of soil arthropods abundance, decreased more gradually than that of soil variables, reaching the lowest values in the plots burned 19 years before the survey. Our study provides evidence that wildfires are capable of significantly decreasing local-scale forest spatial heterogeneity through changes in the spatial variability of their different components, with likely yet unknown consequences for ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Bioremediation by Cupriavidus metallidurans Strain MSR33 of Mercury-Polluted Agricultural Soil in a Rotary Drum Bioreactor and Its Effects on Nitrogen Cycle Microorganisms
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Nitrogen cycle microorganisms are essential in agricultural soils and may be affected by mercury pollution. The aims of this study are to evaluate the bioremediation of mercury-polluted agricultural soil using Cupriavidus metallidurans MSR33 in a rotary drum bioreactor (RDB) and to characterize the effects of mercury pollution and bioremediation on nitrogen cycle microorganisms. An agricultural soil was contaminated with mercury (II) (20-30 ppm) and subjected to bioremediation using strain MSR33 in a custom-made RDB. The effects of mercury and bioremediation on nitrogen cycle microorganisms were studied by qPCR. Bioremediation in the RDB removed 82% mercury. MSR33 cell concentrations, thioglycolate, and mercury concentrations influence mercury removal. Mercury pollution strongly decreased nitrogen-fixing and nitrifying bacterial communities in agricultural soils. Notably, after soil bioremediation process nitrogen-fixing and nitrifying bacteria significantly increased. Diverse mercury-tolerant strains were isolated from the bioremediated soil. The isolates Glutamicibacter sp. SB1a, Brevundimonas sp. SB3b, and Ochrobactrum sp. SB4b possessed the merG gene associated with the plasmid pTP6, suggesting the horizontal transfer of this plasmid to native gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Bioremediation by strain MSR33 in an RDB is an attractive and innovative technology for the clean-up of mercury-polluted agricultural soils and the recovery of nitrogen cycle microbial communities.

TI  - Cumulative response of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen stocks to chronic CO2 exposure in a subtropical oak woodland
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) could alter the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content of ecosystems, yet the magnitude of these effects are not well known. We examined C and N budgets of a subtropical woodland after 11yr of exposure to elevated CO2. We used open-top chambers to manipulate CO2 during regrowth after fire, and measured C, N and tracer N-15 in ecosystem components throughout the experiment. Elevated CO2 increased plant C and tended to increase plant N but did not significantly increase whole-system C or N. Elevated CO2 increased soil microbial activity and labile soil C, but more slowly cycling soil C pools tended to decline. Recovery of a long-term N-15 tracer indicated that CO2 exposure increased N losses and altered N distribution, with no effect on N inputs. Increased plant C accrual was accompanied by higher soil microbial activity and increased C losses from soil, yielding no statistically detectable effect of elevated CO2 on net ecosystem C uptake. These findings challenge the treatment of terrestrial ecosystems responses to elevated CO2 in current biogeochemical models, where the effect of elevated CO2 on ecosystem C balance is described as enhanced photosynthesis and plant growth with decomposition as a first-order response.

TI  - Differentiate responses of soil nutrient levels and enzymatic activities to freeze-thawing cycles in different layers of moss-dominated biocrusts in a temperate desert
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - IntroductionThe biological soil crust, a widespread phenomenon in arid and semi-arid regions, influences many ecological functions, such as soil stability, surface hydrology, and biogeochemical cycling. Global climate change has significantly altered winter and spring freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) in mid and high-latitude deserts. However, it is unclear how these changes will affect the biological soil crust and its influence on nutrient cycling and soil enzyme activity. MethodsWe conducted this study in the Gurbantunggut Desert, a typical temperate desert, using the moss crust as an example of an evolved biological soil crust. Simulating the effects of different FTC frequencies (0, 5, and 15 times) on soil carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus-related nutrients, and extracellular enzyme activities allowed us to understand the relationship between soil environmental factors and nutrient multifunctionality during FTC changes. ResultsThe results showed that recurrent FTCs significantly increased the accumulation of carbon and phosphorus nutrients in the soil and decreased the effectiveness of nitrogen nutrients. These changes gradually stabilized after 15 FTCs, with available nutrients showing greater sensitivity than the previous full nutrient level. FTCs inhibited carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycle-related hydrolase activities and promoted carbon cycle-related oxidase activities in the crust layer. However, in the 0-3 cm layer, the carbon and phosphorus cycle-related hydrolase activities increased, while peroxidase and urease activities decreased. Overall, the nutrient contents and enzyme activities associated with the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles were lower in the 0-3 cm layer than in the crust layer. In addition, the multifunctionality of nutrients in the soil decreased after 15 FTCs in the crust layer and increased after 5 FTCs in the 0-3 cm layer. Structural equation modeling showed that FTC, soil water content, pH, available nutrients, and extracellular enzyme activity had opposite effects on nutrient multifunctionality in different soil layers. The change in nutrient multifunctionality in the crust layer was primarily caused by changes in total nutrients, while soil water content played a greater role in the 0-3 cm layer. Regardless of the soil layer, the contribution of total nutrients was much higher than the contribution of available nutrients and extracellular enzyme activity. In conclusion, it is essential to consider different soil layers when studying the effects of global climate change on the nutrient cycling of the biological soil crust.

TI  - Soil physicochemical properties and microorganisms jointly regulate the variations of soil carbon and nitrogen cycles along vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsVegetation restoration can effectively improve multiple soil functions by altering soil microorganisms and physicochemical properties. However, dynamic variations in soil physicochemical properties, microbial communities, and possible pathways to control soil C and N cycles with vegetation restoration are not fully understood.MethodsTherefore, soil physicochemical properties, enzymatic activities, microbial communities, and key C and N cycling processes were investigated in the vegetation sequence on the Chinese Loess Plateau.ResultsThe results indicated that vegetation restoration had significant positive effects on soil nutrients, C and N cycling rates, and enzymatic activities. Bacterial richness increased significantly along the chronosequence, while fungal richness decreased, but microbial diversity showed less variation. There were no clear covariant trends between soil properties, microorganisms, and nutrient cycles with vegetation restoration. Bacterial and fungal communities were sculptured by similar soil physicochemical indices, which exert more influence on bacteria than on fungi. C cycles were directly and significantly affected by soil physicochemical properties and bacterial composition/richness, but not by fungal communities. N cycles were directly and significantly affected by soil physicochemical properties and fungal composition/richness/diversity, but not by bacterial communities. Furthermore, enzymatic activities were significantly related to C and N cycles, determined mainly by soil physicochemical properties. Soil physicochemical properties, but not microorganism, were key regulators of C and N cycles.ConclusionSoil physicochemical properties can regulate C and N cycles directly or indirectly by shaping microorganisms or regulating enzymatic activities. The complicated interplay between soil properties, microorganisms, and their regulation of soil nutrient cycleS prevent a clear-cut synergy between the three factors during vegetation restoration.

TI  - The Influence of Soil Fertilization on the Distribution and Diversity of Phosphorus Cycling Genes and Microbes Community of Maize Rhizosphere Using Shotgun Metagenomics
T2  - GENES
AB  - Biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus in the agro-ecosystem is mediated by soil microbes. These microbes regulate the availability of phosphorus in the soil. Little is known about the response of functional traits of phosphorus cycling microbes in soil fertilized with compost manure (derived from domestic waste and plant materials) or inorganic nitrogen fertilizers at high and low doses. We used a metagenomics investigation study to understand the changes in the abundance and distribution of microbial phosphorus cycling genes in agricultural farmlands receiving inorganic fertilizers (120 kg N/ha, 60 kg N/ha) or compost manure (8 tons/ha, 4 tons/ha), and in comparison with the control. Soil fertilization with high level of compost (Cp8) or low level of inorganic nitrogen (N1) fertilizer have nearly similar effects on the rhizosphere of maize plants in promoting the abundance of genes involved in phosphorus cycle. Genes such as ppk involved in polyphosphate formation and pstSABC (for phosphate transportation) are highly enriched in these treatments. These genes facilitate phosphorus immobilization. At a high dose of inorganic fertilizer application or low compost manure treatment, the phosphorus cycling genes were repressed and the abundance decreased. The bacterial families Bacillaceae and Carnobacteriaceae were very abundant in the high inorganic fertilizer (N2) treated soil, while Pseudonocardiaceae, Clostridiaceae, Cytophagaceae, Micromonosporaceae, Thermomonosporaceae, Nocardiopsaceae, Sphaerobacteraceae, Thermoactinomycetaceae, Planococcaceae, Intrasporangiaceae, Opitutaceae, Acidimicrobiaceae, Frankiaceae were most abundant in Cp8. Pyrenophora, Talaromyces, and Trichophyton fungi were observed to be dominant in Cp8 and Methanosarcina, Methanobrevibacter, Methanoculleus, and Methanosphaera archaea have the highest percentage occurrence in Cp8. Moreover, N2 treatment, Cenarchaeum, Candidatus Nitrososphaera, and Nitrosopumilus were most abundant among fertilized soils. Our findings have brought to light the basis for the manipulation of rhizosphere microbial communities and their genes to improve availability of phosphorus as well as phosphorus cycle regulation in agro-ecosystems.

TI  - Aboveground net primary productivity mediates the responses of soil respiration to nutrient additions in two tropical montane rainforests
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Tropical forests play a dominant role in mediating carbon (C) dioxide exchange between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere. Plant production and microbial decomposition in tropical ecosystems are generally considered to be limited by soil nutrients, especially soil phosphorus (P), but the impact of nutrient inputs on soil respiration is little reported. We measured soil respiration rate (Rs) and its autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic components (Rh) during 2012-2017 in the nutrient addition experiments conducted in a primary and secondary tropical montane forest in Mt. Jianfengling, South China. Nutrient addition did not affect Rh, but promoted Ra and Rs in these two forests. The actual nutrient responsible for Ra and Rs increases differed between the forests, with a significantly positive P effect in the primary forest and a significantly positive nitrogen (N) effect in the secondary forest. The Ra and Rs increases induced by nutrient additions were likely attributed to the stimulation of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) rather than other factors. These results suggested that the ANPP induced increases in both Ra and Rs varied with forest successional stages and nutrient types. Our findings provide compelling evidence that N and P inputs may promote soil respiration in tropical montane forests, which has an important implication for predicting soil C efflux in tropical forests under increasing atmospheric N and P depositions.

TI  - Metagenomics reveals functional profiles of soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling under different amendments in saline-alkali soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - High salinity, low fertility and poor structure in saline-alkali soils led to nutrient cycling slow and microbial activity loss. The application of amendments has proven effective in enhancing soil nutrients, which significantly affects soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling process. However, the specific impact of different amendments on the microbial functional potential related to nutrient cycling in saline-alkali soils remains unclear. Hence, metagenomics sequencing was used to investigate soil microbial communities and nitrogen and phosphorus cycling genes in response to different amendments, and to examine the influence of soil physicochemical properties on functional genes in the Hetao irrigation district of China. The results showed that amendments application enriched the Proteobacteria abundance, while inhibiting oligotrophic groups such as Chloroflexi. Compared to the control (CK), the combined application of desulfurization gypsum and cattle manure (DC) notably increased nasA (assimilatory nitrate reduction) and nirB (dissimilatory nitrate reduction), as well as phoD and phoA genes (organic P mineralization). Furthermore, soil AK and AP were primary factors affecting microbial communities and N and P cycling genes. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling genes and their interactions in response to different amendments, where the application of amendments affects nitrogen and phosphorus cycling by altering soil nutrient availability.

TI  - Smooth brome changes gross soil nitrogen cycling processes during invasion of a rough fescue grassland
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Invasive plants have variable effects on net nitrogen cycling, but how invasion alters gross N cycling is poorly understood. We examine how Bromus inermis (smooth brome) invasion affects gross N cycling rates and investigate potential mechanisms for the changes including relationships between smooth brome and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), plant community productivity, and litter quality. Gross nitrogen cycling rates, AOA and AOB population sizes, and plant community productivity were examined in native and invaded plots in smooth brome-invaded rough fescue grassland in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Despite no changes in inorganic nitrogen between invaded and native grassland soils, gross nitrogen mineralization rates and total soil nitrogen were higher in invaded soils. Invaded areas had greater plant productivity and litter production, which likely stimulated microbial activity and higher gross mineralization rates. Nitrification rates did not differ between invaded and native soils. Smooth brome had a weak positive effect on AOA in the B horizon but not in the A horizon, and AOB responded positively in both horizons. These results demonstrate that the full effects of plant invasion on soil N cycling may be masked in net N cycling rate measures.

TI  - The Role of Deadwood in the Carbon Cycle: Implications for Models, Forest Management, and Future Climates
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS
AB  - Deadwood represents a significant carbon pool and unique biodiversity reservoir in forests and savannas but has been largely overlooked until recently. Storage and release of carbon from deadwood is controlled by interacting decomposition drivers including biotic consumers (animals and microbes) and abiotic factors (water, fire, sunlight, and freeze-thaw). Although previous research has focused mainly on forests, we synthesize deadwood studies across diverse ecosystems with woody vegetation. As changing climates and land-use practices alter the landscape, we expect accelerating but variable rates of inputs and outputs from deadwood pools. Currently, Earth system models implicitly represent only microbial consumers as drivers of wood decomposition; we show that many other factors influence deadwood pools. Forest management practices increasingly recognize deadwood as an important contributor to forest dynamics, biodiversity, and carbon budgets. Together, emerging knowledge from modeling and management suggests a growing need for additional research on deadwood contributions to carbon storage and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Livestock assemblies grazing influences the abundance of genes associated with carbon decomposition and fermentation within the soil carbon cycle
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsThe influence of assembled livestock grazing on rhizosphere soil microbial communities and the functional genes related to carbon cycling in natural grasslands remains uncertain, as grazing activities have the capacity to modify plant community compositions and soil structures, which consequently leads to shifts in the microbial community compositions and their functional distributions. MethodsThis study utilized metagenomic sequencing to conduct grazing experiments in plots with Yak grazing (YG), Tibetan sheep grazing (SG), Yak-Tibetan sheep mixed grazing (MG), and No grazing (CK). Results(1) Our findings reveal that rhizosphere soil, in contrast to bulk soil, possesses the capability to recruit beneficial microorganisms via interactions with plant roots. Under mixed grazing conditions involving yaks and Tibetan sheep, the microbial diversity within rhizosphere soil exhibits a marked increase compared to ungrazed conditions. The symbiotic network between carbon cycling genes and microorganisms is modularized, and assembled grazing of livestock primarily regulates Carbon decomposition and Fermentation genes by impacting the abundance of Acidobacteriota and Pseudomonadota. Additionally, we observed that soil microbial diversity is directly governed by soil properties, rather than being influenced by microbial biomass or the relative abundance of carbon cycling genes. ConclusionsIn conclusion, mixed grazing with yaks and Tibetan sheep proves more advantageous for sustaining soil microbial diversity, with soil properties playing a predominant role in regulating this diversity.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi reduce soil nitrous oxide emission
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play an important role in soil nitrogen cycling. However, the effect of AMF on soil N2O emission and its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we conducted a Bayesian meta-analysis to determine whether AMF has an N2O mitigation potential and what are the potential mechanisms. We found that AMF significantly decreased soil N2O emission (with an effect size of -0.90) and increased microbial biomass nitrogen and plant biomass compared to the non-AMF treatment. The effect size of soil water content and plant biomass nitrogen showed significantly positive and negative correlations with the effect size of soil N2O emission. We propose a conceptual framework with three potential mechanisms that AMF could affect soil N2O emission for further work.

TI  - ORGANIC-MATTER AND NITROGEN DYNAMICS IN CONVENTIONAL VERSUS INTEGRATED ARABLE FARMING
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Carbon and nitrogen cycling and crop yields in integrated (INT) arable farming, with 35% ofN fertilisation by organic manures, were compared with those in conventional (CONV) management, using only mineral-N fertiliser, in a long-term field trial on a calcareous silt loam soil. In fields with a relatively high initial soil organic matter (SOM) content, crops, especially potatoes, seemed to benefit from the increased soil N supply. Under INT management, original SOM levels were maintained in fields with 2.2% and 2.8% SOM in the 0-25 cm layer; under CONV management these levels decreased to 2.15% and 2.6% SOM in 6 years. In situ, periods ofN immobilisation as well as ofN mineralisation were found, while in vitro only net N mineralisation occurred. Model calculations of C and N turnover in soil were used to estimate the N mineralisation pattern and the pool sizes of microbial biomass and young humus. Mineral-N balance calculations for potatoes suggested N losses of 0-100 kg ha(-1) over the 1989 growing season. For the rotation cycle (1988-1991), calculated N losses to the environment were less than 300 kg ha(-1) and 170 kg ha(-1) at the low and the high SOM level, respectively. High losses may be partly explained by high levels of rainfall In 1988 and 1990, with denitrification as a likely cause of N loss. The highest (risk of) N loss in spring is for potatoes and sugar beet, where high nitrate levels are present in soil and N uptake starts relatively late. Calculated average efficiencies of N inputs were 88% and 72% for CONV management started on soil with 2.8% and 2.2% SOM, respectively; for INT management these values were 82% and 65%. Values ofN efficiencies and N losses are still preliminary because steady state had not yet been attained.

TI  - Responses of Soil Phosphorus Cycling-Related Microbial Genes to Thinning Intensity in Cunninghamia lanceolata Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Background: Microorganisms are important regulators of soil phosphorus cycling and phosphorus availability in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) plantations. However, the effects of thinning on soil phosphorus cycling by microbes in C. lanceolata plantations remain unclear. Methods: We performed a metagenomic sequencing analysis to investigate how thinning intensities (weak, moderate, and heavy) alter phosphorus cycling related microbial genes and their regulatory effects on soil phosphorus availability in C. lanceolata plantations. Results: Following heavy thinning, the contents of available and labile phosphorus increased by 13.8% and 36.9%, respectively, compared to moderate and weak thinning. Moreover, the relative abundance of genes associated with inorganic phosphorus solubilization increased significantly with the increase in thinning intensity, whereas genes associated with phosphorus uptake and transport significantly decreased. The metagenomic analysis results indicate that Acidobacteria (47.6%-53.5%), Proteobacteria (17.9%-19.1%), and Actinobacteria (11.7%-12.8%) are the major contributors to the functional phosphorus cycling genes in the soil. The random forest analysis results suggested that gcd, plc, phoN, ugpA, and phoR were the critical genes involved in the transformation and use of phosphorus, which in turn increased soil phosphorus availability. Structural equation modeling revealed that soil pH was the primary factor influencing changes in functional genes associated with phosphorus cycling in C. lanceolata plantations. Specifically, soil pH (ranging from 4.3 to 4.9) were positively correlated with genes involved in inorganic phosphate solubilization and organic phosphate mineralization, while negatively correlated with genes related to phosphorus uptake and transport. Conclusions: Taken together, our results demonstrate that the enhanced microbe-mediated mineralization of organic phosphorus and solubilization of inorganic phosphorus are suppressed when uptake and transportation are the mechanisms responsible for the increased soil phosphorus availability under appropriate thinning intensities. Changes in the soil microbial community and phosphorus cycling genes in response to different thinning intensities may maintain soil functionality and nutrient balance in C. lanceolata plantations. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the microbial mediation of phosphorus cycling in the soil of C. lanceolata plantations.

TI  - Response of the Abundance of Key Soil Microbial Nitrogen-Cycling Genes to Multi-Factorial Global Changes
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Multiple co-occurring environmental changes are affecting soil nitrogen cycling processes, which are mainly mediated by microbes. While it is likely that various nitrogen-cycling functional groups will respond differently to such environmental changes, very little is known about their relative responsiveness. Here we conducted four long-term experiments in a steppe ecosystem by removing plant functional groups, mowing, adding nitrogen, adding phosphorus, watering, warming, and manipulating some of their combinations. We quantified the abundance of seven nitrogen-cycling genes, including those for fixation (nifH), mineralization (chiA), nitrification (amoA of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) or archaea (AOA)), and denitrification (nirS, nirK and nosZ). First, for each gene, we compared its sensitivities to different environmental changes and found that the abundances of various genes were sensitive to distinct and different factors. Overall, the abundances of nearly all genes were sensitive to nitrogen enrichment. In addition, the abundances of the chiA and nosZ genes were sensitive to plant functional group removal, the AOB-amoA gene abundance to phosphorus enrichment when nitrogen was added simultaneously, and the nirS and nirK gene abundances responded to watering. Second, for each single-or multifactorial environmental change, we compared the sensitivities of the abundances of different genes and found that different environmental changes primarily affected different gene abundances. Overall, AOB-amoA gene abundance was most responsive, followed by the two denitrifying genes nosZ and nirS, while the other genes were less sensitive. These results provide, for the first time, systematic insights into how the abundance of each type of nitrogen-cycling gene and the equilibrium state of all these nitrogen-cycling gene abundances would shift under each single-or multi-factorial global change.

TI  - Global hotspots and trends in microbial-mediated grassland carbon cycling: a bibliometric analysis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Grasslands are among the most widespread environments on Earth, yet we still have poor knowledge of their microbial-mediated carbon cycling in the context of human activity and climate change. We conducted a systematic bibliometric analysis of 1,660 literature focusing on microbial-mediated grassland carbon cycling in the Scopus database from 1990 to 2022. We observed a steep increase in the number of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary studies since the 2000s, with focus areas on the top 10 subject categories, especially in Agricultural and Biological Sciences. Additionally, the USA, Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, and Austria exhibited high levels of productivity. We revealed that the eight papers have been pivotal in shaping future research in this field, and the main research topics concentrate on microbial respiration, interaction relationships, microbial biomass carbon, methane oxidation, and high-throughput sequencing. We further highlight that the new research hotspots in microbial-mediated grassland carbon cycling are mainly focused on the keywords "carbon use efficiency," "enzyme activity," "microbial community," and "high throughput sequencing." Our bibliometric analysis in the past three decades has provided insights into a multidisciplinary and evolving field of microbial-mediated grassland carbon cycling, not merely summarizing the literature but also critically identifying research hotspots and trends, the intellectual base, and interconnections within the existing body of collective knowledge and signposting the path for future research directions.

TI  - Microplastics stimulated soil bacterial alpha diversity and nitrogen cycle: A global hierarchical meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) pollution is recognized as a global emerging threat with serious potential impacts on ecosystems. Our meta-analysis was conducted based on 117 carefully selected publications, from which 2160 datasets were extracted. These publications described experiments in which MPs were added to soil (in laboratory or greenhouse experiments or in the field) after which the soil microbial community was analyzed and compared to a control group. From these publications, we extracted 1315 observations on soil bacterial alpha diversity and richness indices and 845 datasets on gene abundance of bacterial genes related to the soil nitrogen cycle. These data were analyzed using a multiple hierarchical mixed effects meta-analysis. The mean effect of microplastic exposure was a significant decrease of soil bacterial community diversity and richness. We explored these responses for different regulators, namely MPs addition rates, particle size and plastic type, soil texture and land use, and study type. Of the bacterial processes involved in the soil nitrogen cycle, MPs addition significantly promoted assimilation of ammonium, nitrogen fixation and urea decomposition, but significantly inhibited nitrification. These results suggest that MPs contamination may have considerable impacts on soil bacterial community structure and function as well as on the soil nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Microbial community structure and nitrogen cycling in an area affected by the tailings dam collapse under a rehabilitation process☆
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The rehabilitation of areas affected by iron ore tailings has significantly altered soil properties and microbial communities (p < 0.05). This study examines the recovery of bacterial communities and nitrogen cycling in two rehabilitated areas impacted by the B1 dam rupture: DA1, a stream channel area with significant engineering intervention, and DA2, near a forest with minimal intervention. Using microbial 16S rRNA gene sequencing we found that Pseudomonadota, Actinobacteriota, Acidobacteriota, Chloroflexota, and Gemmatimonadota represent about 71 % of the total bacteria abundance in rehabilitated areas, we also identified 7 bacterial genera (Terrabacter, Neo b11, Qipengyuania, Curtobacterium, Terriglobus, Parasegetibacter and Rhodopseudomonas) as biomarkers for DA1, 3 (Clostridium, Ensifer and Lacibacter) for DA2, and 8 (Fodinicola, Roseiarcus, Acidipila, Candidatus Udaeobacter, Planotetraspora, Mycobacterium and Clade Ia) for a reference (REF) area. Genera in DA2 and REF were associated with nutrient cycling and plant growth, while DA1 displayed a wider range of metabolisms and degradation capacities. Microbial network analysis revealed more complex networks in rehabilitated areas DA1 (nodes = 3.186; edges = 6.480) DA2 (nodes = 3.224; edges = 6.521) than the reference (nodes = 2.175; edges = 3.020). Nitrogen cycle-related genera were present in both areas, with no significant difference (p > 0.05) in the abundance of nifH, narG and amoA genes, suggesting that technosol supports efficient nitrogen cycling recovery. Overall, the study demonstrates microbial structure and function recovery in impacted areas, with technosol playing a beneficial role, even in regions with complex engineering needs. These findings highlight the potential of technosol for future environmental recovery efforts following dam collapses, motivating us to continue our research and innovation in this field.

TI  - Role of plants in determining the soil response to either a single freeze-thaw or dry-wet event
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - In a changing climate, extreme weather events are predicted to increase in frequency and magnitude. These events may induce stress in plants and soil microbial communities, but the impact of climate extremes on root soil interactions remains poorly understood. To better understand the response of a temperate agroecosystem to winter freezing and drought, a mild (-5 ?) or severe (-10 ?) freeze-thaw, or dry-wet cycle was imposed on mesocosms planted with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and unplanted soil. We measured the effect of the stresses on greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes (CO2, N2O, CH4), plant tissue composition, soil solute concentrations and soil microbial community structure. Only the most severe freezing event had a direct effect on soils, with pulses of CO2 and N2O released after thawing. In contrast, all stresses reduced C fixation and respiration in planted treatments. Total CO2 flux from planted mesocosms was reduced during the drought period and CO2 flux was negatively correlated with soil water content. The severe freeze-thaw event caused lasting damage to plants and increased rhizodeposition, resulting in increased CO2 efflux and a small alteration in soil microbial community composition. The presence of plants resulted in significantly greater total CO2 flux following freeze-thaw or dry-wet events, but only in unplanted soil was there a net increase in GHG emissions. These results demonstrate that, although the effects of stress appear magnified where plants are present, the maintenance of winter plant cover in temperate agricultural soils reduces the effects of extreme weather events on future climate.

TI  - Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) affected microbial interactions and functions by altering the rare microbial communities in soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), a persistent environmental pollutant, has been increasingly detected in soil environment. However, the mechanism underlying PFHxS-induced the nitrogen cycle and microbial defense and repair changes remains poorly understood. This study detected the effects of PFHxS (10 and 100 mu g/kg) on microbial interactions, nitrogen cycle, as well as microbial defense and repair in soil using a microcosm experiment. PFHxS significantly changed the rare bacterial and fungal communities, directly altered the protistan community. PFHxS enhanced nitrogen cycle, selectively enriched nirK-type denitrifiers, and the rare microorganisms played a crucial role in mediating the interactions among these denitrifiers. Additionally, PFHxS activated antioxidant defense mechanisms to resist oxidative damages, with the responses being more pronounced at a concentration of 100 mu g/kg. More important, PLS-PM analysis proved that the alterations in microbial interactions caused by PFHxS exposure directly and significantly affected the nitrogen cycle and antioxidant system, and their importance exceeded that of enzyme activity, gene abundance and the single microbial community. This study will prove useful for understanding the effects of PFHxS on microbial interactions and functions, highlighting the crucial role of rare microorganisms in driving microbial functions.

TI  - New insights into the spatial variability of microbial diversity and density in peatlands exposed to various electron acceptors with an emphasis on methanogenesis and CO2 fluxes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Peatlands are vital in the global carbon cycle, acting as significant sinks for carbon and releasing methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. However, the complex interactions between environmental factors and the microbial communities responsible for these greenhouse gas emissions remain insufficiently understood. To address this knowledge gap, a pilot-scale mesocosm study was conducted to assess the impact of different terminal electron acceptors (TEAs), including sulfate (SO42-), humic acid (HA), and goethite, on CH4 and CO2 emissions and microbial community structures in peatlands. Our results revealed that the addition of TEAs significantly altered the CH4 and CO2 emissions. Specifically, the addition of SO42- nearly doubled CO2 production while substantially inhibiting CH4 emissions. The combined addition of SO42- and HA, as well as HA alone, followed a similar pattern, albeit with less pronounced effects on CH4. Goethite addition resulted in the highest inhibition of CH4 among all treatments but did not significantly increase CO2 production. Community composition and network analysis indicated that TEAs primarily determined the structure of microbial communities, with each treatment exhibiting distinct taxa networks. Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla across all mesocosms. The presence of methanotrophs, including Methylomirabilales and Methylococcales, was linked to the inhibition of CH4 emissions in these mesocosms. This study provides novel insights into the spatial variability of microbial diversity and density in peatlands under various TEAs, emphasizing the role of methanogenesis and CO2 fluxes in carbon cycling. Our findings enhance the understanding of carbon cycling in microbe-rich environments exposed to TEAs and highlight the potential for future studies to investigate the long-term effects of TEAs on microbial communities, enzymes, and carbon storage.

TI  - High plant diversity alleviates the negative effects of nitrogen deposition on soil nitrogen cycling multifunctionality
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction Changes in plant diversity and increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition independently influence soil nitrogen cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the interactive effects of plant diversity and nitrogen deposition on soil nitrogen cycling multifunctionality (NCMF) in grassland ecosystems remain poorly understood.Methods We conducted a fully factorial microcosm experiment to quantify the responses and underlying mechanism of soil NCMF to nitrogen addition (0, 5, and 10 g N m-2 yr.-1) and plant diversity gradients (1, 3, and 6 species).Results Our results revealed a significant interactive effect between plant diversity and nitrogen addition on soil NCMF. Specifically, high plant diversity alleviated the negative effects of nitrogen addition on soil NCMF. The addition of nitrogen reduced the soil pH, which imposed microbial stress by limiting carbon availability. In contrast, higher plant diversity increased soil organic matter via below-ground carbon inputs, thereby reducing the soil carbon limitation of microorganims and enhancing the soil NCMF.Discussion Overall, our findings suggest that maintaining or enhancing plant diversity in grasslands could be a key strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition on soil nitrogen cycling, highlighting the crucial role of plant diversity in regulating ecosystem nutrient cycling under global change.

TI  - Mediative Mechanism of Freezing/Thawing on Greenhouse Gas Emissions in an Inland Saline-Alkaline Wetland: a Metagenomic Analysis
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Inland saline-alkaline wetlands distributed in the mid-high latitude have repeatedly experienced freezing and thawing. However, the response of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and microbially-mediated carbon and nitrogen cycle to freezing and thawing remains unclear. We monitored the GHG flux in an inland saline-alkaline wetland and found that, compared with the growth period, the average CO2 flux decreased from 171.99 to 76.61-80.71 mg/(m(2)?h), the average CH4 flux decreased from 10.72 to 1.96-3.94 mg/(m(2)?h), and the average N2O flux decreased from 56.17 to - 27.14 to - 20.70 mu g/(m(2)?h). Freezing and thawing significantly decreased the relative abundance of functional genes involved in carbon and nitrogen cycles. The aceticlastic methanogenic pathway was the main methanogenic pathway, whereas the Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera was the most abundant methane oxidizer in the wetland. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea and denitrifier belonging to proteobacteria was the major microbial N2O source, while bacteria within clade II nosZ was the major microbial N2O sink. Freezing and thawing reduced the relative abundance of these genes, leading to a decrease in GHG flux.

TI  - Frugivory underpins the nitrogen cycle
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Tropical rainforests are populated by large frugivores that feed upon fruit-producing woody species, yet their role in regulating the cycle of globally important biogeochemical elements such as nitrogen is still unknown. This is particularly relevant because tropical forests play a prominent role in the nitrogen cycle and are becoming rapidly defaunated. Furthermore, frugivory is not considered in current plant-large herbivore-nutrient cycling frameworks exclusively focused on grazers and browsers.
   Here we used a long-term replicated paired control-exclusion experiment in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, where peccaries and tapirs are the largest native frugivores, to examine the impact of large ground-dwelling frugivores on modulating soil nitrogen cycling, considering their effects across a gradient of abundance of a hyper-dominant palm.
   We found that both large frugivores and dominant palms play a substantial role in modulating ammonium availability and nitrification rates. Large frugivores increased ammonium by 95%, which also increased additively with palm abundance. Nitrification rates increased with palm abundance in the presence of large frugivores, but not on exclosure plots. Large frugivores also stimulated the regulation of the functions of soil-nitrifying microorganisms, and modulated the landscape-scale variance in nitrogen availability. Such joint effects of large frugivores and palms are consistent with the notion of 'fruiting lawns'.
   Our study indicates that frugivory plays a pivotal role in zoogeochemistry in tropical forests by regulating and structuring the nitrogen cycle, urging to accommodate frugivory in plant-large herbivore-nutrient cycling frameworks. It also indicates that defaunation, deforestation and illegal palm and timber harvesting seriously affect nitrogen cycling in tropical forests, that play a prominent role in the global cycle of this nutrient.

TI  - Regulation of organic matter Consumption, Nitrification, and iron reduction using magnetite nanoparticles in paddy Soil: Implications for anaerobic carbon sequestration
T2  - CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB  - The role of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) in regulating carbon transformation remains controversial, particularly with regard to its impact on carbon sequestration or emissions in paddy soils, which is of paramount importance for global climate change control. This study investigated the effects of MNPs on carbon cycling and geochemical element transformation under simulated rice rotation conditions. The results demonstrated that MNPs predominantly influenced the anaerobic zone, where increasing MNP content from 0.5 wt% to 1.5 wt% significantly inhibited organic matter decomposition and regulated electron transfer pathways. Organic matter depletion in the 1.5 wt% MNP group was only 17%-48% of that in the control group across different rotation stages. Furthermore, microbial community analyses demonstrated that the abundance of heterotrophic Fe- reducing and nitrogen-transforming microorganisms increased by 2-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively, resulting in a 2-fold increase in Fe2+ content and a 5-10-fold increase in NO3--N content. Detailed physicochemical analyses and calculations confirmed that MNPs regulated the Fe and nitrogen cycles, thereby suppressing carbon decomposition and enhancing carbon sequestration. This study offers new insights into paddy soil carbon sequestration, contributing to the global carbon balance and the climate change mitigation.

TI  - Conversion of long-term monoculture plantation to agroforestry is beneficial for increasing soil carbon storage in karst yellow soil areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The transition from monoculture plantations to agroforestry systems can significantly alter soil fertility and the composition of soil microbial communities, thereby influencing soil carbon cycling processes. However, the specific effects of soil microbial communities and carbon cycling functional genes on carbon storage within agroforestry systems, particularly in karst regions, remain incompletely understood. This study evaluated the influence of three prevalent Gleditsia sinensis-crop agroforestry systems in karst yellow soil areas on soil carbon storage, microbial communities, and the abundance of carbon cycling functional genes. The results indicated that long-term agroforestry systems significantly increased surface soil (0-20 cm depth) organic carbon (SOC) content and urease (SUE) activity (p < 0.01). Notably, these agroforestry systems reduced the diversity of microbial species associated with the carbon cycle and significantly altered their microbiome composition. Furthermore, the agroforestry systems significantly decreased the abundance of genes associated with methane metabolism and the starch and lignin degradation pathways. Among them, SUE, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), acid protease (SACPT) activity, SOC and pH were the primary determinants of carbon cycling microorganisms and functional gene abundance (p < 0.01). The abundance of functional genes related to methane metabolism, starch, and lignin metabolism emerged as the most influential factor governing soil carbon storage. In conclusion, the G. sinensis-crop agroforestry systems, by decreasing the abundance of genes involved in methane metabolism, starch, and lignin degradation, decelerating carbon decomposition rates, thereby enhancing carbon storage. These findings provide critical insights for managing carbon pools in agroforestry systems within karst regions and provide essential theoretical support for the development of sustainable forest management models.

TI  - Precipitation patterns and N availability alter plant-soil microbial C and N dynamics
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Shifts in the frequency and magnitude of rain events (precipitation patterns) associated with climate change may impact ecosystem nitrogen and carbon cycling through effects on plant physiology and soil microbial activity. Here, we determined how the combination of temporal irrigation distribution and N supply affects plant-microbial C and N dynamics in microcosms with winter wheat. First, we investigated legacy effect of 12 weeks of contrasting irrigation distribution (frequent and small versus infrequent and large water inputs) and N inputs (high versus low) on plant biomass, organic and inorganic N pools, and potential nitrification and denitrification rates. Second, we investigated legacy effects of these treatments on C and N fluxes in plants and microbes over 29 h after a rewetting event, using C-13-CO2 and N-15-NH4 labeling. We found that irrigation distribution and N input led to significant differences in plant responses and soil C input, setting the scene for the rewetting response. Immediately after rewetting, microorganisms outcompeted plants for soil mineral N. However, over time, the net outcome of competition improved for plants regardless of water or N input history. Further, we found that a history of frequent irrigation led to more productive plants (biomass and rate of photosynthesis) and increased their net competitiveness for N over microorganisms. This suggests that the shift toward more extreme fluctuations in soil moisture predicted by climate forecasts for most temperate zones may have negative implications for plant productivity due to altered N dynamics between plants and soil microorganisms.

TI  - Effect of elevated O3 on rhizospheric enzymatic activities of ozone sensitive and tolerant wheat cultivars
T2  - ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Tropospheric ozone (O-3) is considered harmful to agriculture production and soil community. Wheat cultivars HD 2987 (O-3 sensitive) and Kharchiya 65 (O-3 tolerant) were grown under ambient and elevated (ambient + 30 ppb) levels of O-3 (EO) using open top chambers, and microbial biomass and enzymatic activities were investigated in soil rhizosphere. Elevated O-3 declined soil enzymatic activities related to carbon cycling viz. beta-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, cellulase and amylase more in sensitive cultivar compared to tolerant. Enzymatic activities linked to nitrogen cycling like N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and urease decreased while protease and glycine aminopeptidase increased. Microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen declined more in sensitive cultivar by 11.1 and 21.2%, respectively. Root biomass reduced in wheat cultivars with an increase of their phenolics contents by 34.3 and 10.2% in HD 2987 and Kharchiya 65, respectively at 60 days after germination. Non-significant changes were observed in soil organic carbon and total nitrogen in both the cultivars. Redundancy analysis suggested that soil enzymatic activities were predominantly affected by O-3 induced changes in microbial biomass carbon and root biomass. Study also showed that rhizosphere of sensitive cultivar HD 2987 was affected more under EO as compared to tolerant Kharchiya 65.

TI  - Effects of different maize residue managements on soil organic nitrogen cycling in different soil layers in northeast China
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
AB  - A field experiment was conducted in northeast China to examine the response of nitrogen cycling enzymes, that is, protease, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), amidase, urease, and peptidase, as well soil organic nitrogen (SON) fractions and their relationships to RT (no maize residue application), NT (no tillage with maize residues placed on the surface), TT (plow maize residues into the soil at 0-35 cm depth in the first year, 0-20 cm in the second year, and 0-15 cm in the third year), and PT (plow maize residues into soil at 0-35 cm depth). The results have shown that NT significantly enhanced the activities of protease and NAG at 0-10 cm soil depth in comparison with other treatments. NT and TT significantly enhanced the activities of protease compared to RT and PT at 10-20 cm soil depth. TT significantly enhanced the activities of NAG in comparison with RT at 10-20 cm soil depth. TT and PT significantly enhanced the activities of NAG and peptidase compared to RT and NT at 20-35 cm soil depth. PT significantly increased the activities of protease in comparison with RT at 20-35 cm soil depth. NT, TT, and PT significantly enhanced the activities of peptidase compared to RT at 10-20 cm soil depth. NT significantly increased the concentration of hydrolyzable NH4+-N$$ {\mathrm{NH}}_4<^>{+}\hbox{-} \mathrm{N} $$ in comparison with other treatments at 0-10 cm soil depth. PT significantly enhanced the concentration of hydrolyzable NH4+-N$$ {\mathrm{NH}}_4<^>{+}\hbox{-} \mathrm{N} $$ and amino acid N compared to other treatments at 20-35 cm soil depth. Redundancy analysis showed that protease played a crucial role in the cycling of SON under RT and NT, whereas peptidase and NAG played a significant role in the cycling of SON under TT and PT, respectively. This study provided a comprehensive understanding of crop residue return methods for regulating soil N cycling.
   To deepen our understanding of soil nitrogen cycling under different crop residue managements in northeast China, we conducted a field experiment with different maize residue incorporation methods and examined nitrogen cycling enzymes and organic nitrogen fractions, besides, the correlations between nitrogen cycling enzymes and organic nitrogen fractions were also explored. The results indicates that soil nitrogen cycling under different crop residue managements were regulated by different nitrogen cycling enzymes.image

TI  - A Bayesian calibration of a simple carbon cycle model: The role of observations in estimating and reducing uncertainty
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
AB  - The strengths of future carbon dioxide ( CO2) sinks are highly uncertain. A sound methodology to characterize current and predictive uncertainties in carbon cycle models is crucial for the design of efficient carbon management strategies. We demonstrate such a methodology, Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC), by performing a Bayesian calibration of a simple global-scale carbon cycle model with historical carbon cycle observations to ( 1) estimate probability density functions ( PDFs) of key carbon cycle parameters, ( 2) derive statistically sound probabilistic predictions of future CO2 sinks, and ( 3) assess the utility of hypothetical observation systems to reduce prediction uncertainties. We find that the PDFs of model parameter estimates are not normally distributed, and the residuals show statistically significant temporal autocorrelation. The assumption of normally distributed PDFs likely causes biased results, and the neglect of autocorrelation in the residual of the annual CO2 time series causes overconfidence in parameter estimates and predictions. Using interannually varying global temperature observations as forcing provides important information: terrestrial parameter PDFs are shifted and are more sharply constrained when compared to PDFs estimated when forcing the carbon cycle with a simple energy-balance model. Although CO2 observations provide a strong constraint on the total carbon sink, adding independent observations of terrestrial and oceanic fluxes has the potential to reduce uncertainty in predictions of this total sink more rapidly. Assimilating hypothetical annual observations of terrestrial and oceanic CO2 fluxes with realistic uncertainties reduces predictive uncertainties about CO2 sinks in the year 2050 by as much as a factor of 2 compared to assimilating CO2 concentrations alone.

TI  - Integrated metagenomics and network analysis of soil microbial community of the forest timberline
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The forest timberline responds quickly and markedly to climate changes, rendering it a ready indicator. Climate warming has caused an upshift of the timberline worldwide. However, the impact on belowground ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles remain elusive. To understand soil microbial ecology of the timberline, we analyzed microbial communities via 16s rRNA Illumina sequencing, a microarray-based tool named GeoChip 4.0 and a random matrix theory-based association network approach. We selected 24 sampling sites at two vegetation belts forming the timberline of Shennongjia Mountain in Hubei Province of China, a region with extraordinarily rich biodiversity. We found that temperature, among all of measured environmental parameters, showed the most significant and extensive linkages with microbial biomass, microbial diversity and composition at both taxonomic and functional gene levels, and microbial association network. Therefore, temperature was the best predictor for microbial community variations in the timberline. Furthermore, abundances of nitrogen cycle and phosphorus cycle genes were concomitant with NH4+-N, NO3--N and total phosphorus, offering tangible clues to the underlying mechanisms of soil biogeochemical cycles. As the first glimpse at both taxonomic and functional compositions of soil microbial community of the timberline, our findings have major implications for predicting consequences of future timberline upshift.

TI  - Litter amendment rather than phosphorus can dramatically change inorganic nitrogen pools in a degraded grassland soil by affecting nitrogen-cycling microbes
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Phosphorus fertilisation and increasing litter input are widely employed to restore the degraded grasslands. Despite the key roles of nitrogen-cycling microbes in determining the soil nitrogen dynamics and development of grassland degradation, little is known about their responses to these restoration efforts. Here, a microcosm experiment, with soils collected from a degraded Tibetan alpine meadow, was conducted to investigate the responses of nitrogen-cycling microbes to litter and phosphorus amendments, and their links with the changes in soil properties. Copies of the corresponding nitrogen-cycling genes (nifH, amoA, narG, nirK, and nirS genes) and their mRNAs were determined using real-time PCR. The results showed that the litter amendment significantly stimulated the transcription of nifH and nirS genes, but reduced the copies of amoA gene and bacterial amoA mRNA. It also significantly increased soil dissolved organic carbon, available phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, and microbial biomass concentrations, but decreased soil inorganic and nitrate nitrogen concentrations. The phosphorus amendment exerted little effects on soil properties and nitrogen-cycling microbes, while the litter phosphorus interactions significantly offset the individual negative effects of the litter and phosphorus amendments on the denitrifier abundance. The soil nitrate and inorganic nitrogen concentrations were positively correlated with the amoA genes and bacterial amoA mRNA copies, but negatively correlated with nirS mRNA copies. These results indicate that litter addition may decrease soil nitrate and inorganic nitrogen concentrations by suppressing nitrifiers and stimulating nirS gene expression, highlighting the vital roles of nitrogen-cycling microbes in determining the soil nitrogen dynamics during the restoration of degraded grasslands.

TI  - Bacterial community driven nitrogen cycling in coastal sediments of intertidal transition zone
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Microorganisms inhabiting in coastal sediments significantly affect the nitrogen cycling in coastal waters and ecosystems. However, the bacterial community that related to the key active nitrogen transformation processes in intertidal transition zone are still not understood. Across a long flat intertidal zone at depths from 0 to 3 m in Daya Bay, China, the bacterial communities in sediments and their driven nitrogen cycling potential were evaluated with environmental factors and 16S rRNA sequencing. The results showed that the intertidal zone is a divide for environmental factors as pH, salinity and C/N ratio, instead of an average shift from freshwater to salt water. At the same time, the environmental factors influenced the abundance of bacterial community related to nitrogen cycling. Across the intertidal zone, the dominant nitrogen transformation processes were different. At the high tide and middle tide sites, the primary nitrogen cycling process was nitrification that worked with Nitrosomonadaceae, Nitrospiraceae, 0319-6A21, and wb1-A12. At the low tide sites, nitrogen fixation was the dominant function conducted by Bradyrhizobiaceae. The reduction of nitrate was carried out with the help of Xanthomonadales but relatively weak in all sampling sites especially for low tide sites. This was mostly because the richness and evenness of bacterial community were the lowest at the low tide sites. Meanwhile, the pH, Cl-, salinity, NH4+, NO3 � and C/N ratio were the important factors that shaped the composition of local bacterial community. Further, the nonmetric multidimensional scaling results indicated that there were significant statistical differences in the composition of bacterial community among samples at different layers. The dominant nitrogen cycling processes in coastal sediments at different tide levels were revealed in this study, which offered an extended concept of nitrogen transformation along the groundwater discharge path in the intertidal transition zone. The distributions and compositions of bacterial communities and predicted functions provided a new insight for coastal environment and ecosystem management.

TI  - Effects of dibutyl phthalate on microbial community and the carbon cycle in salinized soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), a typical persistent organic pollutant, is of extensive attention because of its universal detection in soils and its impact on soil ecology. However, the ecological effects of DBP on ecologically fragile salinized soils are unclear, especially as soil salinization can result in soil degradation and thus affect the soil carbon cycle. Therefore, in this study, a typical salinized soil (agricultural soil in the Yellow River Delta) was selected and treated with DBP at different doses (1.0, 10, and 50 mg kg -1) and incubated for 30 d. The results revealed that DBP exposure significantly decreased the abundance of soil microorganisms. Molecular ecological network analysis showed that some taxa related to the carbon cycle gradually became key taxa in the network, changing the composition and structure of the bacterial community. The decrease of cbbLG, cbbLR and cex, and the increase of sga, glx and mcrA functional gene abundance affected carbon conversion. Molecular docking indicated that DBP could bind to soil invertase and beta-glucosidase proteins, and change the enzyme activity. These results emphasized the critical impact of DBP on microbial communities and carbon cycling in salinized soils, and will play an essential role in DBP ecological risk assessment.

TI  - Interactions between dicyandiamide and periphytic biofilms in paddy soils and subsequent effects on nitrogen cycling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Dicyandiamide (DCD) is commonly used as nitrification inhibitors which has the potential to reduce nitrogen loss from paddy soils. In paddy systems, periphytic biofilms are commonly presented at the soil/water interface and show significant effects on nutrient cycling. However, the interaction between DCD and periphytic biofilms in paddy and subsequent effects on nitrogen cycling is unclear. In this work, microcosm experiments were carried out to study the interaction between the periphytic biofilms and DCD and the potential influence on nitrogen cycling from in paddy. Results showed that DCD affected the development of periphytic biofilms, while the presence of periphytic biofilms accelerated DCD degradation. Results also showed DCD application reduced nitrification potential mainly by inhibiting ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Higher DCD dosage increased NH3 volatilization loss. However, presence of periphytic biofilm reduced the NH3 volatilization loss but increased denitrification. Our work contributes to a better understanding on the nitrogen cycling processes in paddy, and provides useful information for the improvement of nitrogen utilization efficiency and the control of non-point source pollution.

TI  - Climate determines diversity but not abundance of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms in rivers across a latitudinal gradient
T2  - INLAND WATERS
AB  - A central goal in microecology is to understand the ecological factors shaping spatial patterns of microbial communities and the underlying mechanisms. However, the biogeographical patterns of microbial functional groups involved in nitrogen cycling (e.g., nitrifiers and denitrifiers) and their drivers at a large scale remain poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the geographical distributions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in riparian rhizosphere soils, riparian bulk soils, and channel sediments of 30 river regions along a latitudinal gradient from 21.8 degrees N to 45.1 degrees N across eastern China. We found that the diversity of nitrifiers and denitrifiers exhibited a gradual latitudinal gradient, in direct contrast to no significant changes observed for their abundance along the same latitudinal gradient. Statistical analyses suggested that climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation) were the major drivers for the diversity of nitrifiers and denitrifiers, whereas soil properties were the key environmental factors shaping the abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers. These results provide new insights into the biogeographical distributions and ecological drivers for nitrogen-cycling microorganisms in river ecosystems at a large scale and can help us to improve simulation models of the nitrogen cycle for accurately predicting the diversity of nitrogen-cycling microbes under ongoing climate changes.

TI  - Comprehensive effects of biochar-assisted nitrogen and phosphorus bioremediation on hydrocarbon removal and microecological improvement in petroleum-contaminated soil
T2  - BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Biochar is widely used in agricultural soils, but its effects with nitrogen and phosphorus amendments on petroleum-contaminated soil are unclear. This study investigated biochar-assisted biostimulation in a microcosm experiment, focusing on hydrocarbon degradation, nitrogen cycling, and soil properties. Compared to the biostimulation alone (BS), biochar combined biostimulation (BSC) significantly enhanced the abundances of petroleum hydrocarbon degraders including Lysobacter and Brevundimonas, which led to a 17% increase in total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) degradation, with 9% and 39% enhancements in saturated hydrocarbon degradation and aromatic hydrocarbon fraction degradation, respectively. Biochar also promoted ammonia and nitrous oxide oxidation by upregulating AOA, AOB, norB, and nosZ genes, while controlling nitrogen loss by downregulating nirK. Soil moisture, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), dehydrogenase activity (SDHA), and microbial proliferation were significantly enhanced. Structural equation models (SEM) indicated synergistic interactions between nitrogen cycling and hydrocarbon degradation. Biochar enhances hydrocarbon degradation and nitrogen cycling, offering a promising soil remediation approach.

TI  - No Evidence for Long-term Impacts of Oil Spill Contamination on Salt Marsh Soil Nitrogen Cycling Processes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
AB  - Salt marshes are important sites of nitrogen cycling and removal that straddle the land/ocean interface, allowing them to intercept human-derived nitrogen before it reaches coastal waters where it causes problems like hypoxia and harmful algal blooms. In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill released an estimated five million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, significantly contaminating coastal wetlands over approximately 800 km of shoreline. We investigated microbial nitrogen cycling processes in soil from four salt marshes in Terrebonne Bay, Louisiana, USA that were either exposed or not exposed to Deepwater Horizon oil over the course of 1 year (2013-2014), 2.5-3.5 years post-spill. Specifically, we measured nitrification and denitrification potentials, nitrogen cycling functional gene abundances (nirS, bacterial and archaeal amoA), and soil physical and chemical properties. We show that variation in nitrification and denitrification potentials was independent of site oil exposure. Large year-to-year differences in springtime nitrification potentials were inversely related to plant live belowground biomass, indicating that competition for nitrogen is likely an important control on nitrification. There were positive correlations between nitrification potentials and both soil extractable nitrate concentrations and denitrification potentials, supporting the idea that denitrification is coupled with nitrification. We found no evidence that there was a long-term impact of oil exposure on salt marsh soil microbial nitrogen cycling processes and the nitrogen removal ecosystem service they provide. It is important to note, however, that these impacts could have been masked by high background variability in process rates or loss of oil exposed soil to coastal erosion.

TI  - The pH influence on ectomycorrhizal nitrogen acquisition and decomposition
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - In theory, ectomycorrhizal (EM) and saprotrophic fungi compete for nitrogen (N) found in soil organic matter. However, both positive and negative effects of EM fungi on decomposition have been observed across systems, with opposing implications for soil carbon (C) storage. The conditions driving the context dependency of fungal guild interactions remain poorly understood, which has limited our ability to predict the effects of EM fungi on biogeochemical cycling at regional and global spatial scales. To address this knowledge gap, we used a publicly available dataset of soil fungal communities to examine global patterns of relative EM and saprotrophic abundance and their influence on soil carbon and nutrient cycling. We demonstrate that EM fungal dominance and its effects on C and N cycling are predictable across the globe using only soil C : N stoichiometry, host tree functional group, and soil pH as predictors. We argue that because soil pH influences the availability and enzymatic catabolism of organic N, it determines the dominant N acquisition strategy of EM fungi, which in turn governs the directional effect of EM-saprotroph interactions on rates of organic matter decomposition in forests.

TI  - Metagenomic Assessment of the Potential Microbial Nitrogen Pathways in the Rhizosphere of a Mediterranean Forest After a Wildfire
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Wildfires are frequent in the forests of the Mediterranean Basin and have greatly influenced this ecosystem. Changes to the physical and chemical properties of the soil, due to fire and post-fire conditions, result in alterations of both the bacterial communities and the nitrogen cycle. We explored the effects of a holm oak forest wildfire on the rhizospheric bacterial communities involved in the nitrogen cycle. Metagenomic data of the genes involved in the nitrogen cycle showed that both the undisturbed and burned rhizospheres had a conservative nitrogen cycle with a larger number of sequences related to the nitrogen incorporation pathways and a lower number for nitrogen output. However, the burned rhizosphere showed a statistically significant increase in the number of sequences for nitrogen incorporation (allantoin utilization and nitrogen fixation) and a significantly lower number of sequences for denitrification and dissimilatory nitrite reductase subsystems, possibly in order to compensate for nitrogen loss from the soil after burning. The genetic potential for nitrogen incorporation into the ecosystem was assessed through the diversity of the nitrogenase reductase enzyme, which is encoded by the nifH gene. We found that nifH gene diversity and richness were lower in burned than in undisturbed rhizospheric soils. The structure of the bacterial communities involved in the nitrogen cycle showed a statistically significant increase of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes phyla after the wildfire. Both approaches showed the important role of gram-positive bacteria in the ecosystem after a wildfire.

TI  - Are there links between responses of soil microbes and ecosystem functioning to elevated CO2, N deposition and warming? A global perspective
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increase in research to understand how global changes' impacts on soil biota translate into altered ecosystem functioning. However, results vary between global change effects, soil taxa, and ecosystem processes studied, and a synthesis of relationships is lacking. Therefore, here we initiate such a synthesis to assess whether the effect size of global change drivers (elevated CO2, N deposition, and warming) on soil microbial abundance is related with the effect size of these drivers on ecosystem functioning (plant biomass, soil C cycle, and soil N cycle) using meta-analysis and structural equation modeling. For N deposition and warming, the global change effect size on soil microbes was positively associated with the global change effect size on ecosystem functioning, and these relationships were consistent across taxa and ecosystem processes. However, for elevated CO2, such links were more taxon and ecosystem process specific. For example, fungal abundance responses to elevated CO2 were positively correlated with those of plant biomass but negatively with those of the N cycle. Our results go beyond previous assessments of the sensitivity of soil microbes and ecosystem processes to global change, and demonstrate the existence of general links between the responses of soil microbial abundance and ecosystem functioning. Further we identify critical areas for future research, specifically altered precipitation, soil fauna, soil community composition, and litter decomposition, that are need to better quantify the ecosystem consequences of global change impacts on soil biodiversity.

TI  - Seasonal variations in plant species effects on soil N and P dynamics
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - It is well established that plant species influence ecosystem processes, but we have little ability to predict which vegetation changes will alter ecosystems, or how the effects of a given species might vary seasonally. We established monocultures of eight plant species in a California grassland in order to determine the plant traits that account for species impacts on nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Plant species differed in their effects on net N mineralization and nitrification rates, and the patterns of species differences varied seasonally. Soil PO4- and microbial P were more strongly affected by slope position than by species.
   Although most studies focus on litter chemistry as the main determinant of plant species effects on nutrient cycling, this study showed that plant species affected biogeochemical cycling through many traits, including direct traits (litter chemistry and biomass, live-tissue chemistry and biomass) and indirect traits (plant modification of soil bioavailable C and soil microclimate). In fact, species significantly altered N and P cycling even without litter inputs. It became particularly critical to consider the effects of these multiple traits in order to account for seasonal changes in plant species effects on ecosystems. For example, species effects on potential rates of net N mineralization were most strongly influenced by soil bioavailable C in the fall and by litter chemistry in the winter and spring. Under field conditions, species effects on soil microclimate influenced rates of mineralization and nitrification, with species effects on soil temperature being critical in the fall and species effects on soil moisture being important in the dry spring.
   Overall, this study clearly demonstrated that in order to gain a mechanistic, predictive understanding of plant species effects on ecosystems, it is critical to look beyond plant litter chemistry and to incorporate the effects of multiple plant traits on ecosystems.

TI  - Soil exchange rates of COS and CO18O differ with the diversity of microbial communities and their carbonic anhydrase enzymes
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Differentiating the contributions of photosynthesis and respiration to the global carbon cycle is critical for improving predictive climate models. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) activity in leaves is responsible for the largest biosphere-atmosphere trace gas fluxes of carbonyl sulfide (COS) and the oxygen-18 isotopologue of carbon dioxide ((COO)-O-18) that both reflect gross photosynthetic rates. However, CA activity also occurs in soils and will be a source of uncertainty in the use of COS and (COO)-O-18 as carbon cycle tracers until process-based constraints are improved. In this study, we measured COS and (COO)-O-18 exchange rates and estimated the corresponding CA activity in soils from a range of biomes and land use types. Soil CA activity was not uniform for COS and CO2, and patterns of divergence were related to microbial community composition and CA gene expression patterns. In some cases, the same microbial taxa and CA classes catalyzed both COS and CO2 reactions in soil, but in other cases the specificity towards the two substrates differed markedly. CA activity for COS was related to fungal taxa and beta-D-CA expression, whereas CA activity for CO2 was related to algal and bacterial taxa and alpha-CA expression. This study integrates gas exchange measurements, enzyme activity models, and characterization of soil taxonomic and genetic diversity to build connections between CA activity and the soil microbiome. Importantly, our results identify kinetic parameters to represent soil CA activity during application of COS and (COO)-O-18 as carbon cycle tracers.

TI  - Analysis of microbial diversity of tea tree (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze.) sick rhizospheric soil using soil metaproteomic technology
T2  - ALLELOPATHY JOURNAL
AB  - Soil metaproteomics technology was used to analyse and undertand the changes in microbial diversity in rhizospheric soil of Tieguanyin tea trees (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Ktze.) of different ages. The results showed We identified 2911 protein spots in the rhizosphere soil of tea tree. These were derived from 388 species of microorganisms [331 species of bacteria (85.31 %) and 57 species of fungi (14.69 %)]. According to the analysis of microbial species in tea tree rhizospheric soil with different ages, the number of microbial species in 0, 4, 9 and 30-years old rhizospheric soils were 346, 350, 345 and 354, respectively. Among them, 310 microbial species co-existed in the rhizospheric soil with different ages tea trees. The analysis of results of microbial species and function showed that, as the tea tree age increased, the pathogenic microorganisms in its rhizospheric soil increased, while the microorganisms, for decomposing harmful substances, probiotics and microorganisms related to carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle decreased. The microbial structure and functions of tea tree rhizospheric soil changed significantly with increase in tea tree age.

TI  - Diversity of Microbial Functional Genes Should Be Considered During the Interpretation of the qPCR Melting Curves
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil microorganisms play an essential role in biogeochemical cycles. One approach to study these microbial communities is quantifying functional genes by quantitative PCR (qPCR), in which a melting curve analysis is usually assessed to confirm that a single PCR product is being quantified. However, the high diversity of functional genes in environmental samples could generate more than one peak in those curves, so the presence of two or multiple peaks does not always indicate nonspecific amplification. Here, we analyzed the taxonomic diversity of soil microorganisms harboring functional genes involved in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles, based on a database of genomes and metagenomes, and predicted the melting curve profiles of these genes. These functional genes were spread across many bacterial phyla, but mainly Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. In general, the melting curves exhibited more than one peak or peaks with shoulders, mainly related to the variation of the nucleotide composition of the genes and the expected size of the amplicons. These results indicate that the melting curves of functional genes from environmental samples should be carefully evaluated, being in silico analyses a cost-effective way to identify inherent sequence diversity and avoid interpreting multiple peaks always as unspecific amplifications.

TI  - Towards a more labor-saving way in microbial ammonium oxidation: A review on complete ammonia oxidization (comammox)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In the Anthropocene, nitrogen pollution is becoming an increasing challenge for both mankind and the Earth system. Microbial nitrogen cycling begins with aerobic nitrification, which is also the key rate-limiting step. For over a century, it has been accepted that nitrification occurs sequentially involving ammonia oxidation, which produces nitrite followed by nitrite oxidation, generating nitrate. This perception was changed by the discovery of comammox Nitrospira bacteria and their metabolic pathway. In addition, this also provided us with new knowledge concerning the complex nitrogen cycle network. In the comammox process, ammonia can be completely oxidized to nitrate in one cell via the subsequent activity of the enzyme complexes, ammonia monooxygenase, hydroxylamine dehydrogenase, and nitrite oxidodreductase. Over the past five years, research on comammox made great progress. However, there still exist a lot of questions, including how much does comammox contribute to nitrification? How large is the diversity and are there new strains to be discovered? Do comammox bacteria produce the greenhouse gas N2O, and how or to which extent may they contribute to global climate change? The above four aspects are of great significance on the farmland nitrogen management, aquatic environment restoration, and mitigation of global climate change. As large number of comammox bacteria and pathways have been detected in various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, indicating that the comammox process may exert an important role in the global nitrogen cycle.& nbsp;

TI  - Warming deferentially altered multidimensional soil legacy induced by past land use history
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The legacy effects of previous land use and climate history may affect current soil function. However, the manner in which these legacy effects of land use are modulated by the subsequent climate remains unclear. For this reason, we investigated how the legacies of soil multiple functions left by conversion of grassland to agricultural management were mediated by climate warming with a reciprocal transplant approach. The overall legacy was further separated into the contributions by changes in the abiotic properties of the soil (abiotic process) and microbial community (biotic process). We here hypothesized that warming may mediate the legacy effects of previous land use, mainly by changing biotic processes. Results indicated that warming significantly influenced the total legacies of soil respiration and three exoenzyme activities representing recalcitrant carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling, but did not affect the total legacy of beta-1,4-g lucosidase activity, which is involved in labile carbon cycling. The relative contributions of abiotic and biotic processes to the warming effects on the total legacy depended on the type of soil function. The effects of warming on land use change legacies were derived from altered bacterial community structure. The results of the present study suggest that climate conditions could interact with land use legacy to determine the ecosystem functions in a process specific way.

TI  - Ecosystem development and carbon cycle on a glacier foreland in the high Arctic, Ny-Alesund, Svalbard
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH
AB  - The Arctic terrestrial ecosystem is thought to be extremely susceptible to climate change. However, because of the diverse responses of ecosystem components to change. an overall response of the ecosystem carbon cycle to climate change is still hard to predict. In this review, we focus on several recent studies conducted to clarify the pattern of the carbon cycle on the deglaciated area of Ny-angstrom lesund. Svalbard in the high Arctic. Vegetation cover and soil carbon pools tended to increase with the progress of succession. However, even in the latter stages of succession, the size of the soil carbon pool was much smaller than those reported for the low Arctic tundra. Cryptogams contributed the major proportion of phytomass in the later stages. However, because of water limitation, their net primary production was smaller than that of the vascular plants. The compartment model that incorporated major carbon pools and flows suggested that the ecosystem of the later stages is likely to be a net sink of carbon at least for the summer season. Based on the eco-physiological characteristics of the major ecosystem components, we suggest several possible scenarios of future changes in the ecosystem carbon cycle.

TI  - Soil Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency in Natural Terrestrial Ecosystems
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Soil microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) is the ratio of carbon allocated to microbial growth to that taken up by microorganisms. Soil microbial CUE affects terrestrial ecosystem processes such as greenhouse gas emissions, carbon turnover, and sequestration, which is an important indicator of changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Firstly, we summarized the three methods of soil microbial CUE, stoichiometric modeling, 13C glucose tracing, and 18O water tracing, and compared the advantages and limitations of the three methods. Then, we analyzed the single or combined effects of different environmental factors on soil microbial CUE in grassland ecosystems, forest ecosystems, and wetland ecosystems. Finally, we suggested that future research should focus on the following aspects: the influence of management patterns on CUE (such as grazing and the prohibition of grazing in grassland ecosystems, forest gap, and thinning in forest ecosystems); effects of the strategies of microorganisms for adapting to environmental changes on CUE; effects of anaerobic metabolic pathways, especially in wetland ecosystems; and effects of microbial taxonomic level. This study contributes to the investigation of the microbial mechanisms of carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

TI  - The Microbial Nitrogen Cycling, Bacterial Community Composition, and Functional Potential in a Natural Grassland Are Stable from Breaking Dormancy to Being Dormant Again
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - The quantity of grass-root exudates varies by season, suggesting temporal shifts in soil microbial community composition and activity across a growing season. We hypothesized that bacterial community and nitrogen cycle-associated prokaryotic gene expressions shift across three phases of the growing season. To test this hypothesis, we quantified gene and transcript copy number of nitrogen fixation (nifH), ammonia oxidation (amoA, hao, nxrB), denitrification (narG, napA, nirK, nirS, norB, nosZ), dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (nrfA), and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (hzs, hdh) using the pre-optimized Nitrogen Cycle Evaluation (NiCE) chip. Bacterial community composition was characterized using V-3-V-4 of the 16S rRNA gene, and PICRUSt2 was used to draw out functional inferences. Surprisingly, the nitrogen cycle genes and transcript quantities were largely stable and unresponsive to seasonal changes. We found that genes and transcripts related to ammonia oxidation and denitrification were different for only one or two time points across the seasons (p < 0.05). However, overall, the nitrogen cycling genes did not show drastic variations. Similarly, the bacterial community also did not vary across the seasons. In contrast, the predicted functional potential was slightly low for May and remained constant for other months. Moreover, soil chemical properties showed a seasonal pattern only for nitrate and ammonium concentrations, while ammonia oxidation and denitrification transcripts were strongly correlated with each other. Hence, the results refuted our assumptions, showing stability in N cycling and bacterial community across growing seasons in a natural grassland.

TI  - Periphytic biofilms-mediated microbial interactions and their impact on the nitrogen cycle in rice paddies
T2  - ECO-ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH
AB  - Rice paddies are unique waterlogged wetlands artificially constructed for agricultural production. Periphytic biofilms (PBs) at the soil-water interface play an important role in rice paddies characterized by high nutrient input but low utilization efficiency. PBs are composed of microbial aggregates, including a wide variety of microorganisms (algae, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and metazoa), extracellular polymeric substances and minerals (iron, aluminum, and calcium), which form an integrated food web and energy flux within a relatively stable micro-ecosystem. PBs are crucial to regulate and streamline the nitrogen cycle by neutralizing nitrogen losses and improving rice production since PBs can serve as both a sink by capturing surplus nitrogen and a source by slowly re-releasing this nitrogen for reutilization. Here the ecological advantages of PBs in regulating the nitrogen cycle in rice paddies are illustrated. We summarize the key functional importance of PBs, including the intricate and delicate community structure, microbial interactions among individual phylotypes, a wide diversity of selfproduced organics, the active adaptation of PBs to constantly changing environments, and the intricate mechanisms by which PBs regulate the nitrogen cycle. We also identify the future challenges of microbial interspecific cooperation in PBs and their quantitative contributions to agricultural sustainability, optimizing nitrogen utilization and crop yields in rice paddies.

TI  - Microplastic effects on carbon cycling in terrestrial soil ecosystems: Storage, formation, mineralization, and microbial mechanisms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Soil is the largest environmental reservoir of microplastics (MPs) on the earth. Incremental accumulation of MPs in the soil can cause significant changes in soil physicochemical and microbial traits, which may in turn interfere with soil biogeochemical processes such as carbon cycling. With published research regarding MPs impacts on soil carbon cycling growing rapidly, a systematic review summarizing the current knowledge and highlighting future research needs is warranted. As carbon-rich polymers, MPs can contribute to soil organic carbon (SOC) storage via degradation and leaching. MPs can also affect the humification of dissolved organic matters (DOM), consequently influencing the stability of SOC. Exposure to MPs can cause substantial impacts on the growth performance, litter decomposition, and root secretion of terrestrial plants as well as soil microbial carbon turnover, inducing changes in the formation of SOC. The presence of MPs has contrasting effects on the emissions of both CO2 2 and CH4 4 from the soil. The diverse effects of MPs on soil carbon metabolism could be partly attributed to the varying changes in soil microbial community structure, functional gene expression, and enzyme activity under MPs exposure. Further research is still highly needed to clarify the pathways of MPs impacts on soil carbon cycling and the driving biological and physicochemical factors behind these processes.

TI  - Human Perturbation of the Global Phosphorus Cycle: Changes and Consequences
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The phosphorus (P) cycle is an important Earth system process. While natural P mobilization is slow, humans have been altering P cycle by intensifying P releases from lithosphere to ecosystems. Here, we examined magnitudes of which humans have altered the P cycles by integrating the estimates from recent literatures, and furthermore illustrated the consequences. Based on our synthesis, human alterations have tripled the global P mobilization in land-water continuum and increased P accumulation in soil with 6.9 +/- 3.3 Tg-P yr(-1). Around 30% of atmospheric P transfer is caused by human activities, which plays a significant role than previously thought. Pathways involving with human alterations include phosphate extraction, fertilizers application, wastes generation, and P losses from cropland. This study highlights the importance of sustainable P supply as a control on future food security because of regional P scarcity, food demand increase and continuously P intensive food production. Besides, accelerated P loads are responsible for enhanced eutrophication worldwide, resulting in water quality impairment and aquatic biodiversity losses. Moreover, the P enrichment can definitely stimulate the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, implying the great need for incorporating P in models predicting the response of carbon and nitrogen cycles to global changes.

TI  - LDPE microplastics affect soil microbial communities and nitrogen cycling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are a contaminant of increasing concern in the environment. However, the impacts of MPs on soil ecosystems and biogeochemical processes like nitrogen cycle have not been well elucidated. In this study, we designed an indoor microcosm experiment to investigate the effects of exposure to low density polyethylene (LDPE) MPs on soil bacterial community and nitrogen cycling function over a 90-day incubation. Next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes revealed that both 2% and 7% LDPE MPs exposure slightly affected the soil bacterial diversity. Further analysis at the genus level showed differential tolerance to LDPE MPs, the genera Pedomicrobium, Steroidobacter, Pseudonocardia, Nitrospira and Turicibacter were enriched in the soil with 2% (w/w) LDPE MPs amendment, while the genera Pedomicrobium, Mycobacterium and Hyphomicrobium were significantly enriched in the soil with 7% (w/w) LDPE MPs amendment on days 15 and 30. Co-occurrence network analysis further suggested that LDPE MPs changed bacterial network complexity and modularity and Acidobacteria formed intimate associations with each other in responding to LDPE MPs exposure. Additionally, LDPE MPs in soil increased the abundance of nifH, AOBamoA and nirK genes involved in nitrogen cycling in different incubation phases compared to the control. The abundance of AOAamoA genes decreased on day 15 and then increased. Conversely, the abundance of nirS genes increased during the first 15 days and then decreased. These results suggested that both 2% and 7% LDPE MPs impact soil bacterial network structure and alters functional groups involved in soil nitrogen cycling processing. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Niche differentiation of bacteria and fungi in carbon and nitrogen cycling of different habitats in a temperate coniferous forest: A metaproteomic approach
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Temperate coniferous forests sustain the highest levels of biomass of all terrestrial ecosystems and belong to the major carbon sinks on Earth. However, the community composition and its functional diversity depending on the habitat have yet to be unveiled. Here, we analyzed the proteomes from litter, plant roots, rhizosphere, and bulk soil in a temperate coniferous forest at two time points to improve the understanding of the interplay between bacterial and eukaryotic communities in different habitats. Our metaproteomic approach yielded a total of 139,127 proteins that allowed to differentiate the contribution of microbial taxa to protein expression as well as the general functionality based on KEGG Orthology in each habitat. The pool of expressed carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) was dominated by fungal proteins. While CAZymes in roots and litter targeted mostly the structural biopolymers of plant origin such as lignin and cellulose, the majority of CAZymes in bulk and rhizosphere soil targeted oligosaccharides, starch, and glycogen. Proteins involved in nitrogen cycling were mainly of bacterial origin. Most nitrogen cycling proteins in litter and roots participated in ammonium assimilation while those performing nitrification were the most abundant in bulk and rhizosphere soil. Together, our results indicated niche differentiation of the microbial involvement in carbon and nitrogen cycling in a temperate coniferous forest topsoil.

TI  - Homoacetogenesis: A potentially underappreciated carbon pathway in peatlands
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Due to anaerobic conditions, peatland soils store globally significant amounts of carbon and are an important source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. One component of anaerobic carbon cycling, homoacetogenesis (i.e., acetate formation from carbon dioxide and dihydrogen via the acetyl-CoA pathway), has rarely been quantified in natural environments because it is commonly viewed as being thermodynamically unfavorable. Here we show that in a laboratory incubation using a tracer method, homoacetogenesis occurred at significant rates in soils from three peatlands (bog, intermediate fen, and cedar swamp) despite thermodynamic conditions that appeared to be unfavorable for this process. Homoacetogens consumed dihydrogen at rates up to 3- to 10-times faster than methanogens, and homoacetogenesis accounted for 16-63% of total acetate production, with the balance likely coming from fermentation processes. Our results show that homoacetogenesis can play an important role in regulating acetate dynamics, methane production, and carbon cycling in peatlands. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Alterations in carbon and nitrogen cycling mediated by soil microbes due to the conversion of karst mountainous forests into urban parks
T2  - CATENA
AB  - The conversion of mountainous karst forests into urban parks necessitates a critical analysis of its impact on existing ecosystems, particularly regarding soil microbial diversity and its role in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Our study targeted three established mountain parks in Guiyang, China, to discern the effects of habitat alteration and park age on the soil microbiota's functional genes. The findings indicated pronounced differences in functional gene profiles between original remnant forests and created greenspaces. The artificial green spaces exhibited a heightened presence of genes related to aerobic methane oxidation, anaerobic carbon fixation, denitrification and nitrification, indicating that artificial green spaces may cultivate soil microbial communities with enhanced metabolic versatility. We revealed a positive correlation between soil nitrogen levels and the abundance of genes involved in various processes of the carbon and nitrogen cycles in these artificial green areas, highlighting the critical role of nitrogen in influencing the structure of microbial communities. Soil chemical properties (namely C, N, P, K content) and habitat type emerged as the most consequential for the gene composition related to the carbon and nitrogen cycles. The co-occurrence networks of functional genes constructed for these cycles suggest a tendency towards synergistic microbial interactions. To safeguard the interplay between human recreation and the conservation of native ecosystems, we recommend the integration of native flora preservation and meticulous soil condition management into the strategies for developing urban mountain parks.

TI  - Variations in wetland hydrology drive rapid changes in the microbial community, carbon metabolic activity, and greenhouse gas fluxes
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
AB  - Wetlands play a crucial role in the carbon cycle as they are the largest natural source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Changes in wetland hydrology can alter the rate of greenhouse gas release from wetlands and have the potential to alter Earth's carbon budget. However, the microbial dynamics underpinning these observations are poorly constrained. Here we combine monitoring of environmental parameters and greenhouse gas fluxes with monthly records of microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFAs) delta C-13 values to probe changes in microbial community and biogeochemistry in response to hydrological changes in a monsoon influenced subtropical wetland from central China. Our results show that water table depth is a key factor controlling the microbial community structure, with Gram-negative bacteria and actinobacteria increasing and fungi decreasing during dry and low water table periods. Meanwhile, the delta C-13 values of specific PLFAs decreased up to 12%e during dry compared to wet periods. The extent of depletion varied, but PLFAs from Gram-negative bacteria were most depleted in C-13, indicative for a rapid increase in methanotrophy (methane consumption) during these dry periods. Furthermore, the methane emission of the wetland was drastically reduced and even had negative flux values during dry periods, suggesting that the increased methanotrophy led to a reduced methane flux and a temporary shift of the wetland from a methane source to a methane sink. Our results indicate that short-term hydrological variations lead to a rapid response in microbial community and carbon metabolic activity that directly influences wetland carbon dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Nutrient enrichment increases size of Zostera marina shoots and enriches for sulfur and nitrogen cycling bacteria in root-associated microbiomes
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Seagrasses are vital coastal ecosystem engineers, which are mutualistically associated with microbial communities that contribute to the ecosystem services provided by meadows. The seagrass microbiome and sediment microbiota play vital roles in belowground biogeochemical and carbon cycling. These activities are influenced by nutrient, carbon and oxygen availability, all of which are modulated by environmental factors and plant physiology. Seagrass meadows are increasingly threatened by nutrient pollution, and it is unknown how the seagrass microbiome will respond to this stressor. We investigated the effects of fertilization on the physiology, morphology and microbiome of eelgrass (Zostera marina) cultivated over 4 weeks in mesocosms. We analyzed the community structure associated with eelgrass leaf, root and rhizosphere microbiomes, and of communities from water column and bulk sediment using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Fertilization led to a higher number of leaves compared with that of eelgrass kept under ambient conditions. Additionally, fertilization led to enrichment of sulfur and nitrogen bacteria in belowground communities. These results suggest nutrient enrichment can stimulate belowground biogeochemical cycling, potentially exacerbating sulfide toxicity in sediments and decreasing future carbon sequestration stocks.

TI  - Quantitative importance of subsoil nitrogen cycling processes in Andosols and Cambisols under temperate forests
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Nitrogen availability often limits plant growth in forest ecosystems. Plants, including trees, utilize soil inorganic nitrogen transformed via nitrogen cycling processes, including mineralization and nitrification. While most plant fine roots are distributed in surface soil layers, plants take up nitrogen even from subsurface soil layers in addition to the surface soil layers, especially under high nutrient competition. However, there is still limited knowledge about nitrogen cycles within deeper soil layers. In this study, we investigated the vertical profiles (0 - 60 cm) of the net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates at four Japanese forest sites with two different soil types (Andosols and Cambisols). The partial least square path modeling (PLS-PM) was used to determine factors affecting nitrogen cycling processes. The net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates per unit soil weight were considerably higher in the surface soil layer than in the deeper soil layers in Andosols but not in Cambisols. PLS-PM analysis showed that microbial biomass and soil organic matter quantities were the important factors influencing the net nitrogen mineralization and nitrification rates, indicating that a similar mechanism, which drives the spatial variations of nitrogen cycling processes in the surface soil layer, predominantly regulates the vertical variations of the processes. Moreover, it was estimated that the net nitrogen mineralization rate could be comparable at all soil types and depths when the rate was expressed per unit soil volume. Therefore, subsoil layers could be a quantitatively important source of plant-available nitrogen in Andosols and Cambisols.

TI  - Trace metals coupled with plasticisers in microplastics strengthen the denitrification function of the soil microbiome in the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Due to the lack of research on the co-effects of microplastics and trace metals in the environment on nitrogen cycling-related functional microorganisms, the occurrence of microplastics and one of their plasticisers, phthalate esters, as well as trace metals, were determined in soils and river sediments in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Relationship between microplastics and phthalate esters in the area was determined; the co-effects of these potentially toxic materials, and key factors and pathways affecting nitrogen functions were further explored. Significant correlations between fibre- and film-shaped microplastics and phthalate esters were detected in the soils from the plateau. Copper, lead, cadmium and di-n-octyl phthalate detected significantly affected nitrogen cycling-related functional microorganisms. The co-existence of di-n-octyl phthalate and copper in soils synergistically stimulated the expression of denitrification microorganisms nirS gene and "nitrate_reduction ". Additionally, di-n-octyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate more significantly affected the variation of nitrogen cycling -related functional genes than the number of microplastics. In a dimethyl phthalate- and cadmiumpolluted area, nitrogen cycling -related functional genes, especially nirK gene, were more sensitive and stressed. Overall, phthalate esters originated from microplastics play a key role in nitrogen cycling -related functions than microplastics themselves, moreover, the synergy between di-n-octyl phthalate and copper strengthen the expression of denitrification functions.

TI  - Impact of co-occurrence of microplastics and lindane on lindane biodegradation and soil carbon cycling in flooding environments
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) influence organic pollutant adsorption and desorption in the soil environment. However their effects on the biodegradation of these pollutants and the cycling of essential soil elements remains poorly understand. Hence, a particle size of 150 mu m polyethylene microplastics (PE MPs) containing lindane (gamma-HCH) were cultured in sealed serum bottles and incubated for 60 days to track their interaction on the influence of biodegrading of gamma-HCH biodegrading and sorption, as well as the carbon cycling under submerged anaerobic conditions. Results showed the degradation ratio of gamma-HCH was significantly faster in the PE MPs-soaked gamma-HCH treatment (79.05 %) compared to the gamma-HCH-only (37.65 %) and PE MPs-mixed gamma-HCH (34.94 %) treatments after 10 days incubation. The presence of lindane significantly stimulated greenhouse gas production under anaerobic conditions. By day 30, in the PE MPs-mixed gamma-HCH treatment, the concentrations of CH4 and CO2 reached 81.01 and 107.23 mmol/L, respectively. In the gamma-HCH-only treatment, the corresponding concentrations were 62.77 and 84.33 mmol/L. Additionally, dissolved organic matter (DOM) analysis revealed changes in composition and humification indices (HIX, BIX, FI, FrI) due to the co-existence of PE MPs and gamma-HCH. Microbial community analysis revealed that the co-occurrence of PE MPs and gamma-HCH significantly influenced soil bacterial structure and diversity. Notably, Bacteroidetes_vadinHA17, Desulfosporosinus, Nocardioides, Micrococcales, Acidimicrobiia, Propionibacteriales, Gemmatimonadales and Myxococcota were significantly enriched in the PE MPs-mixed gamma-HCH treatments on day 10, while only the WS4 and Micrococcales were significantly enriched on day 60. Overall, our study demonstrated that the addition of lindane significantly stimulated the production of CH4 and CO2 and this effect was further enhanced by the co-occurrence of lindane and PE MPs, which provides valuable insights into the behavior of MPs and pollutants co-contamination and their impact on the soil carbon cycle.

TI  - Elevation Shapes Soil Microbial Diversity and Carbon Cycling in Platycladus orientalis Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Diversified soil microbiomes are the key drivers of carbon fixation and plant residue decomposition in forest ecosystems. Revealing the elevation patterns of soil microbial carbon cycling in forests is essential for utilization of forest ecological resources. However, the soil microbial diversity and carbon cycle processes in Platycladus orientalis plantations across different elevations are still unclear. Here, we established a gradient with three elevations (118 m, 300 m, and 505 m) on the Beijing Ming Dynasty Tombs Forest Farm, which is located in Changping District, Beijing. The metagenomics method was applied to study the soil microbiome, with a special focus on the carbon cycle process at each elevation. We found the diversity and composition of the soil microbiomes significantly varied across the elevation gradients. The structure of bacteria and archaea was mainly driven by soil total potassium, pH and NH4+, but the eukaryota had no significant relationship with the environmental factors. The relative abundance of genes involved in microbial carbon fixation and decomposition of organic carbon were also significantly impacted by elevation, with the former showing increasing, u-shaped, or hump trends with increasing elevation, but the latter only showing hump trends. The rTCA cycle and 3-hydroxypropionate pathway were the dominant carbon fixation pathways in the Platycladus orientalis plantations. The elevation gradient shaped the microbial decomposition of plant-derived organic carbon by changing soil properties and, furthermore, led to soil organic carbon stock losses. These findings increase our understanding of soil microbial diversity and the carbon cycle across different elevations and provide a theoretical basis for the utilization of forest ecological resources to promote carbon sequestration.

TI  - Functional Assignment of Metagenomic Data: Insights for the Microbial Nitrogen Cycle
T2  - METAGENOMICS OF THE MICROBIAL NITROGEN CYCLE: THEORY, METHODS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Nitrogen is an essential component of basic bio-molecules. Atmospheric nitrogen is inaccessible to living organisms because of its inert nature but it can be fixed into usable forms by nitrogen-fixing microbial communities. The microbial nitrogen cycle is a complex process which occurs through the coordinated functioning of several microbial genes, many of which have been identified primarily from cultivable microbes. However, for unculturable microbes belonging to the community of a given environment, metagenomics is used as an alternative approach to the classical methods of genomics, including polymerase chain reaction based gene identification and restriction fragment length polymorphism. A few metagenomic studies of terrestrial and aquatic environments, including some under moderate and extreme conditions, have been carried out which focus on nitrogen-fixing microbial communities and their functional diversities. These studies highlighted the roles of the resident microbes and their genes in different steps of the nitrogen cycle. Other studies have shown that the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers in agricultural soil has led to alterations in the microbial populations due to increased nitrogen content in the soil. Recently, scientists have identified novel anammox bacteria which are responsible for the loss of fixed nitrogen from agricultural soil. Presence of anammox along with other non-anammox bacteria indicates a coordinated behaviour of these microbes in the nitrogen-cycling process; however, the complete mechanism of anammox process is not clearly understood. To gain a better understanding of the anammox and other processes of nitrogen-cycling, metagenomic studies should be combined with metatranscriptomic and functional metagenomic approaches which investigate the functional dynamics of a given community.

TI  - A timeline for terrestrialization: consequences for the carbon cycle in the Palaeozoic
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - The geochemical carbon cycle is strongly influenced by life on land, principally through the effects of carbon sequestration and the weathering of calcium and magnesium silicates in surface rocks and soils. Knowing the time of origin of land plants and animals and also of key organ systems (e. g. plant vasculature, roots, wood) is crucial to understand the development of the carbon cycle and its effects on other Earth systems. Here, we compare evidence from fossils with calibrated molecular phylogenetic trees (timetrees) of living plants and arthropods. We show that different perspectives conflict in terms of the relative timing of events, the organisms involved and the pattern of diversification of various groups. Focusing on the fossil record, we highlight a number of key biases that underpin some of these conflicts, the most pervasive and far-reaching being the extent and nature of major facies changes in the rock record. These effects probably mask an earlier origin of life on land than is evident from certain classes of fossil data. If correct, this would have major implications in understanding the carbon cycle during the Early Palaeozoic.

TI  - Effects of anthropogenic revegetation on the water and carbon cycles of a desert steppe ecosystem
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - The anthropogenic revegetation for combating desertification in China has been a long-term strategy that has induced shrub encroachment in desert steppe and regionally notable greening. Although the benefits of reversing desertification, preventing erosion, and providing biomass have been recognized, the effects of anthropogenic revegetation on water and carbon cycles, the critical process of terrestrial ecosystem, are still poorly understood. This study evaluates the effects of anthropogenic revegetation on water and carbon cycles in a typical desert steppe located in Yanchi County, Ningxia Province, Northwest China, by simulating two scenarios of grassland and shrub with the Biome-BGC model. Continuous CO2 and H2O flux measurements from 2016 to 2019 were used to validate the performance of Biome-BGC. Results showed that the anthropogenic revegetation significantly intensified the carbon cycle and increased carbon storages in the ecosystem and transformed the desert steppe ecosystem from a weak carbon source into a strong carbon sink. At the same time, the anthropogenic revegetation critically increased the water consumption of the ecosystem and decreased the soil water storage. The extreme consequence would be that the water resource will exceed the sustainable limit of ecosystems in the context of precipitation as the only water supply. Such undesired outcomes should be given more attention in state and local ecological restoration programs.

TI  - Repeated fire shifts carbon and nitrogen cycling by changing plant inputs and soil decomposition across ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
AB  - Fires shape the biogeochemistry and functioning of many ecosystems, and fire frequencies are changing across much of the globe. Frequent fires can change soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage by altering the quantity and chemistry of plant inputs through changes in plant biomass and composition as well as altering decomposition of soil organic matter. How decomposition rates change with shifting inputs remains uncertain because most studies focus on the effects of single fires, where transient responses may not reflect responses to decadal changes in burning frequencies. Here, we sampled seven sites exposed to different fire frequencies. In four of the sites, we intensively sampled both soils and plant communities across four ecosystems in North America and Africa spanning tropical savanna, temperate coniferous savanna, temperate broadleaf savanna, and temperate coniferous forest ecosystems. Each site contained multiple plots burned frequently for 33-61 years and nearby plots that had remained unburned over the same period replicated at the landscape scale. Across all sites, repeatedly burned plots had 25-185% lower bulk soil C and N concentrations but also 2-10-fold lower potential decomposition of organic matter compared to unburned sites. Soil C and N concentrations and extracellular enzyme activities declined with frequent fire because fire reduced both plant biomass inputs into soils and dampened the localized enrichment effect of tree canopies. Examination of soil extracellular enzyme activities revealed that fire decreased the potential turnover of organic matter in the forms of cellulose, starch, and chitin (P < 0.0001) but not polyphenol and lignin (P = 0.09), suggesting a shift in soil C and N cycling. Inclusion of delta C-13 data from three additional savanna sites (19-60 years of altered fire frequencies) showed that soil C losses were largest in sites where estimated tree inputs into soils declined the most (r(2) = 0.91, P < 0.01). In conclusion, repeated burning reduced C and N storage, consistent with previous studies, but fire also reduced potential decomposition, likely contributing to slower C and N cycling. Trees were important in shaping soil C and N responses across sites, but the magnitude of tree effects differed and depended on how tree biomass inputs into soil responded to fire.

TI  - Genetic potential of soil microbial nitrogen cycling affected by human activities and climate factors
T2  - SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - 1198 soil metagenomic samples were screened and analyzed for N cycling research.We generated a global map of the genetic potential of N cycle processes in soil.Denitrification and DNRA related genes are of high potential in agricultural centers.Genetic potential of N2O synthesis could be driven by N fertilizer application.The soil nitrogen cycle is primarily driven by microbial communities and provides reactive nitrogen for all organisms. With the increasing impact of human activities and climate change, biogeographical explicit patterns of soil microbial nitrogen-cycling genes and their associations with nitrogen fluxes are still unknown at the global scale. By conducting a global analysis of 1198 soil metagenomic samples, we verified that agricultural land displayed lower microbial richness and diversity values than did the other habitats. We generated a global map of the genetic potential of N cycle processes in soil and revealed that denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction processes are greater in agricultural centers than in non-agricultural areas and are mainly driven by the mean annual temperature and nitrogen fertilizer application. Soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are greater in agricultural land than in other habitats and are mainly driven by nitrogen fertilizer application, which is consistent with the genetic potential of N2O synthesis. Our study improves the theoretical framework for predicting global soil nitrogen cycling potential under complex variables and highlights the influence weight of human activities and climate factors. We strongly emphasize the importance of rationally applying nitrogen fertilizers to balance agricultural production, ecological health and climate change.

TI  - Effects of perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) on the sediment microbial communities, and the interaction mechanism with urease and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The influence of perfluorobutane sulphonic acid (PFBS) on sediment microbial communities and nitrogen cycling was systematically investigated in this study. After 28 d of PFBS, the diversity of sediment microorganisms was inhibited, with rare bacterial community demonstrating stronger structural decisive role than abundant taxa. Meanwhile, PFBS induced the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), causing elevated reactive oxygen species levels and triggering antioxidant defences. EPS could also act as a barrier between PFBS and urease to reduce the toxicity of PFBS to urease. In the PFBS-urease-EPS system, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy revealed intensified absorption peaks corresponding to pi ->pi* transitions in peptide backbone structures, indicating that there was an interaction between urease and EPS, a change in the structure of the urease backbone. And the increase in alpha-helix content indicated that the secondary structure of urease becomes more compact and improves urease activity, which subsequently facilitated ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) production in sediments. Partial Least Squares Path Models (PLS-PM) indicated that PFBS stress directly altered the abundance of nitrogen cycling bacteria, upregulated genes encoding enzymes, and increased the activities of key enzymes of nitrogen-cycling processes, thereby promoting nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Exploring the Influence of Ecological Niches and Hologenome Dynamics on the Growth of Encephalartos villosus in Scarp Forests
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
AB  - Information on how bacteria in plants and soil, along with extracellular enzymes, affect nutrient cycling in Encephalartos villosus growing in phosphorus deficient and acidic scarp forests is lacking. Bacteria in coralloid roots, rhizosphere, and non-rhizosphere soils were isolated to determine the potential role of soil bacterial communities and their associated enzyme activities in nutrient contributions in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils. The role of soil characteristics and associated bacteria on E. villosus nutrition and nitrogen source reliance was investigated. Encephalartos villosus leaves, coralloid roots, rhizosphere, and non-rhizosphere soils were collected at two scarp forests. Leaf nutrition, nitrogen source reliance, soil nutrition, and extracellular enzyme activities were assayed. A phylogenetic approach was used to determine the evolutionary relationship between identified bacterial nucleotide sequences. The clustering pattern of isolated bacterial strains was primarily dictated by the ecological niches from which they originated (rhizosphere soil, non-rhizosphere soil, and coralloid roots), thus indicating that host-microbe interactions may be a key driver of this pattern, in line with the hologenome theory. There were insignificant differences in the phosphorus and nitrogen cycling enzyme activities in E. villosus rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils in both localities. Significantly positive correlations were recorded between nitrogen and phosphorus cycling enzymes and phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils. Additionally, more than 70% of the leaf nitrogen was derived from the atmosphere. This study challenged the conventional expectation that environmental filters alone dictate microbial community composition in similar habitats and revealed that host-microbe interactions, as proposed by the hologenome theory, are significant drivers of microbial community structuring. The isolated bacteria and their plant growth promoting traits play a role in E. villosus nutrition and nitrogen source reliance and secrete nutrient cycling enzymes that promote nutrient availability in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils.

TI  - The influence of wet-to-dry season shifts on the microbial community stability and nitrogen cycle in the Poyang Lake sediment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In lake environments, seasonal changes can cause exposure of the lake sediment, leading to soil formation. Although previous studies have explored how environmental changes influence microbial functioning in the water-level-fluctuating zone, few studies have investigated how wholescale habitat changes affect microbial composition, community stability and ecological functions in lake environments. To address this issue, our study investigated the effects of sediment-to-soil conversion on microbial composition, community stability and subsequent ecological functioning in Poyang Lake, China. Our results revealed that, during sediment-to-soil conversion, the number of total and unique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) decreased by 40 % and 55 %, respectively. Moreover, sediment-to-soil conversion decreased the microbial community connectivity and complexity while significantly increasing its stability, as evidenced by increased absolute values of negative/ positive cohesion. In sediment and soil, the abundance of dominant bacteria, and bacterial diversity strongly affected microbial community stability, although this phenomenon was not true in water. Furthermore, the specific microbial phyla and genes involved in the nitrogen cycle changed significantly following sediment-to soil conversion, with the major nitrogen cycling processes altering from denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium to nitrification and assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia. Moreover, a compensation mechanism was observed in the functional genes related to the nitrogen cycle, such that all the processes in the nitrogen cycle were maintained following sediment-to-soil conversion. The oxidation-reduction potential strongly affected network complexity, microbial stability, and nitrogen cycling in the sediment and soil. These results aid in the understanding of responses of microorganisms to climate change and extreme drought. Our findings have considerable implications for predicting the ecological consequences of habitat conversion and for ecosystem management.

TI  - Climate warming enhances biodiversity and stability of grassland soil phosphorus-cycling microbial communities
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Climate warming poses significant challenges to global phosphorus sustainability, an essential component of Earth biogeochemistry cycling and water-food-energy nexus. Despite the crucial role of polyphosphate-accumulating organism as key functional microbial agents in phosphorus cycling, the impacts of global climate warming on polyphosphate accumulating organism communities remain largely enigmatic. This study investigates the effects of climate warming on the taxonomic, network, and functional profiles of soil bacterial polyphosphate-accumulating organisms, leveraging fluorescence-activated cell sorting and single-cell Raman spectroscopy. Climate warming enhances both taxonomic and functional biodiversity of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms via biotic interactions and environmental filtering, with observed functionality-biodiversity relationships supporting the functional redundancy theory. Furthermore, polyphosphate-accumulating organism network complexity and stability rise under warming with strengthened positive relationships, supporting stress gradient hypothesis and the belief that complexity begets stability. Finally, polyphosphate-accumulating organisms are significantly correlated to key ecosystem functioning in carbon and phosphorus cycling under warming. Our study suggests that preserving polyphosphate-accumulating organism communities is crucial for maintaining soil ecosystem functioning and sustainable phosphorus management in a warming world and opens avenues for predicting the responses of other functional microbial groups to climate change, beneficially or maliciously.

TI  - Seawater intrusion alters nitrogen cycling patterns through hydrodynamic behavior and biochemical reactions: Based on Bayesian isotope mixing model and microbial functional network
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Seawater intrusion is a global coastal environmental issue of great concern and significantly impacts the regional bio-geochemical environment and material cycles, including nitrogen cycling. To reveal the mechanism of seawater intru-sion altering nitrogen cycling patterns through hydrodynamic behavior and biochemical reactions, the Bayesian mixing model (delta 15N-NO3- and delta 18O-NO3-) and 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequencing are used to establish nitrogen cy-cling pathways and microbial functional network. The results show that the nitrate in the coastal groundwater is from manure and septic waste (M&S, over 44 %), soil organic nitrogen (SON, over 20 %), and nitrogen fertilizer (FN, over 16 %). The hydrological interaction has promoted the coupling between material cycling and microbial com-munity in the coastal groundwater systems. Among them, precipitation infiltration has caused the gradual decrease of specific microbes along the flow direction, such as Lactobacillus, Acinetobacter, Bifidobacterium, etc. And seawater intru-sion has caused the mutations of specific microbes (Planktomarina, Clade_Ia, Wenyingzhuangia, Glaciecola, etc.) and con-vergence of microbial community at the salt-freshwater interface in the aquifer. In the coastal intruded aquifer systems, the nitrogen cycling pattern can be divided into oxidation and reduction processes. The oxidation process involves the enhancement of nitrification while the weakening of denitrification and anammox with the increase of aquifer depth. The reduction process consists of the enhancement of denitrification and anammox while the erosion of nitrification and ammonification with increased seawater intrusion. In addition, seawater intrusion can mitigate ni-trate contamination by promoting denitrification and anammox in coastal areas.

TI  - More sensitive microbial responses to the interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation in subsoil than topsoil of an alpine grassland ecosystem
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Subsoil is a large organic carbon reservoir, storing more than half of the total soil organic carbon (SOC) globally. Conventionally, subsoil is assumed to not be susceptible to climate change, but recent studies document that climate change could significantly alter subsoil carbon cycling. However, little is known about subsoil microbial responses to the interactive effects of climate warming and altered precipitation. Here, we investigated carbon cycling and associated microbial responses in both subsoil (30-40 cm) and topsoil (0-10 cm) in a Tibetan alpine grassland over 4 years of warming and altered precipitation. Compared to the unchanged topsoil carbon (beta = .55, p = .587), subsoil carbon exhibited a stronger response to the interactive effect of warming and altered precipitation (beta = 2.04, p = .021), that is, warming decreased subsoil carbon content by 28.20% under decreased precipitation while warming increased subsoil carbon content by 18.02% under increased precipitation.Furthermore, 512 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered, including representatives of phyla with poor genomic representation. Compared to only one changed topsoil MAG, 16 subsoil MAGs were significantly affected by altered precipitation, and 5 subsoil MAGs were significantly affected by the interactive effect of warming and precipitation. More than twice as many populations whose MAG abundances correlated significantly with the variations of carbon content, components and fluxes were observed in the subsoil than topsoil, suggesting their potential contribution in mediating subsoil carbon cycling. Collectively, our findings highlight the more sensitive responses of specific microbial lineages to the interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation in the subsoil than topsoil, and provide key information for predicting subsoil carbon cycling under future climate change scenarios.

TI  - Multiple microbial guilds mediate soil methane cycling along a wetland salinity gradient
T2  - MSYSTEMS
AB  - Estuarine wetlands harbor considerable carbon stocks, but rising sea levels could affect their ability to sequester soil carbon as well as their potential to emit methane (CH4). While sulfate loading from seawater intrusion may reduce CH4 production due to the higher energy yield of microbial sulfate reduction, existing studies suggest other factors are likely at play. Our study of 11 wetland complexes spanning a natural salinity and productivity gradient across the San Francisco Bay and Delta found that while CH4 fluxes generally declined with salinity, they were highest in oligohaline wetlands (ca. 3-ppt salinity). Methanogens and methanogenesis genes were weakly correlated with CH4 fluxes but alone did not explain the highest rates observed. Taxonomic and functional gene data suggested that other microbial guilds that influence carbon and nitrogen cycling need to be accounted for to better predict CH4 fluxes at landscape scales. Higher methane production occurring near the freshwater boundary with slight salinization (and sulfate incursion) might result from increased sulfate-reducing fermenter and syntrophic populations, which can produce substrates used by methanogens. Moreover, higher salinities can solubilize ionically bound ammonium abundant in the lower salinity wetland soils examined here, which could inhibit methanotrophs and potentially contribute to greater CH4 fluxes observed in oligohaline sediments.IMPORTANCELow-level salinity intrusion could increase CH4 flux in tidal freshwater wetlands, while higher levels of salinization might instead decrease CH4 fluxes. High CH4 emissions in oligohaline sites are concerning because seawater intrusion will cause tidal freshwater wetlands to become oligohaline. Methanogenesis genes alone did not account for landscape patterns of CH4 fluxes, suggesting mechanisms altering methanogenesis, methanotrophy, nitrogen cycling, and ammonium release, and increasing decomposition and syntrophic bacterial populations could contribute to increases in net CH4 flux at oligohaline salinities. Improved understanding of these influences on net CH4 emissions could improve restoration efforts and accounting of carbon sequestration in estuarine wetlands. More pristine reference sites may have older and more abundant organic matter with higher carbon:nitrogen compared to wetlands impacted by agricultural activity and may present different interactions between salinity and CH4. This distinction might be critical for modeling efforts to scale up biogeochemical process interactions in estuarine wetlands.

TI  - Soil metatranscriptome demonstrates a shift in C, N, and S metabolisms of a grassland ecosystem in response to elevated atmospheric CO2
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil organisms play an important role in the equilibrium and cycling of nutrients. Because elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) affects plant metabolism, including rhizodeposition, it directly impacts the soil microbiome and microbial processes. Therefore, eCO(2) directly influences the cycling of different elements in terrestrial ecosystems. Hence, possible changes in the cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) were analyzed, alongside the assessment of changes in the composition and structure of the soil microbiome through a functional metatranscriptomics approach (cDNA from mRNA) from soil samples taken at the Giessen free-air CO2 enrichment (Gi-FACE) experiment. Results showed changes in the expression of C cycle genes under eCO(2) with an increase in the transcript abundance for carbohydrate and amino acid uptake, and degradation, alongside an increase in the transcript abundance for cellulose, chitin, and lignin degradation and prokaryotic carbon fixation. In addition, N cycle changes included a decrease in the transcript abundance of N2O reductase, involved in the last step of the denitrification process, which explains the increase of N2O emissions in the Gi-FACE. Also, a shift in nitrate (NO3-) metabolism occurred, with an increase in transcript abundance for the dissimilatory NO3- reduction to ammonium (NH4+) (DNRA) pathway. S metabolism showed increased transcripts for sulfate (SO42-) assimilation under eCO(2) conditions. Furthermore, soil bacteriome, mycobiome, and virome significantly differed between ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. The results exhibited the effects of eCO(2) on the transcript abundance of C, N, and S cycles, and the soil microbiome. This finding showed a direct connection between eCO(2) and the increased greenhouse gas emission, as well as the importance of soil nutrient availability to maintain the balance of soil ecosystems.

TI  - Polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics promote soil nitrification and alter the composition of key nitrogen functional bacterial groups
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) contamination in soils seriously threatens agroecosystems globally. However, very few studies have been done on the effects of MPs on the soil nitrogen cycle and related functional microorganisms. To assess MP's impact on the soil nitrogen cycle and related functional bacteria, we carried out a one-month soil incubation experiment using typical acidic soil. The soil was amended with alfalfa meal and was spiked with 1% and 5% (mass percentage) of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs. Our results showed that both LDPE and PVC addition significantly increased soil nitrification rate and nitrate reductase activity, which could further promote soil denitrification. The relative abundance of diazotrophs, ammonium oxidizing, and denitrifying bacterial groups were significantly altered with MPs addition. Moreover, the MPs treatments greatly enhanced denitrifying bacteria richness. Redundancy analysis showed that nitrate reductase activity was the most significant factor affecting the soil functional bacterial community. Correlation analysis shows that Nitrosospira genus might be for the improvement of soil nitrification rate. Our results implied that MPs exposure could significantly affect the soil nitrogen cycling in farmland ecosystems by influencing essential nitrogen functional microorganisms and related enzymatic activities.

TI  - Soil nutrients cause threefold increase in pathogen and herbivore impacts on grassland plant biomass
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. A combination of theory and experiments predicts that increasing soil nutrients will modify herbivore and microbial impacts on ecosystem carbon cycling.2. However, few studies of herbivores and soil nutrients have measured both ecosystem carbon fluxes and carbon pools. Even more rare are studies manipulating microbes and nutrients that look at ecosystem carbon cycling responses.3. We added nutrients to a long-term, experiment manipulating foliar fungi, soil fungi, mammalian herbivores and arthropods in a low fertility grassland. We measured gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and plant biomass throughout the growing season to determine how nutrients modify consumer impacts on ecosystem carbon cycling.4. Nutrient addition increased above-ground biomass and GPP, but not ER, resulting in an increase in ecosystem carbon uptake rate. Reducing foliar fungi and arthropods increased plant biomass. Nutrients amplified consumer effects on plant biomass, such that arthropods and foliar fungi had a threefold larger impact on above-ground biomass in fertilized plots.5. Synthesis. Our work demonstrates that throughout the growing season soil resources modify carbon uptake rates as well as animal and fungal impacts on plant biomass production. Taken together, ongoing nutrient pollution may increase ecosystem carbon uptake and drive fungi and herbivores to have larger impacts on plant biomass production.

TI  - Metagenomics reveals taxon-specific responses of soil nitrogen cycling under different fertilization regimes in heavy metal contaminated soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Soil deficiency, cyclic erosion, and heavy metal pollution have led to fertility loss and ecological function decline in mining areas. Fertilization is an important way to rapidly replenish soil nutrients, which have a major in-fluence on the soil nitrogen cycling process, but different fertilization regimes have different impacts on soil properties and microbial functional potentials. Here, metagenomic sequencing was used to investigate the different responses of key functional genes of microbial nitrogen cycling to fertilization regimes and explore the potential effects of soil physicochemical properties on the key functional genes. The results indicated that AC-HH (ammonium chloride-high frequency and concentration) treatment significantly increased the gene abundance of norC (13.40-fold), nirK (5.46-fold), and napA (5.37-fold). U-HH (urea-high frequency and concentration) treat-ment significantly increased the gene abundance of hao (6.24-fold), pmoA-amoA (4.32-fold) norC (7.00-fold), nosZ (3.69-fold), and nirK (6.88-fold). Functional genes were distributed differently among the 10 dominant phyla. The nifH and nifK genes were distributed only in Proteobacteria. The hao gene was distributed in Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae and Proteobacteria. Fertilization regimes caused changes in functional redundancy in soil, and nirK and nirB, which are involved in denitrification, were present in different genera. Fertilization regimes with high frequency and high concentration were more likely to increase the gene abundance at the genus level. In summary, this study provides insights into the taxon-specific response of soil nitrogen cycling under different fertilization regimes, where changes in fertilization regimes affect microbial nitrogen cycling by altering soil physicochemical properties in a complex dynamic environment.

TI  - Bidirectional Regulatory Effects of Warming and Winter Snow Changes on Litter Decomposition in Desert Ecosystems
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Temperature and precipitation are the primary factors restricting litter decomposition in desert ecosystems. The desert ecosystems in Central Asia are ecologically fragile regions, and the climate shows a trend of "warm and wet" due to the regional climate change. However, the influencing mechanisms of warming and winter snow changes on litter decomposition are still poorly understood in desert ecosystems. Furthermore, the litter decomposition rate cannot be directly compared due to the large variations in litter quality across different ecosystems. Here, we simulated warming and altered winter snow changes in the field, continuously monitored litter decomposition rates of standard litter bags (i.e., red tea and green tea) and a dominant plant species (i.e., Erodium oxyrrhynchum) during a snow-cover and non-snow-cover period over five months. We found that warming and increased snow cover increased the litter decomposition rate of red tea, green tea, and Erodium oxyrhinchum, and had significant synergistic effects on litter decomposition. The effects of warming and winter snow changes on litter decomposition were more pronounced in April, when the hydrothermal conditions were the best. The decomposition rates of all three litter types belowground were higher than those on the soil surface, highlighting the important roles of soil microbes in accelerating litter decomposition. Furthermore, we found that warming and winter snow changes altered litter decomposition by influencing soil enzyme activities related to soil carbon cycling during the snow-cover period, while influencing soil enzyme activities related to soil phosphorus cycling during the non-snow-cover period. And, notably, decreased snow cover promoted soil enzyme activities during the snow-cover period. More interestingly, our results indicated that the decomposition rate (k) was the lowest, but the stability factor (S) was the highest in the Gurbant & uuml;ngg & uuml;t Desert based on the cross-ecosystem comparison using the "Tea Bag Index" method. Overall, our results highlighted the critical roles of warming and winter snow changes on litter decomposition. In future research, the consideration of relationships between litter decomposition and soil carbon sequestration will advance our understanding of soil carbon cycling under climate change in desert ecosystems.

TI  - The functional potential of high Arctic permafrost revealed by metagenomic sequencing, qPCR and microarray analyses
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - The fate of the carbon stocked in permafrost following global warming and permafrost thaw is of major concern in view of the potential for increased CH4 and CO2 emissions from these soils. Complex carbon compound degradation and greenhouse gas emissions are due to soil microbial communities, but no comprehensive study has yet addressed their composition and functional potential in permafrost. Here, a 2-m deep permafrost sample and its overlying active layer soil were subjected to metagenomic sequencing, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and microarray analyses. The active layer soil and the 2-m permafrost microbial community structures were very similar, with Actinobacteria being the dominant phylum. The two samples also possessed a highly similar spectrum of functional genes, especially when compared with other already published metagenomes. Key genes related to methane generation, methane oxidation and organic matter degradation were highly diverse for both samples in the metagenomic libraries and some (for example, pmoA) showed relatively high abundance in qPCR assays. Genes related to nitrogen fixation and ammonia oxidation, which could have important roles following climatic change in these nitrogen-limited environments, showed low diversity but high abundance. The 2-m permafrost showed lower abundance and diversity for all the assessed genes and taxa. Experimental biases were also evaluated using qPCR and showed that the whole-community genome amplification technique used caused representational biases in the metagenomic libraries by increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes and decreasing the abundance of Actinobacteria. This study describes for the first time the detailed functional potential of permafrost-affected soils.

TI  - Effects of plant species diversity and composition on nitrogen cycling and the trace gas balance of soils
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Experiments addressing the role of plant species diversity for ecosystem functioning have recently proliferated. Most studies have focused on plant biomass responses. However, microbial processes involved in the production of N2O and the oxidation of atmospheric CH4 could potentially be affected via effects on N cycling, on soil diffusive properties (due to changes in water relations and root architecture) and by more direct interactions of plants with soil microbes. We studied ecosystem-level CH4 and N2O fluxes in experimental communities assembled from two pasture soils and from combinations of 1, 3, 6, 8 or 9 species typical for these pastures. The soils contrasted with respect to texture and fertility. N2O emissions decreased with diversity and increased in the presence of legumes. Soils were sinks for CH4 at all times; legume monocultures were a smaller sink for atmospheric CH4 than non-legume monocultures, but no effect of species richness per se was detected. However, both the exchange of CH4 and N2O strongly depended on plant community composition, and on the interaction of composition with soil type, indicating that the functional role of species and their interactions differed between soils. N2O fluxes were mainly driven by effects on soil nitrate and on nitrification while soil moisture had less of an effect. Soil microbial C and N and N mineralisation rates were not altered. The driver of the interactive soil typexplant community composition-effects was less clear. Because soil methanotrophs may take longer to respond to alterations of N cycling than the 1/2 year treatment in this study, we also tested species richness-effects in two separate 5-year field studies, but results were ambiguous, indicating complex interactions with soil disturbance. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that plant community composition can affect the soil trace gas balance, whereas plant species richness per se was less important; it also indicates a potential link between the botanical composition of plant communities and global warming.

TI  - Physical and Chemical Properties of Soils Derived from Different Parent Rocks Mediate Microbial Carbon Cycling
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Parent rock is a key factor contributing to differences in soil physical and chemical properties. However, the mechanism of microbial carbon cycle mediated by soils with different physical and chemical properties based on parent rock are unclear. In this study, the physical and chemical properties of weathering soils of different parent rocks and the characteristics of soil carbon content were analysed. The composition of soil bacteria and fungi and the genes associated with carbon cycle were analysed via genome sequencing. The results showed that the highest abundance and diversity of soil microbes was detected in purple sandstone, followed by limestone and the least in basalt. Further, the predominant bacterial phyla in the three parent rocks were Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. The predominant fungi were those belonging to phyla Basidiomycota, Ascomycota, and Mortierellomycota. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and available nitrogen (AN), available potassium(AK) and available phosphorus (AP) were the main factors affecting the composition of soil bacteria, while soil soil water content (SWC) pH and AP were the main factors affecting the composition of soil fungi. Similarly, the relative abundance of functional genes associated with soil carbon cycle was the greatest in the purple sandstone, followed by limestone and the least in basalt. The variation in relative abundance of the genes was correlated with the soil physico-chemical properties, especially soil SWC, pH, and AP, which limited carbon metabolism of the soil microbes. Our results show that soil physical and chemical properties of the parental rock regulate microbial composition and carbon cycling.

TI  - Cadmium inhibits carbon and nitrogen cycling through soil microbial biomass and reduces soil nitrogen availability
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microbial mediated carbon and nitrogen cycling response to cadmium are often observed in soil; however, a unified framework of this response has not yet been established. By analyzing 1232 observations from 166 publications, we found that cadmium decreased microbial biomass carbon (-16 %) and nitrogen (-21 %), dissolved organic nitrogen (-27 %), nitrification rate (-17 %), microbial respiration rate (-12 %), and beta-1,4glucosidase (-21 %) and urease (-16 %) activities, but increased microbial metabolic quotient (+11 %) and fungal-to-bacterial ratio (+39 %). The cadmium impact was concentration-dependent, becoming more pronounced at higher concentrations. Increasing cadmium concentration reduced soil N mineralization rate and total N content, but increased microbial biomass carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. These results indicate that cadmium reduced carbon and nitrogen assimilation into microbial biomass and limited soil inorganic nitrogen production. Soil bulk density drove soil microbial biomass and nitrogen availability response to cadmium. Lower soil bulk density and higher initial carbon and clay contents and soil pH reduced the negative impact of cadmium on microbial biomass and nitrogen availability, suggesting that anthropogenic activities that enhance soil quality may mitigate the inhibitory effect of cadmium on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. Our analysis provides critical implications for improving our understanding of the ecological consequences of cadmium on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Metagenomic Insight Into Patterns and Mechanism of Nitrogen Cycle During Biocrust Succession
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The successional ecology of nitrogen cycling in biocrusts and the linkages to ecosystem processes remains unclear. To explore this, four successional stages of natural biocrust with five batches of repeated sampling and three developmental stages of simulated biocrust were studied using relative and absolute quantified multi-omics methods. A consistent pattern across all biocrust was found where ammonium assimilation, mineralization, dissimilatory nitrite to ammonium (DNiRA), and assimilatory nitrate to ammonium were abundant, while denitrification medium, N-fixation, and ammonia oxidation were low. Mathematic analysis showed that the nitrogen cycle in natural biocrust was driven by dissolved organic N and NO3-. pH and SO42- were the strongest variables affecting denitrification, while C:(N:P) was the strongest variable affecting N-fixation, DNiRA, nitrite oxidation, and dissimilatory nitrate to nitrite. Furthermore, N-fixation and DNiRA were closely related to elemental stoichiometry and redox balance, while assimilatory nitrite to ammonium (ANiRA) and mineralization were related to hydrological cycles. Together with the absolute quantification and network models, our results suggest that responsive ANiRA and mineralization decreased during biocrust succession; whereas central respiratory DNiRA, the final step of denitrification, and the complexity and interaction of the whole nitrogen cycle network increased. Therefore, our study stresses the changing environmental functions in the biocrust N-cycle, which are succession-dependent.

TI  - Response mechanisms of bacterial communities and nitrogen cycle functional genes in millet rhizosphere soil to chromium stress
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionA growing amount of heavy metal contamination in soil disturbs the ecosystem's equilibrium, in which microbial populations play a key role in the nutrient cycle of soils. However, given the different sensitivity of microbial communities to different spatial and temporal scales, microbial community structure and function also have varied response mechanisms to different heavy metal contaminated habitats. MethodsIn this study, samples were taken prior to Cr stress (CK) and 6 h and 6 days after Cr stress (Cr_6h, Cr_6d) in laboratory experiments. High-throughput sequencing revealed trends in the structure and diversity of the bacterial communities, and real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to analyze trends in nitrogen cycle functional genes (AOA-amoA, AOB-amoA, narG, nirK, and nifH). ResultsThe findings showed that (1) the composition structure of the soil bacterial community changed considerably in Cr-stressed soils; alpha-diversity showed significant phase transition characteristic from stress to stability (p < 0.05). (2) With an overall rising tendency, the abundance of the nitrogen cycle functional genes (AOA-amoA and AOB-amoA) decreased considerably before increasing, and alpha-diversity dramatically declined (p < 0.05). (3) The redundancy analysis (RDA) and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) tests results showed that the soil physicochemical parameters were significantly correlated with the nitrogen cycle functional genes (r: 0.4195, p < 0.01). Mantel analysis showed that available nitrogen (N), available potassium (K), and available phosphorus (P) were significantly correlated with nifH (p = 0.006, 0.008, 0.004), and pH was highly significantly correlated with nifH (p = 0.026). The PLS-ME (partial least squares path model) model further demonstrated a significant direct effect of the soil physicochemical parameters on the nitrogen cycling functional genes. DiscussionAs a result, the composition and diversity of the bacterial community and the nitrogen cycle functional genes in Cr-stressed agricultural soils changed considerably. However, the influence of the soil physicochemical parameters on the functional genes involved in the nitrogen cycle was greater than that of the bacterial community. and Cr stress affects the N cycling process in soil mainly by affecting nitrification. This research has significant practical ramifications for understanding the mechanisms of microbial community homeostasis maintenance, nitrogen cycle response mechanisms, and soil remediation in heavy metal-contaminated agricultural soils.

TI  - Nitrogen cycling and urban afforestation success in New York City
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Afforestation projects are a growing focus of urban restoration efforts to rehabilitate degraded landscapes and develop new forests. Urban forests provide myriad valuable ecosystem services essential for urban sustainability and resilience. These essential services are supported by natural soil microbial processes that transform organic matter to critical nutrients for plant community establishment and development. Nitrogen (N) is the most limiting nutrient in forest ecosystems, yet little information is known about N cycling in urban afforestation efforts. This study examined microbially mediated processes of carbon (C) and N cycling in 10 experimental afforested sites established across New York City parklands under the MillionTreesNYC initiative. Long-term research plots were established between 2009 and 2011 at each site with low and high diversity (two vs. six tree species) treatments. In 2018, 1-m soil cores were collected from plots at each site and analyzed for microbial biomass and respiration, potential net N mineralization, and nitrification, denitrification potential, soil inorganic N, and total soil N. Field observations revealed markedly different trajectories between sites that exhibited a closed canopy and leaf litter layer derived from trees that were planted and those that did not fit this description. These two metrics served to group sites into two categories (high vs. low) of afforestation success. We hypothesized that: (1) afforestation success would be correlated with rates of C and N cycling, (2) high diversity restoration techniques would affect these processes, and (3) inherent soil properties interact with plants and environmental conditions to affect the development of these processes over time. We found that high success sites had significantly higher rates of C and N cycling processes, but low and high diversity treatments showed no differences. Low success sites were more likely to have disturbed soil profiles with human-derived debris. Afforestation success appears to be driven by interactions between initial site conditions that facilitate plant community establishment and development that in turn enable N accumulation and cycling, creating positive feedbacks for success.

TI  - Effects of Three Antibiotics on Nitrogen-Cycling Bacteria in Sediment of Aquaculture Water
T2  - WATER
AB  - Antibiotics are commonly used to prevent and control aquaculture diseases. However, long-term overuse of antibiotics not only leaves residues but also leads to changes in the nitrogen cycle in water, which threatens the survival of aquaculture organisms. The current results showed that sulfamethoxazole had no significant effect on the nitrogen cycle process in the actual aquaculture concentration. The inhibitory effect of 1.05 mg/L norfloxacin on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria was significantly greater than that on ammonia-oxidizing archaea, and the gene abundance of AOB amoA on the 14th day increased by 2.48 times compared with the 7th day. Under the influence of 3.9 mg/L oxytetracycline, the gene abundance of AOB amoA decreased significantly, while the number of AOA amoA genes increased, suggesting that there may be functional redundancy between AOA and AOB. At the genus level in the norfloxacin group, the relative abundance of Sva0485 increased by 14.0% on the 7th day compared with the control group but decreased 12.77% in the addition group. The relative abundance of Firmicutes, another dominant species in the oxytetracycline group, was 25.9%. This study shows that the addition of antibiotics may have a negative effect on the nitrogen-cycling microorganisms in aquaculture water.

TI  - The global-scale impacts of metallic nanoparticles on soil carbon dioxide emissions
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems are increasingly being exposed to metallic nanoparticles (MNPs). However, the global-scale impact of MNPs on soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emission remains unknown, limiting our understanding of the role of MNPs in global carbon cycle. We compiled a dataset comprising 1764 pairs of experimental observations to investigate the effects of MNPs exposure on soil respiration parameters, including respiration rates, related enzyme activities, and microbial variables. We found that MNPs could stimulate or suppress soil basal respiration rates across global environments, depending largely on the type of MNPs. We further showed that, although the inhibition of MNPs on most enzyme activities peaked in short-term exposure (<= 28 days), prolonged exposure to MNPs still inhibited soil organic carbon degradation. Finally, we determined that environmental conditions (e.g., soil pH and presence/absence of plants) were also important regulators of the influence of MNPs on soil respiration parameters. Our findings underline that the effects of MNPs on soil CO2 emission depended on MNPs type, exposure design, and environmental factors, which is critical for predicting the role of MNPs in influencing the global carbon cycle and climate change.

TI  - Aridity Structures the Microbial Potential for Carbon Cycling and Mediates the Impact of Mammal Bioturbation at the Continental Scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Introduction: In Australia, the historical loss of native digging mammals has profoundly changed ecosystems and their functioning. However, little is known about how the decline in digging mammal presence alters microbes and their functional potential and how aridity affects these relationships. Materials and Methods: We used metagenomic sequencing to explore changes in genes encoding enzymes for carbon cycling (CAZymes) in five sites along a continent-wide aridity gradient, with and without digging mammals. Results: The diversity of CAZy genes was reduced with increases in aridity, which also affected their structure and reduced the abundance of genes involved in both plant (cellulose and starch) and microbial (glucans, peptidoglycan and chitin) biomass degradation. Conversely, digging mammals had a limited effect on the structure and diversity of CAZy genes, indicating an overall resistance of the microbial carbon cycling potential to mammal disturbance at the whole community level. However, when considering individual functional groups, digging activity increased the abundance of genes involved in microbial biomass decomposition (i.e., glucanases), while reducing the abundance of genes associated with recalcitrant plant biomass degradation (i.e., cellulases). Notably, these effects were observed only in the most arid sites and was mostly mediated by increases in SOM content linked to mammal activity. Conclusions: Overall, our study shows that aridity shapes the diversity and structure of CAZy genes, while also modulating the effect of mammal bioturbation on the microbial potential for carbon cycling. This suggests that the loss of digging mammals throughout much of Australia's arid zone, in particular, is likely to have important repercussions on the microbial capacity to carry decomposition processes and the turnover of organic matter in soils.

TI  - Microbial Diversity and Nitrogen Cycling in Peat and Marine Soils: A Review
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for living organisms in peat and marine soils, and its transformation within the soil matrix is a complex process mediated by various microbes that inhabit these ecological niches. The metabolism of nitrogen is governed by microbially mediated biogeochemical transformations, such as nitrification, anammox, and denitrification, which contribute to the assimilated pool of nitrogen and fixed nitrogen loss. One of the major challenges facing the field of peat and marine microbiology is the lack of understanding of the correlation between ecosystem-driven nitrogen transformation and microbial diversity. This is crucial because of growing concerns regarding the impacts of human-induced activities and global climate change on microbial nitrogen-cycling processes in peat and marine soils. Thus, this review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the microbial communities involved in peat and marine nitrification, anammox, and denitrification; the factors influencing the niche differentiation and distribution of the main functional components; the genes involved; and the main effects of human-induced activities and global climate change on the peat and marine nitrogen cycle. The implications of this review will facilitate an understanding of the complex mechanisms associated with ecosystem function in relation to nitrogen cycling, the role of peat and marine soils as carbon sinks, pollution remediation using naturally occurring populations of diverse microbes, and the development of policies to mitigate the effects of anthropogenic influences in peat and marine soils.

TI  - Water pH, not soil pH, alters bacterial community structural pattern and nitrogen cycling pathways in date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) roots and bulk soil under freshwater irrigation regime
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Date palms are widely cultivated in arid agroecosystems, where knowledge of irrigation water effect on their soil and root-associated bacterial communities is limited. Using 16S rDNA metabarcoding, we studied soil and root-associated bacterial communities of date palms growing in United Arab Emirates. Overall, 12.18% of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were unique to roots, whereas 41.55% were specific to soil. The bacterial diversity was lower in root and community patterns were distinct between compartments, wherein irrigation water pH was a key structuring factor in both compartments, while salinity (electrical conductivity) was important only in the soil. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed a decrease in complexity in the soil-root continuum, and specific taxa/modules also varied with water pH. We observed a higher abundance of endophyte-saprotroph (Bacillus, Streptomyces and Dongia) dual-role OTUs in both compartments, possibly involved in nutrient mobilisation and plant growth. Based on PICRUSt and trait-based analyses, we showed that these OTUs are putatively involved in the nitrogen cycle (nitrification, denitrification, and assimilatory nitrate reduction). Taken together, we suggest that irrigation water pH, not soil pH, transiently affects belowground bacterial communities and selects bacteria in specific pH ranges, which may be important for nutrient cycling (i.e. nitrogen cycle) in arid agroecosystems.

TI  - No-tillage effects on the soil nitrogen-cycling prokaryotic community inhabiting soil aggregates in upland fields
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - In no-tillage field soils, where degradation and erosion are minimized, soil aggregates form more readily, supporting a stable physical structure. These aggregates contain pores that serve as microhabitats for microbes involved in key biogeochemical processes, such as organic matter decomposition and redox reactions. In this study, we evaluated the physical and chemical properties of soils under different management practices (tillage vs. no-tillage) and conducted DNA metagenomic analysis to investigate microbial functions related to the nitrogen cycle. Long-term no-tillage led to the accumulation of persistent organic matter, which promoted the formation of soil aggregates. These aggregates maintained anaerobic microenvironments that suppressed organic matter decomposition in macro-aggregates. In the no-till soil, N2O emissions and nitrogen accumulation were observed. Metagenomic analysis of macro-aggregates revealed that the relative abundance of ammonia oxidation (amoA, amoB, and amoC) and nitric oxide reduction (norB and norC) genes were 0.53 and 0.66 times lower, respectively, in no-till soil aggregates than in tilled soil aggregates. Not only the relative abundance but also the player of nitrification differed between no-tilled and tilled soil aggregates. Additionally, the relative abundance of dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes (nrfA, nrfH, nirB, and nirD) was 1.4 times higher in the tilled soil aggregates than in the no-tilled soil aggregates. Microbial community analysis showed that no-tillage practices altered nitrogen-cycling microbes, inhibiting nitrification and denitrification while promoting dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia. These findings suggest that nitrogen cycling regulation in aggregates to accumulate nitrogen in no-tillage soils due to reduced microbial consumption and enhanced ammonia production.

TI  - Synthesizing the effects of large, wild herbivore exclusion on ecosystem function
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Wild large herbivores are declining worldwide. Despite extensive use of exclosure experiments to investigate herbivore impacts, there is little consensus on the effects of wild large herbivores on ecosystem function. Of the ecosystem functions likely impacted, we reviewed the five most-studied in exclosure experiments: ecosystem resilience/resistance to disturbance, nutrient cycling, carbon cycling, plant regeneration, and primary productivity. Experimental data on large wild herbivores' effects on ecosystem functions were predominately derived from temperate grasslands (50% grasslands, 75% temperate zones). Additionally, data were from experiments that may not be of adequate size (median size 400 m(2) despite excluding all experiments below 25 m(2)) or duration (median duration 6 years) to capture ecosystem-scale responses to these low-density and wide-ranging taxa. Wild herbivore removal frequently impacted ecosystem functions; for example, net carbon uptake increased by three times in some instances. However, the magnitude and direction of effects, even within a single function, were highly variable. A focus on carbon cycling highlighted challenges in interpreting effects on a single function. While the effect of large herbivore exclusion on carbon cycling was slightly positive when its components (e.g. pools vs. fluxes of carbon) were aggregated, effects on individual components were variable and sometimes opposed. Given modern declines in large wild herbivores, it is critical to understand their effects on ecosystem function. However, this synthesis highlights strong variability in direction, magnitude, and modifiers of these effects. Some variation is likely due to disparity in what components are used to describe a given function. For example, for the carbon cycle we identified eight distinctly meaningful components, which are not easily combined yet are potentially misrepresentative of the larger cycle when considered alone. However, much of the observed difference in responses likely reflects real ecological variability across complex systems. To move towards a general predictive framework we must identify where variation in effect is due to methodological differences and where due to ecosystem context. Two critical steps forward are (a) additional quantitative synthetic analyses of large herbivores' effects on individual functions, and (b) improved, increased systematic exclosure research focusing on effects of large herbivores' exclusion on functions.

TI  - Interaction between biochar and nitrogen fertilizer improves nitrogen utilization efficiency, closely connected with rhizosphere microbes involved in nitrogen-cycling
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Biochar is an eco-friendly amendment for improving nitrogen (N) utilization efficiency in agricultural ecosystems. However, the responses of N-cycling functional profiles of rhizosphere microbes to the co-application of biochar and N fertilizer remain greatly elusive. In this study, we designed a rhizo-box experiment with two biochar levels (0 and 2 %) and four nitrogen fertilizer application rates (N1, 0 mg kg-1; N2, 50 mg kg-1; N3, 100 mg kg-1; and N4, 200 mg kg-1) to investigate the effects of biochar and N fertilizer co-application on plant growth, nitrogen utilization efficiency, and rhizosphere microbial nitrogen-cycling functions. The results showed that biochar addition significantly promoted root biomass by 138.7 %, 192.6 %, 24.8 %, and 19.9 % under the N1, N2, N3, and N4 treatments, respectively. Additionally, nitrogen utilization efficiency was improved by 247.1 % and 29.3 % with biochar application under the N2 and N4 treatments. Meanwhile, metagenomic results revealed that rhizosphere microbes exhibited enhanced functions related to glutamate degradation, nitrate reduction and denitrification under the co-application of biochar and N fertilizer, while N fixation functions were inhibited. The variations in microbial N-cycling functions were driven by changes in key taxa involved in Ncycling (e.g., Sphingomonas, Sinomonas, and Streptomyces), which were closely correlated with NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations. Therefore, our results indicate that the improvement in nitrogen utilization efficiency due to the interaction between biochar and nitrogen fertilizer can be attributed to root proliferation, increased nitrogen availability, and feedback effects from rhizosphere microbes involved in nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Interspecific collaboration enhances the litter nutrient cycling and fungal network connectivity in mixed forests
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - Forest succession induced by pine wilt disease can result in changes in vegetation, thereby reducing timber production and impacting the input of belowground litter. Litter decomposition plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems. However, studies focusing on the litter decomposition process during forest succession are not common. Therefore, we investigated the decomposition rates of litter, enzyme activities, fungal communities, and functional genes in pine needles and twigs in pure (Pinus massoniana) and mixed (P. massoniana and Liquidambar formosana) forests over three consecutive years. The results indicated that the decomposition rate of pine needles ranges from 57.79 % to 74.53 %, while the decomposition rate of pine twigs ranges from 24.16 % to 60.57 %. There is no significant difference in the litter decomposition rates between mixed and pure forests. During litter decomposition, the activity of acid phosphatase in pure forests was consistently higher than in mixed forests. Pure forests recruited more unique fungi to participate in decomposition compared to mixed forests. The fungal network connections in mixed forests are more complex than those in pure forests, and they become even more complex in the later stages of decomposition. There are differences in functional gene structure between mixed and pure forests, with an increase in the abundance of nitrogen cycle genes (nirK1, nirK2, nirK3, nirS1, nirS2) and phosphorus cycle genes (phoX) in mixed forests, thereby promoting nutrient cycling. In summary, these research results provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate ecosystem functions and fungal community during forest succession.

TI  - Shifts in soil microorganisms in response to warming are consistent across a range of Antarctic environments
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Because of severe abiotic limitations, Antarctic soils represent simplified systems, where microorganisms are the principal drivers of nutrient cycling. This relative simplicity makes these ecosystems particularly vulnerable to perturbations, like global warming, and the Antarctic Peninsula is among the most rapidly warming regions on the planet. However, the consequences of the ongoing warming of Antarctica on microorganisms and the processes they mediate are unknown. Here, using 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and qPCR, we report highly consistent responses in microbial communities across disparate sub-Antarctic and Antarctic environments in response to 3 years of experimental field warming (+0.5 to 2 degrees C). Specifically, we found significant increases in the abundance of fungi and bacteria and in the Alphaproteobacteria-to-Acidobacteria ratio, which could result in an increase in soil respiration. Furthermore, shifts toward generalist bacterial communities following warming weakened the linkage between the bacterial taxonomic and functional richness. GeoChip microarray analyses also revealed significant warming effects on functional communities, specifically in the N-cycling microorganisms. Our results demonstrate that soil microorganisms across a range of sub-Antarctic and Antarctic environments can respond consistently and rapidly to increasing temperatures.

TI  - Effects of a long-term anoxic warming scenario on microbial community structure and functional potential of permafrost-affected soil
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
AB  - Permafrost (PF)-affected soils are widespread in the Arctic and store about half the global soil organic carbon. This large carbon pool becomes vulnerable to microbial decomposition through PF warming and deepening of the seasonal thaw layer (active layer [AL]). Here we combined greenhouse gas (GHG) production rate measurements with a metagenome-based assessment of the microbial taxonomic and metabolic potential before and after 5 years of incubation under anoxic conditions at a constant temperature of 4 degrees C in the AL, PF transition layer, and intact PF. Warming led to a rapid initial release of CO2 and, to a lesser extent, CH4 in all layers. After the initial pulse, especially in CO2 production, GHG production rates declined and conditions became more methanogenic. Functional gene-based analyses indicated a decrease in carbon- and nitrogen-cycling genes and a community shift to the degradation of less-labile organic matter. This study reveals low but continuous GHG production in long-term warming scenarios, which coincides with a decrease in the relative abundance of major metabolic pathway genes and an increase in carbohydrate-active enzyme classes.

TI  - Microbial processes and features of the microbiota in histosols from a black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) forest
T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Microbiological features and in situ microbial activities were analyzed in soils at a black alder forest adjacent to the eutrophic Lake Belau during the course of the interdisciplinary program, "Ecosystem Research in the Bornhoved Lake District." The microbiological data were combined to evaluate the functional status of the Histosols. It was hypothesized that carbon accumulation typical for Histosols would mainly take place at the wet part ("wet site") close to the lake shore and not at the drier part ("dry site") of the forest. Rates of leaf litter decomposition, in situ soil C mineralization, and in situ N-2-fixation were higher at the wet site. Furthermore, the composition of the bacterial communities and the presence of ectomycorrhizas indicated sufficient O-2 availability and high microbial vitality in the soil at the wet site. An anthropogenic lowering of the lake water table during the 1930s seems still to control the actual soil conditions, resulting in humus degradation in the two Histosols of the forest. The two soils clearly differed in productivity and C and N cycling, being controlled either by upland, acid runoff or by eutrophic lake water. Lake water seems to buffer but also to intensify microbial transformations at the wet site and to supply nutrients, although humus decay may possible be decelerated by a temporarily high water table and refractory humic substances.

TI  - Soil environment, carbon and nitrogen cycle functional genes in response to freeze-thaw cycles and biochar
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) are a common phenomenon in seasonal frozen soil areas, which can significantly affect the changes in the soil environment and functional genes of microorganisms. To explore the effect of biochar application on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling under FTCs, an indoor soil column simulation test was used in this study. The experimental setup included different application rates of biochar (0%, 1%, 2%), with the carbon and nitrogen cycle functional genes serving as indicator genes. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR technology was employed for analysis. Based on the correlation heat map and redundancy analysis (RDA), the response mechanism of soil environment changes and carbon and nitrogen cycle functional genes before and after FTCs was analyzed. The results revealed that the application of biochar significantly increased soil's waterholding capacity held available nutrients in soil, and increased the ability of environmental change. Due to the influence of soil moisture and aeration, biochar reduced the variation of soil carbon sequestration gene cbbL, cbbM, and nitrogen fixation gene nifH abundance after FTCs. The application of 2 % biochar significantly increased the abundance of the nitrification gene amoA and denitrification gene nirK and enhanced the respiration of soil microorganisms. Soil moisture (SM) is the main environmental factor that determines the abundance changes of the soil carbon sequestration genes cbbL and cbbM. Soil organic matter (SOM), pH, nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) were the main environmental factors determining the abundance of soil nitrogen fixation gene nifH, nitrification gene amoA, and denitrification gene nirK. This study can provide new insights into the internal mechanism of the soil carbon and nitrogen cycle in seasonal frozen soil areas, and provide some reference for the rational application of biochar and the efficient utilization of water and soil resources in seasonal frozen soil areas in the future.

TI  - Changes in land use driven by urbanization impact nitrogen cycling and the microbial community composition in soils
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Transition of populations from rural to urban living causes landscape changes and alters the functionality of soil ecosystems. It is unclear how this urbanization disturbs the microbial ecology of soils and how the disruption influences nitrogen cycling. In this study, microbial communities in turfgrass-grown soils from urban and suburban areas around Xiamen City were compared to microbial communities in the soils from rural farmlands. The potential N2O emissions, potential denitrification activity, and abundances of denitrifiers were higher in the rural farmland soils compared with the turfgrass soils. Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) were more abundant than ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in turfgrass soils. Within turfgrass soils, the potential nitrification activities and AOA abundances were higher in the urban than in the suburban soils. These results indicate a more pivotal role of AOA in nitrification, especially in urban soils. Microbial community composition was distinctly grouped along urbanization categories (urban, suburban, and rural) classified according to the population density, which can in part be attributed to the differences in soil properties. These observed changes could potentially have a broader impact on soil nutrient availability and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Response of microbial community diversity and the abundance of nitrogen-cycling genes to Bacillus subtilis application in mulberry field soil
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Context. Bacillus subtilis (BS) is a widely used microbial agent that could improve soil fertility and soil microenvironment. There is still uncertainty about the suitability of BS for cultivating crops with high demand for nitrogen fertiliser. Aims. To evaluate the effects of BS agent on microbial community diversity and nitrogen-cycling genes in mulberry rhizosphere soil. Methods. Pot experiments were conducted. Different dosages (CK, 0; T1, 0.5 x 10(6) CFU g(-1) soil; T2, 1 x 10(6) CFU g(-1) soil; T3, 2 x 10(6) CFU g(-1) soil) of BS agent were applied to irrigate the mulberry soil. The soil nutrient content, enzyme activity, bacterial community, and nitrogen-cycling genes were determined. Key results. T1 had the highest Chao1 and Shannon index, while T3 had the lowest. BS-treated samples had higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi than that of CK. Specially, BS-treated samples had higher relative abundance of Sphingomonas, Reyranella, and Hyphomicrobium, which was significantly positively correlated with the content of organic matter, total soluble nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and the activity of sucrase. The abundance of genes involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, metabolism of cofactors, and vitamin functions also increased in the BS-treated samples. BS treatment significantly increased the abundance of AOA-amoA and nirK genes, but decreased the abundance of nirS and nifH genes. Conclusions. An appropriate amount of BS agent could improve soil fertility, regulate the dominant bacterium communities, and affect the abundance of functional genes involved in nitrogen cycling. Implications. BS is probably a good choice for mulberry cultivation to improve nitrogen fertiliser utilisation efficiency.

TI  - The Global Climate Change over the Cenozoic Considered from the Carbon Cycle
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI
AB  - The global carbon cycle controls the climate change in the Earth's environment on a geological timescale and is mainly associated with greenhouse effects produced by atmospheric carbon dioxide(CO2) and methane(CH4). This paper reviews the relationship between the global carbon cycle and presumed climate events during the Cenozoic.
   The global carbon cycle is primarily regulated by the balance between weathering and metamorphism- volcanism. Moreover, the organic carbon subcycle involving oxidative weathering and burial is of secondary importance. The balance of these geochemical processes results in variations of atmospheric CO2.
   The past climate on a geological time scale is reconstructed by several geochemical and paleontological methods or proxies. For example, sea-surface and deep-water temperature are deduced from oxygen isotope ratio and Mg/Ca ratio of foraminiferal tests. Terrestrial atmospheric temperature is estimated from leaf fossil and paleovegetation. Atmospheric CO2 level is calculated from carbon isotope ratios of phytoplankton and soil carbonate, stomatal density of leaf fossil, boron isotope ratio of foraminiferal test, Ce anomaly, and global carbon cycle modeling. It is important to consider their advantages and disadvantages in order to evaluate the paleoclimate adequately.
   Next, we discuss climate change based on these proxies. As a general trend, the Cenozoic climate change is characterized by a transition from ice-free to ice-covered conditions across the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. The Earth's surface environment was significantly warmed from the Paleocene to the Eocene by high levels of atmospheric CO2. Thereafter, it gradually cooled towards the present, which is possibly attributed to changes in ocean currents and other marine environments accompanying continental drift. This trend has been punctuated by several short-term climate events. The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum(PETM) was a remarkable warming event at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, possibly attributed to the release of methane from hydrates into the atmosphere. Rapid cooling occurred at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary to form extensive continental ice sheets including the Antarctica, which seems to have been caused by atmospheric CO2 and change of oceanographic circulation and marine environment. After a moderate period from the late Oligocene to the early Miocene, there was a transient but significant warming in the middle Miocene. Since then, the Earth's environment has gradually cooled towards the present accompanied by the evolution of glaciations and marine environmental changes but a causal link between cooling and global carbon cycle has recently been pointed out.

TI  - Carbon cycle in tropical upland ecosystems: a global review
T2  - WEB ECOLOGY
AB  - Along with habitat transformation, climate change has profound impacts on biodiversity and may alter ecosystem services on which human welfare depends. Many studies of the carbon cycle have focused on lowland tropical forests; however, upland forests have been less explored despite their pivotal role in carbon sequestration. Here, I synthesized the state of knowledge on the allocation of carbon in its different stocks (aboveground, belowground, and soil) as well as in its main fluxes (plant decomposition, respiration, and litterfall) in tropical upland ecosystems of the planet. In November 2020, a systematic review was carried out to identify references published from 2000 to 2020 through a combination of key terms in Google Scholar and Scopus databases, thus analysing bibliographic, geographical, methodological, and carbon cycling information of the global upland tropics (between 23.5 degrees N-23.5 degrees S). After analysing a total of 1967 references according to inclusion-exclusion criteria, 135 references published in the last 20 years were selected. Most of the studies were conducted in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest of South America. The main factors studied were elevation and forest type. Forest structure and soil variables were largely associated when studying carbon cycling in these ecosystems. Estimations of carbon stocks comprised three-fourths of the total studies, while the remaining fraction focused on carbon fluxes. Aboveground biomass and carbon in soils were highly investigated, while plant decomposition and respiration were the components that received the least attention. Even though in the last 20 years there was a slight increase in the number of studies on carbon cycle in tropical upland forests, I found bias associated with the biomes and ecoregions studied (especially in the Andes). Elevation was the main factor examined but other essential aspects such as the successional gradient, landscape management, diversity- productivity relationship, faunal and microbial effect, trophic cascades, and Gadgil effect require more attention. The inclusion of different litter species and origins (i.e. roots and stems) and theoretical frameworks including home-field advantage, substrate-matrix interaction, and phenology-substrate match may provide explanatory mechanisms to better understand litter decomposition over these forests. Despite respiration being a paramount link that is closely tied to above- and belowground compartment, this flux constitutes one of the important gaps to fulfil in future research. For a comprehensive understanding of the carbon cycle in upland forests, it is necessary to obtain information on its main fluxes and integrate them into climate change mitigation plans.

TI  - Plant-derived inputs drive soil microbial and nutrient dynamics in subalpine Picea asperata plantations
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - BackgroundThe conversion of natural forests to plantations has substantially altered soil properties and ecosystem functions. However, the mechanisms by which planted tree species regulate soil abiotic and biotic factors through plant-derived inputs remain poorly understood.MethodsA controlled laboratory experiment was conducted with five treatments-root exudates (RE), litter decomposition (LL), leaf leachates (ML), combined inputs (ALL), and control (CK)-to evaluate the regulatory effects of plant-derived inputs on soil. Metagenomic sequencing and physicochemical analyses were used to assess their impacts on soil properties, microbial communities, nutrient cycling genes, and plant growth.ResultsML increased nitrate nitrogen (4.09 +/- 0.48 mg/kg) while decreased ammonium nitrogen (18.41 +/- 1.92 mg/kg), exacerbating soil acidification. In contrast, LL increased ammonium nitrogen (39.60 +/- 3.08 mg/kg) and decreased nitrate nitrogen (2.54 +/- 0.34 mg/kg), mitigating acidification. Soil pH explained 51% of the variation in microbial community composition. Microbial diversity was lowest in RE and highest in LL. Plant-derived inputs increased the abundance of microbial functional genes, with LL primarily influencing carbon and nitrogen cycling, while ML and RE enhanced phosphorus cycling. Microbial communities significantly impacted herbaceous plant growth, but no effects were observed on woody plants under controlled conditions without plant competition.ConclusionsThese results highlight the distinct roles of plant-derived inputs in shaping soil properties and microbial communities. Managing these inputs, particularly by promoting litter decomposition, can mitigate soil acidification, enhance microbial diversity, and support sustainable plantation management. Future research should incorporate field-based ecological interactions to further refine these findings.

TI  - Indole-mediated reconfiguration of soil microbial consortia in response to microplastic pollution
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Microplastics, pervasive pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems, compromise soil health by disrupting microbial diversity and metabolic functions. Indole, a microbial signaling molecule known to regulate quorum sensing and stress adaptation, emerges as a potential mitigator of these disturbances, yet its capacity to counteract microplastic-induced dysbiosis remains uncharacterized. This study investigates how indole reconfigures microbial consortia to enhance ecological resilience under polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) pollution, employing high-throughput sequencing techniques. The findings revealed that indole significantly enhanced the proliferation of specific bacterial genera, such as Pseudomonas and Bacillus, as well as specific fungal genera, including Trichoderma, Pseudeurotium, and Aspergillus, while increasing their centrality within the microbial network. Compared to the treatment involving only microplastics, the indole treatment notably reduced the impact of microbial community dispersal limitations and enhanced the role of homogeneous selection. A partial least squares discriminant analysis revealed that indole significantly interacted with PE and PS, influencing soil microbial community structure. Moreover, FAPROTAX functional predictions indicated that indole treatment markedly enhanced the metabolic functions of soil microorganisms, including those related to predation or parasitism, the carbon cycle, and the nitrogen cycle, while reducing the relative abundance of potential fungal pathogens. This study indicated the beneficial regulatory effect of indole on the ecological function of microorganisms in soil contaminated by microplastics.

TI  - The effect of ecological farming techniques on nitrogen cycling microorganisms in soils with coffee plantations
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA
AB  - Ecological agriculture promotes an interactive system for the sustainability of soil and agroecosystems, leveraging and optimizing available resources to improve the quality of the cultivated soil. This research aims at evaluating the physical, chemical, and microorganism changes in the nitrogen cycle of the soil after applying ecological farming techniques such as liquid humus, solid humus, efficient microorganisms, biol, poultry manure, phosphites, polyculture stimulation and green manures, in coffee plantations of different ages. For this evaluation, we collected soil samples in plots cultivated with zero-, two-, and fouryear-old coffee trees during months zero, four, and ten. We determined the physical and chemical parameters and abundance of microorganisms associated with the nitrogen cycle (ammonifiers (AMO), proteolytic (PRO), ammonium oxidizing (BOA), nitrite oxidizing (BON) and denitrifiers (DEN). The results showed statistically significant changes in soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content as a result of applying ecological farming techniques, which were applied sequentially and evaluated as a set over time. These statistically significant differences occurred in the different months evaluated and in month 10 in contrast to month zero of application of techniques. However, no statistically significant changes were found in the abundance of microorganisms in the nitrogen cycle. In addition, direct relationships were obtained between variables such as P and %OC; pH and DEN; and BON and AMO. It can be concluded that although the application of organic farming techniques improves the physical and chemical properties of soils, there are no statistically significant differences in the abundance of nitrogen cycle microorganisms.

TI  - Species-driven changes in nitrogen cycling can provide a mechanism for plant invasions
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Traits that permit successful invasions have often seemed idiosyncratic, and the key biological traits identified vary widely among species. This fundamentally limits our ability to determine the invasion potential of a species. However, ultimately, successful invaders must have positive growth rates that longer term result in higher biomass accumulation than competing established species. In many terrestrial ecosystems nitrogen limits plant growth, and is a key factor determining productivity and the outcome of competition among species. Plant nitrogen use may provide a powerful framework to evaluate the invasive potential of a species in nitrogen-limiting ecosystems. Six mechanisms influence plant nitrogen use or acquisition: photosynthetic tissue allocation, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, nitrogen fixation, nitrogen-leaching losses, gross nitrogen mineralization, and plant nitrogen residence time. Here we show that among these alternatives, the key mechanism allowing invasion for Pinus strobus into nitrogen limited grasslands was its higher nitrogen residence time. This higher nitrogen residence time created a positive feedback that redistributed nitrogen from the soil into the plant. This positive feedback allowed P. strobus to accumulate twice as much nitrogen in its tissues and four times as much nitrogen to photosynthetic tissues, as compared with other plant species. In turn, this larger leaf nitrogen pool increased total plant carbon gain of P. strobus two- to sevenfold as compared with other plant species. Thus our data illustrate that plant species can change internal ecosystem nitrogen cycling feedbacks and this mechanism can allow them to gain a competitive advantage over other plant species.

TI  - Thinning promotes the nitrogen and phosphorous cycling in forest soils
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Thinning, a major practice of even-aged forest management, notably affects the stand structure and microclimates and thus in turn soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) cycling. However, the magnitude and direction of these effects remain uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis of 1228 observations from 115 studies worldwide to explore the effects of thinning on forest soil N and P processes. The results showed that thinning increased the concentrations of soil nitrate, total P, and available P by 11.7%, 6.1%, and 11.4%, respectively, but had no effect on the concentrations of soil total N and ammonium. Thinning stimulated soil microbial activities regulating soil N and P cycling, evidenced by the increased microbial biomass N and the activities of N- and P-acquiring extracellular enzymes. Thinning also increased net N mineralization and nitrification rates, but did not significantly affect N2O emission. However, these thinning effects varied with climates and forest biomes. The effect sizes of N-cycling processes were significantly correlated with mean annual precipitation or mean annual temperature, implying that these N fluxes are more sensitive to thinning in warm and humid regions. Collectively, our meta-analysis indicates that thinning promotes forest soil N and P cycling and increases the soil fertility, which are conducive to improving forest ecosystem functions.

TI  - Biological and physical effects of non-native earthworms on nitrogen cycling in riparian soils
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Global nitrogen cycling is being altered by anthropogenic disturbances including invasion by non-native species. European and Asian earthworms have invaded northern temperate forests in North America with dramatic consequences for litter thickness, forest floor plant diversity, and soil nitrogen cycling. Invasive earthworms present at the boundary of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (i.e., riparian zones) may alter the flux of nitrogen into adjacent aquatic ecosystems. We examined how nitrogen cycling in riparian soil responds to amendments of invasive earthworms or artificial earthworm burrows. In earthworm-free riparian plots (0.25 m(2)), we established treatments of invasive earthworms (60 g fresh mass. m(-2)), artificial burrows (120 m(-2)), or control plots and sampled the plots after 30 days. Before and after treatment application we measured major soil characteristics (water-filled pore space, organic matter, and pH), nitrogen pools (exchangeable NH4+ and NO3-), and nitrogen transformation rates (net N- mineralization, net nitrification, and denitrification). Exchangeable NH4+ and NO3- changed through time but did not differ among treatments. Net N-mineralization and net nitrification rates did not change through time and were similar across all treatments. However, denitrification rates in plots with added earthworms were 4 times greater than rates in control and burrow-only plots, which represents a large rapid increase in gaseous nitrogen flux out of these riparian soils. For all response variables, artificial burrows responded similarly to control plots, suggesting that earthworm biological activity (i.e., feeding, excretion, and mucus production) rather than physical effects (i.e., burrowing and soil aeration) drove the changes in nitrogen cycling. Examination of soil nitrogen pool and flux measurements suggest that this increase in denitrification was coupled with NH4+ consumption by nitrifying bacteria, but future studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. We conclude that the activity of invasive earthworms in riparian zones can increase the flux of N out of riparian zones, but the hydrologic context of the riparian zone (e.g., pore-water residence time) ultimately controls whether denitrification or nitrate leaching is the dominant flux of N.

TI  - Ecological distribution and potential roles of Woesearchaeota in anaerobic biogeochemical cycling unveiled by genomic analysis
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Woesearchaeota as a newly established member of the superphylum DPANN (Diapherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota and Nanohaloarchaea) are surprisingly abundant and diverse in a wide variety of environments, including deep oil reservoir, sulfuric springs and anoxic aquifers, indicating a high diversity of their roles in global biogeochemical cycles. However, ecological functions of them remain elusive. To fill up this gap, we analyzed and compared the global distribution patterns of Woesearchaeota using the genomes available publicly. As a result, both ecological distribution patterns and metabolic predictions support a key role of woesearchaeotal lineages in cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Multivariate regression analysis reveals that Woesearchaeota might function in consortium with methanogens in the cycling of carbon in anaerobic environments, particularly in soils or sediments. Moreover, comparative genomic analysis and ecological distribution suggest the potential roles of Woesearchaeota in the processes of denitrification, nitrogen fixation, and dissimilatory nitrite reduction, especially in the wastewater treatment systems; and also uncovered the potential capability of sulfate reduction, sulfide oxidation and thiosulfate oxidation in sulfuric or sulfidic-rich environments. Our findings add more information into the ecological roles of archaea in the anoxic environment. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Human disturbance affects enzyme activity, microbial biomass and organic carbon in tropical dry sub-humid pasture and forest soils
T2  - ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - The Brazilian dry forest occupies an area of about 1 million km(2) approximately 46% of which has been deforested. Many studies have been done on the effects of this on productivity and soil chemical attributes. However, little is known about soil enzymatic activity, which is sensitive to environmental changes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of deforestation using different levels of human disturbance on soil enzyme activities, organic carbon content, microbial biomass, and microbial community. We studied areas covered with forest (TDF), old grass (OG), or new grass (NG). Soils from NG had increased microorganisms, which restored important processes related to carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycling, so that they resembled those in the forested area. The results of this study showed that the conversion of forest to pasture with a high level of human disturbance could decrease the activities of beta-glucosidase, urease, alkaline phosphatase, and fluorescein diacetate in the soil by up to 87%, 66%, 62%, and 58%, respectively. These findings suggest that human disturbance can cause substantial changes in the enzymatic activity and microbial community in the soil. We suggest that maintaining grass pasture with low human disturbance should have fewer impacts on soil quality.

TI  - Global research trends on the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on the soil carbon cycle: A bibliometric analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play an indispensable role in terrestrial ecosystem soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. Over the past 22 years, numerous researchers have studied the role of AMF on soil the carbon cycle, thereby producing a wealth of knowledge. However, a comprehensive summary and analysis of the basic characteristics, research outputs, and knowledge base is still lacking. To explore the authors, countries, institutions, and keywords involved in the study of AMF effects on the soil carbon cycle, publications between 2001 and 2022 were identified and extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection databases using specific keywords, and a bibliometric analysis conducted on this data using CiteSpace. The number of publications has gradually increased over time, with a notable acceleration from 2017 onward. Most of the authors did not cooperate on a regular basis, and a stable cooperative group had not yet been formed among the core authors. The Chinese Academy of Sciences produced the largest number of publications among research institutions. Specifically, China published the largest number of articles in terms of national contributions, but had less influence in collaborative networks. The most desirable research topics mainly included nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients, root colonization, diversity, organic matter and organic carbon, plant growth, and microbial community. In more recent years, research seemed to focus more on AMF-mediated carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, nutrient exchange, alterations in microbial community structure, advancements in research techniques and methods, and in-depth studies into related mechanisms. This study serves as a valuable reference for future researchers interested in the effects of AMF on the soil carbon cycle, and provides guidelines for future innovative research.

TI  - Microbial keystone taxa and nitrogen cycling enzymes driven by the initial quality of litter jointly promoted the litter decomposition rates in the Tengger Desert, northern China
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The initial quality of litter, specifically the chemical composition, is an important factor in determining litter decomposition rates (K). However, further investigation is imperative to elucidate the underlying mechanism governing the impact of initial litter quality on K. We conducted a 420-day field litter decomposition experiment in the artificial sand-binding vegetation area in the southeastern edge of the Tengger Desert. We measured the 5 typical sand-fixing plants initial chemical composition of litter, soil microbial community, soil extracellular enzyme activity (EEAs) after 420-day of litter decomposition. The initial chemical composition of litter is an important factor in determining the K, and the initial content of Nitrogen (N), Carbon (C), and cellulose in litter (LitterPC2) increasing the abundance of positive taxa Ascomycota, Agromyces, and Preussia, while decreasing the abundance of negative taxa Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadota, Chytridiomycota and Aspergillus, thereby collectively enhancing the activity of nitrogen cycling enzymes and oxidase, ultimately promoting K. The lignin, lignin/N, and C/N (LitterPC1) enhance K through nitrogen cycling enzymes stimulating oxidase activity, but reduce microbial biomass carbon (MBC)/ microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) further inhibit the activity of enzyme C/N, thereby inhibiting decomposition. Overall, the energy and nutrient of litter initial quality regulate K by influencing the microbial keystone taxa and EEAs, which provides reference for species selection and reasonable collocation of artificial sand-binding vegetation in sandy area and also provide a scientific foundation for future management and stability maintenance of artificial vegetation.

TI  - The Effects of Mixed Robinia pseudoacacia and Quercus variabilis Plantation on Soil Bacterial Community Structure and Nitrogen-Cycling Gene Abundance in the Southern Taihang Mountain Foothills
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Mixed forests often increase their stability and species richness in comparison to pure stands. However, a comprehensive understanding of the effects of mixed forests on soil properties, bacterial community diversity, and soil nitrogen cycling remains elusive. This study investigated soil samples from pure Robinia pseudoacacia stands, pure Quercus variabilis stands, and mixed stands of both species in the southern foothills of the Taihang Mountains. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR, this study analyzed the bacterial community structure and the abundance of nitrogen-cycling functional genes within soils from different stands. The results demonstrated that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacterial groups across all three forest soil types. The mixed-forest soil exhibited a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, while Nitrospirae and Crenarchaeota were most abundant in the pure R. pseudoacacia stand soils. Employing FAPROTAX for predictive bacterial function analysis in various soil layers, this study found that nitrogen-cycling processes such as nitrification and denitrification were most prominent in pure R. pseudoacacia soils. Whether in surface or deeper soil layers, the abundance of AOB amoA, nirS, and nirK genes was typically highest in pure R. pseudoacacia stand soils. In conclusion, the mixed forest of R. pseudoacacia and Q. variabilis can moderate the intensity of nitrification and denitrification processes, consequently reducing soil nitrogen loss.

TI  - Decelerated carbon cycling by ectomycorrhizal fungi is controlled by substrate quality and community composition
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Interactions between symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EM) and free-living saprotrophs can result in significant deceleration of leaf litter decomposition. While this phenomenon is widely cited, its generality remains unclear, as both the direction and magnitude of EM fungal effects on leaf litter decomposition have been shown to vary among studies. Here we explicitly examine how contrasting leaf litter types and EM fungal communities may lead to differential effects on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Specifically, we measured the response of soil nutrient cycling, litter decay rates, litter chemistry and fungal community structure to the reduction of EM fungi (via trenching) with a reciprocal litter transplant experiment in adjacent Pinus- or Quercus-dominated sites. We found clear evidence of EM fungal suppression of C and N cycling in the Pinus-dominated site, but no suppression in the Quercus-dominated site. Additionally, in the Pinus-dominated site, only the Pinus litter decay rates were decelerated by EM fungi and were associated with decoupling of litter C and N cycling. Our results support the hypothesis that EM fungi can decelerate C cycling via N competition, but strongly suggest that the 'Gadgil effect' is dependent on both substrate quality and EM fungal community composition. We argue that understanding tree host traits as well as EM fungal functional diversity is critical to a more mechanistic understanding of how EM fungi mediate forest soil biogeochemical cycling.

TI  - Effects of Fire on Soil Bacterial Communities and Nitrogen Cycling Functions in Greater Khingan Mountains Larch Forests
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Investigating the effects of fire disturbance on soil microbial diversity and nitrogen cycling is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying soil nitrogen cycling. This study examined the fire burn site of the Larix gmelinii forest in the Greater Khingan Mountains, Inner Mongolia, to analyze the impact of varying fire intensities on soil nitrogen, microbial communities, and the abundance of nitrogen cycle-related functional genes after three years. The results indicated the following findings: (1) Soil bulk density increased significantly following severe fires (7.06%similar to 10.84%, p < 0.05), whereas soil water content decreased with increasing fire intensity (6.62%similar to 19.42%, p < 0.05). The soil total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen levels declined after heavy fires but increased after mild fires; (2) Mild fire burning significantly increased soil bacterial diversity, while heavy fire had a lesser effect. Dominant bacterial groups included Xanthobacteraceae, norank_o_norank_c_AD3, and norank_o_Elsterales. Norank_o_norank_c_AD3 abundance decreased with burn intensity (7.90% unburned, 3.02% mild fire, 2.70% heavy fire). Conversely, norank_o_Elsterales increased with burning (1.23% unburned, 5.66% mild fire, 5.48% heavy fire); (3) The abundance of nitrogen-fixing nifH functional genes decreased with increasing fire intensity, whereas nitrification functional genes amoA-AOA and amoA-AOB exhibited the opposite trend. Light-intensity fires increased the abundance of denitrification functional genes nirK, nirS, and nosZ, while heavy fires reduced their abundance; (4) The correlation analysis demonstrated a strong association between soil bacteria and denitrification functional genes nifH and amoA-AOA, with soil total nitrogen being a key factor influencing the nitrogen cycle-related functional genes. The primary bacterial groups involved in soil nitrogen cycling were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. These findings play a critical role in promoting vegetation regeneration and rapid ecosystem restoration in fire-affected areas.

TI  - Invasive species' leaf traits and dissimilarity from natives shape their impact on nitrogen cycling: a meta-analysis
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Many exotic species have little apparent impact on ecosystem processes, whereas others have dramatic consequences for human and ecosystem health. There is growing evidence that invasions foster eutrophication. We need to identify species that are harmful and systems that are vulnerable to anticipate these consequences. Species' traits may provide the necessary insights.
   We conducted a global meta-analysis to determine whether plant leaf and litter functional traits, and particularly leaf and litter nitrogen (N) content and carbon: nitrogen (C : N) ratio, explain variation in invasive species' impacts on soil N cycling.
   Dissimilarity in leaf and litter traits among invaded and noninvaded plant communities control the magnitude and direction of invasion impacts on N cycling. Invasions that caused the greatest increases in soil inorganic N and mineralization rates had a much greater litter N content and lower litter C : N in the invaded than the reference community. Trait dissimilarities were better predictors than the trait values of invasive species alone.
   Quantifying baseline community tissue traits, in addition to those of the invasive species, is critical to understanding the impacts of invasion on soil N cycling.

TI  - Top consumer abundance influences lake methane efflux
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Lakes are important habitats for biogeochemical cycling of carbon. The organization and structure of aquatic communities influences the biogeochemical interactions between lakes and the atmosphere. Understanding how trophic structure regulates ecosystem functions and influences greenhouse gas efflux from lakes is critical to understanding global carbon cycling and climate change. With a whole-lake experiment in which a previously fishless lake was divided into two treatment basins where fish abundance was manipulated, we show how a trophic cascade from fish to microbes affects methane efflux to the atmosphere. Here, fish exert high grazing pressure and remove nearly all zooplankton. This reduction in zooplankton density increases the abundance of methanotrophic bacteria, which in turn reduce CH4 efflux rates by roughly 10 times. Given that globally there are millions of lakes emitting methane, an important greenhouse gas, our findings that aquatic trophic interactions significantly influence the biogeochemical cycle of methane has important implications.

TI  - Impact of Biochar on Nitrogen-Cycling Functional Genes: A Comparative Study in Mollisol and Alkaline Soils
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Biochar has gained considerable attention as a sustainable soil amendment due to its potential to enhance soil fertility and mitigate nitrogen (N) losses. This study aimed to investigate the effects of biochar application on the abundance of key N-cycling genes in Mollisol and alkaline soils, focusing on nitrification (AOA, AOB, and nxrB) and denitrification (narG, norB, and nosZ) processes. The experiment was conducted using soybean rhizosphere soil. The results demonstrated that biochar significantly altered the microbial community structure by modulating the abundance of these functional genes. Specifically, biochar reduced narG and nosZ abundance in both soil types, indicating a potential reduction in N2O emissions. In contrast, it promoted the abundance of nxrB, particularly in alkaline soils, suggesting enhanced nitrite oxidation. The study also revealed strong correlations between N-cycling gene abundances and soil properties such as pH, EC (electrical conductivity. Biochar improved soil pH and nutrient availability, creating favorable conditions for AOB and Nitrospira populations, which play key roles in ammonia and nitrite oxidation. Additionally, the reduction in norB/nosZ ratios in biochar-treated soils suggests a shift towards more efficient N2O reduction. These findings highlight biochar's dual role in enhancing soil fertility and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in Mollisol and alkaline soils. The results provide valuable insights into the sustainable management of agricultural soils through biochar application, emphasizing its potential to optimize nitrogen-cycling processes and improve soil health. Further research is needed to explore the long-term impacts of biochar on microbial communities and nitrogen-cycling under field conditions.

TI  - Mulches assist degraded soil recovery via stimulating biogeochemical cycling: metagenomic analysis
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Soil degradation of urban greening has caused soil fertility loss and soil organic carbon depletion. Organic mulches are made from natural origin materials, and represent a cost-effective and environment-friendly remediation method for urban greening. To reveal the effects of organic mulch on soil physicochemical characteristics and fertility, we selected a site that was covered with organic mulch for 6 years and a nearby lawn-covered site. The results showed that soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus levels were improved, especially at a depth of 0-20 cm. The activities of cellulase, invertase, and dehydrogenase in soil covered with organic mulch were 17.46%, 78.98%, and 283.19% higher than those under lawn, respectively. The marker genes of fermentation, aerobic respiration, methanogenesis, and methane oxidation were also enriched in the soil under organic mulch. Nitrogen cycling was generally repressed by the organic mulch, but the assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction processes were enhanced. The activity of alkaline phosphatase was 12.63% higher in the mulch-covered soil, and functional genes involved in phosphorus cycling were also enriched. This study presents a comprehensive investigation of the influence of organic mulch on soil microbes and provides a deeper insight into the recovery strategy for soil degradation following urban greening.

TI  - Evaluation of developing maize microbiomes and associations among nitrogen cyclers and key fungal taxa
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY-SGM
AB  - More sustainable approaches to agriculture are urgently needed to protect existing resources and optimize crop yields and to provide food for a growing global human population. More sustainable agricultural practices that utilize plant-microbe relationships across cultivation are urgently needed. The main objectives of this study were to track the prokaryotic and fungal microbiomes associated with key growth stages of developing maize to evaluate the relationships among nitrogen cycling bacteria and major fungal genera including those known to contain arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and other important taxa. Prokaryotic and fungal microbiomes associated with bulk soils, rhizosphere soils and tissues of developing maize were characterized using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Similarities in microbiome diversity and abundance were compared to sample metadata to explore the influence of external factors on microbiome development. Correlations among target fungal taxa, bulk bacteria and nitrogen cycling bacteria were determined using non-parametric Spearman correlations. Important maize-associated fungal taxa were detected in all samples across growth stages, with Fusarium, Penicillium and Aspergillus fungi comprising up to 4.21, 4.26 and 0.28% of all fungal genera, respectively. Thirteen statistically significant correlations between nitrogen cycling genera and targeted fungal genera were also identified (r(s)>= 0.70 or r(s)<=-0.70; P<0.05). This study is the first to note a strong positive association among several nitrifying bacteria and Fusarium (R=0.71; P=0.0046), Aspergillus (R=0.71; P=0.0055) and Cladosporium spcies (R=0.74; P=0.0038), suggesting the levels of soil nitrate, nitrite or nitrification intermediates may have large roles in the proliferation of important maize-associated fungi.

TI  - Effects of fire intensity on soil microbial diversity and nitrogen cycling functional genes in forests (Northeast China)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction Forest fire disturbance is one of the most critical factors affecting forest ecosystems in Northeast China. It disrupts ecosystem balance, alters soil physical and chemical properties, and significantly impacts soil microbial communities and nitrogen cycling. Understanding these changes is essential for post-fire vegetation restoration and nitrogen pool reconstruction.Methods This study focused on a burned Larix gmelinii forest in the Daxing'an Mountains. We investigated soil environmental factors, microbial community structure, nitrogen cycle genes, and their interrelationships under different fire intensity conditions.Results (1) Light fire increased soil pH, total nitrogen (TN), soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), and available phosphorus (AP), but reduced soil moisture content (SMC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N). Severe fire raised bulk density (BD), available potassium (AK), AP, and NO3--N, while decreasing SMC, MBC, MBN, NH4+-N, and TN. (2) Bacterial diversity (Shannon index) increased after light fire but decreased after severe fire; richness indices (Sobs and Chao1) declined under both fire conditions. Fungal diversity and richness declined with both light and severe fires. Dominant soil bacterial phylum was Proteobacteria (with Bradyrhizobium as dominant genus), while dominant fungal phylum was Basidiomycota (with Russula as dominant genus). (3) Abundance of nitrogen fixation gene nifH declined with increasing fire intensity. Abundance of nitrification genes amoA-AOA and amoA-AOB significantly increased. Denitrification genes (nirK, nirS, nosZ) increased after light fire but decreased after severe fire. (4) Soil nitrogen (MBN, TN, NH4+-N, NO3--N) had a direct positive effect on nitrogen cycle genes, while fire intensity, available nutrients (AP, AK), and bacterial communities had direct negative effects.Discussion The findings reveal the complex response of soil properties, microbial communities and nitrogen cycle genes to different fire intensities. These findings provide a scientific basis for effective post-fire ecosystem management and soil fertility restoration in the boreal forest.

TI  - Effects of decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) exposure on soil microbial community: Nitrogen cycle, microbial defense and repair and antibiotic resistance genes transfer
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - DBDPE, a widely used brominated flame retardant, is frequently detected in soil. However, the toxic effects of DBDPE on soil microbial communities remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of DBDPE on the microbial community shifts, the nitrogen cycle, microbial defense and repair, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) transfer. After 28 days of DBDPE exposure, the soil microbial community was altered. Denitrifier were enriched by 4.07-78.22% under DBDPE exposure concentrations of 100-1000 ng/g. Additionally, the abundances of genes encoding enzymes involved in nitrification and denitrification processes were up-regulated at 100 ng/g DBDPE exposure, and further promoted at 1000 ng/g DBDPE exposure. Meanwhile, DBDPE exposure at concentrations of 100-1000 ng/g stimulated the production of extracellular polymers substances (EPS) (2155-2347 mg/kg), increased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (by 97.95-108.38%), and activated the antioxidant defense system of soil microorganisms, which correspondingly down-regulated catalase (CAT) genes (by 4.65-4.91%), while up-regulated superoxide dismutase (SOD) (by 0.52-2.63%) and glutathione (GSH) genes (by 19.03%-44.61%). Genes related to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis were up-regulated, enhancing cell membrane repair in response to DBDPE exposure. Moreover, the increase in DBDPE concentration selectively enriched and promoted the transmission of ARGs. The co-occurrence network of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) revealed that DBDPE facilitated the horizontal gene transfer (HGT)-mediated transmission of transposase, ist, and insertion sequence-associated ARGs.

TI  - Functional diversity and abundance of nitrogen cycle-related genes in paddy soil
T2  - APPLIED BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The nitrogen cycle and the associated microbes play an important role in natural ecosystems, including terrestrial habitats; they also have a major effect on climate change. The aim of this study was to explore microbial communities in rice paddy soil by detecting and quantifying some key functional genes involved in the nitrogen cycle using molecular techniques such as conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), clone library construction, sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and real-time PCR. The genes analyzed were as follows: nitrogenase reductase gene (nifH), hydrazine synthase gene (hzsA), nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ), copper-containing (nirK) and cytochrome cd1-containing (nirS) nitrite reductase genes, nitrite oxidoreductase gene (nxrB), and ammonium monooxygenase gene (amoA). The sequence assessment using the clone library targeting these genes revealed high diversity and dominance of bacterial communities. Furthermore, real-time PCR using SYBR green dye and some primers specific for each gene revealed the high abundance of nxrB (4.1 x 10(9) +/- 0.4 x 10(9) copies g(-1) soil) and low abundance of hzsA (4.0 x 10(5) +/- 1.1 x 10(5) copies g(-1) soil). The findings of our study will be useful to explore microbial communities in terrestrial habitats, such as agricultural paddy fields.

TI  - Soil metagenomics reveals the effect of nitrogen on soil microbial communities and nitrogen-cycle functional genes in the rhizosphere of Panax ginseng
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is the primary essential nutrient for ginseng growth, and a reasonable nitrogen application strategy is vital for maintaining the stability of soil microbial functional communities. However, how microbial-mediated functional genes involved in nitrogen cycling in the ginseng rhizosphere respond to nitrogen addition is largely unknown. In this study, metagenomic technology was used to study the effects of different nitrogen additions (N0: 0, N1: 20, N2: 40 N g/m(2)) on the microbial community and functional nitrogen cycling genes in the rhizosphere soil of ginseng, and soil properties related to the observed changes were evaluated. The results showed that N1 significantly increased the soil nutrient content compared to N0, and the N1 ginseng yield was the highest (29.90% and 38.05% higher than of N0 and N2, respectively). N2 significantly decreased the soil NO3 -N content (17.18 mg/kg lower than N0) and pH. This resulted in a decrease in the diversity of soil microorganisms, a decrease in beneficial bacteria, an increase in the number of pathogenic microorganisms, and an significant increase in the total abundance of denitrification, assimilatory nitrogen reduction, and dissimilatory nitrogen reduction genes, as well as the abundance of nxrA and napA genes (17.70% and 65.25% higher than N0, respectively), which are functional genes involved in nitrification that promote the soil nitrogen cycling process, and reduce the yield of ginseng. The results of the correlation analysis showed that pH was correlated with changes in the soil microbial community, and the contents of soil total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4 +-N), and alkaline-hydrolyzed nitrogen (AHN) were the main driving factors affecting the changes in nitrogen cycling functional genes in the rhizosphere soil of ginseng. In summary, nitrogen addition affects ginseng yield through changes in soil chemistry, nitrogen cycling processes, and functional microorganisms.

TI  - Various players in the nitrogen cycle: Diversity and functions of the microorganisms involved in nitrification and denitrification
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Microorganisms play important roles in the nitrogen cycles of various ecosystems. Research has revealed that a greater diversity of microorganisms is involved in the nitrogen cycle than previously understood. It is becoming clear that denitrifying fungi, nitrifying archaea, anammox bacteria, aerobic denitrifying bacteria and heterotrophic nitrifying microorganisms are key players in the nitrogen cycle. Studies have revealed a major contribution by fungi in the production of N2O and N-2 in grasslands, semiarid regions and forest soils. Some fungi can grow under various O-2 conditions by using three types of energy-yielding metabolism: O-2 respiration, denitrification (nitrite respiration) and ammonia fermentation. The amoA-like gene copies of Crenarchaeota were shown to be more abundant in soils than in autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and the gene was expressed at higher levels in soil to which ammonia was added. There are some contradictory findings, however, regarding archaeal and bacterial nitrification. Anammox bacteria have been shown to be widely distributed and to play an important role in both artificial and natural environments. The contribution of heterotrophic microorganisms to nitrification has been recognized in soil, and the biochemical mechanisms of several bacteria are becoming clear. A wide variety of bacteria have been found to be able to carry out aerobic denitrification and to be distributed across diverse environments. Using molecular biological techniques for soil bacteria, Nitrosospira species of clusters 2, 3 and 4 have been shown to be the dominant group in soils. Genome analyses of autotrophic nitrifying bacteria are providing new insights into their ecology and functions in soils.

TI  - Invasive earthworms alter forest soil microbiomes and nitrogen cycling
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Northern hardwood forests in formerly glaciated areas had been free of earthworms until exotic European earthworms were introduced by human activities. The invasion of exotic earthworms is known to dramatically alter soil physical, geochemical, and biological properties, but its impacts on soil microbiomes are still unclear. Here we show that the invasive earthworms alter soil microbiomes and ecosystem functioning, especially for nitrogen cycling. We collected soil samples at different depths from three sites across an active earthworm invasion chronosequence in a hardwood forest in Minnesota, USA. We analyzed the structures and the functional potentials of the soil microbiomes by using amplicon sequencing, high-throughput nitrogen cycle gene quantification (NiCE chip), and shotgun metagenomics. Both the levels of earthworm invasion and soil depth influenced the microbiome structures and the functional gene abundances. In the most recently and minimally invaded soils, Nitrososphaera and Nitrospira as well as the genes related to nitrification were more abundant than in the heavily invaded soils. By contrast, genes related to denitrification and nitrogen fixation were more abundant in the heavily invaded than the minimally invaded soils at various depths. Since denitrification can cause a nitrogen loss from the ecosystem, our results suggest the invasion of earthworms could influence the overall forest N cycling.

TI  - Antibiotics and temperature interact to disrupt soil communities and nutrient cycling
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soils contain immense diversity and support terrestrial ecosystem functions, but they face both anthropogenic and environmental stressors. While many studies have examined the influence of individual stressors on soils, how these perturbations will interact to shape soil communities and their ability to cycle nutrients is far less resolved. Here, we hypothesized that when soils experience multiple stressors their ability to maintain connected and stable communities is disrupted, leading to shifts in C and N pools. To test this, we maintained soils across three temperatures representative of seasonal variability (15, 20 and 30 degrees C) and introduced high or low doses of the common livestock antibiotic Monensin. We monitored respiration and examined changes to microbial communities through amplicon sequencing and network analyses. We also examined soil C and N pools to understand how temperature and antibiotics shape ecosystem function. We found that antibiotics and rising soil temperatures interacted to disrupt bacterial assemblages and network structure, allowing for a rise in fungal dominance and change in soil nutrient stoichiometry. Antibiotics alone decreased bacterial diversity, abundance, total extractable N, and microbial carbon use efficiency, while increasing bioavailable C. Higher temperatures independently homogenized fungal community composition, decreased dissolved organic C and increased soil respiration rates. These results emphasize that as soils encounter multiple stressors, ecosystem efficiency, stability and resilience may be diminished.

TI  - Impacts of Land Use on Soil Nitrogen-Cycling Microbial Communities: Insights from Community Structure, Functional Gene Abundance, and Network Complexity
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - This study investigates the effects of different land-use types (forest, arable land, and wetland) on key soil properties, microbial communities, and nitrogen cycling in the Lesser Khingan Mountains. The results revealed that forest (FL) and wetland (WL) soils had significantly higher soil organic matter (SOM) content compared with arable land (AL), with total phosphorus (TP) being highest in FL and available nitrogen (AN) significantly higher in WL. In terms of enzyme activity, AL and WL showed reduced activities of ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), beta-D-glucosidase (beta-G), and beta-cellobiosidase (CBH), while exhibiting increased N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity, highlighting the impact of land use on nitrogen dynamics. WL also exhibited significantly higher microbial diversity and evenness compared with FL and AL. The dominant bacterial phyla included Actinobacteriota, Proteobacteria, and Acidobacteriota, with Acidobacteriota being most abundant in FL and Proteobacteria most abundant in WL. Network analysis showed that AL had the most complex and connected microbial network, while FL and WL had simpler but more stable networks, suggesting the influence of land use on microbial community interactions. Regarding nitrogen cycling genes, AOA-amoA was most abundant in AL, while AOB-amoA was significantly enriched in FL, reflecting the influence of land use on ammonia oxidation. These findings highlight how land-use types significantly affect soil properties, microbial community structures, and nitrogen cycling, offering valuable insights for sustainable land management.

TI  - Wetlands harbor lactic acid-driven chain elongators
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Wetlands are globally significant carbon storage hotspots. Recent research has suggested that microbially derived metabolites may contribute to soil organic matter formation. Identifying pathways driving the formation of such metabolites is critical to understand the global impact of wetland carbon cycling. Here, we evaluate the presence of chain-elongating organisms converting two to three carbon compounds (i.e., lactic and acetic acid) to medium-chain carboxylic acids (MCCA; i.e., six-carbon caproic acid) in wetland soils. We demonstrate the enrichment of a lactic acid-driven chain-elongating community from wetland soils producing a mixture of butyric and caproic acid. The enriched community was dominated by Clostridiaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, three families with known chain elongators. Amplicon sequencing identified three Ruminococcaceae and one Clostridiaceae zero-radius OTU (zOTU) that were (i) present in the soil, (ii) enriched over 1% relative abundance in the bioreactor, and (iii) were closely related to known chain elongators. Moreover, close relatives of the three Ruminococcaceae zOTU were also observed in several other wetland microbiomes. From this observation, we conclude that close relatives of known chain elongators, potentially capable of lactic acid-driven MCCA production themselves, are present in wetland soils. This observation may have implications for our understanding of carbon cycling and storage in wetland ecosystems.IMPORTANCEWetlands are globally significant carbon cycling hotspots that both sequester large amounts of CO2 as soil carbon as well as emit a third of all CH4 globally. Their outsized role in the global carbon cycle makes it critical to understand microbial processes contributing to carbon breakdown and storage in these ecosystems. Here, we confirm the presence of chain-elongating organisms in freshwater wetland soils. These organisms take small carbon compounds formed during the breakdown of biomass and turn them into larger compounds (six to eight carbon organic acids) that may potentially contribute to the formation of soil organic matter and long-term carbon storage. Moreover, we find that these chain-elongating organisms may be widely distributed in wetlands globally. Future work should identify these organisms' contribution to carbon cycling in wetlands and the potential role of the products they form in carbon sequestration in wetlands.

TI  - New insights into the effects of chlorpyrifos on soil microbes: Carbon and nitrogen cycle related microbes in wheat/maize rotation agricultural field*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Chlorpyrifos, a broad-spectrum organophosphorus insecticide, has been widely detected worldwide and is a potential neurotoxin and endocrine disruptor. Besides, chlorpyrifos has been proven that have a negative effect on soil microbes. In the present study, chlorpyrifos formulation (LORSBAN (R), 45% emulsifiable concentrate) was applied in an agricultural field at the recommended dose (R dose, 270.0 and 337.5 g a.i. ha-1 for wheat and maize respectively) and double recommended (DR) dose. Chlorpyrifos residue level and effect on soil microbes related to soil carbon and nitrogen cycle function were analyzed. Results showed that the half-lives of chlorpyrifos in wheat and maize field soil were 7.23-8.23 and 1.45-1.77 d, respectively. Application of chlorpyrifos at even DR dose did not result in unacceptable residual chlorpyrifos, where the final residual chlorpyrifos in wheat/ maize (leaf, stem, and grain) was meet the requirement of the maximum residual limit (0.5 mg kg-1 for wheat and 0.05 mg kg- 1 for maize) in China. Chlorpyrifos enhanced the activity of beta- glucosidase by increasing the relative abundance of Sphingosinicella and promoted the carbon cycle in wheat field. The changes of cbbLR and cbbLG gene abundance also confirmed that chlorpyrifos could affect the import and export of soil carbon pool. The effect of chlorpyrifos on soil N cycle was determined by changes in the abundance of the bacterial genus Gemmatimonas, which is associated with denitrification. Further analysis of N-cycle functional genes and urease activity showed that chlorpyrifos inhibited nitrogen fixation in wheat field, but promoted nitrogen fixation in maize field. In general, bacterial abundance, urease, and AOA-amoA gene could be early warning markers of chlorpyrifos contamination. The results demonstrated the negative effects of chlorpyrifos on soil microbes especially on soil C and N cycle in actual agricultural field. It provides new insights about chlorpyrifos environmental pollution and its effect on soil ecosystems.

TI  - High level of winter warming aggravates soil carbon, nitrogen loss and changes greenhouse gas emission characteristics in seasonal freeze-thaw farmland soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Changes in the soil environment caused by winter warming is affecting the carbon and nitrogen cycles of seasonal freeze-thaw farmland soil. A field experiment was conducted in a seasonal freeze-thaw farmland soil of northeast China to investigate the effects caused from different levels of warming (W1 + 1.77(degrees)C, W2 + 0.69(degrees)C and C + 0(degrees)C) on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, microbial biomass and greenhouse gases fluxes. During the early and middle winter, the contents of all kinds of soil carbon and nitrogen (Ammonium, nitrate, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, readily oxidizable organic carbon and soil organic carbon) tended to increase with the increase of warming level, while during the late winter, their contents under different temperature treatments roughly present trend of W2 >= C > W1. Except for the late thawing period, warming increased the contents of soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, during the late thawing period, with the increase of warming level, MBC and MBN decreased significantly. Warming would stimulate the release of greenhouse gases from soil. But due to the differences of soil environmental conditions in each period and soil nutrient dynamics under different treatments, which made the effects of different levels of warming on soil GHGs fluxes in different periods are different. Our study suggested that low-level warming improved the availability of soil carbon and nitrogen, increased the contents of microbial biomass and greenhouse gas emissions. However, although high-level winter warming showed a similar phenomenon in the early and middle winter to the low-level warming, during the late winter, high-level warming increased soil nutrients loss and broke the seasonal coupling relationship between crop nutrient acquisition and soil microbial nutrient supply, and even led to the adaptation of soil CO2 release to it. This is of great significance for exploring the carbon and nitrogen cycle mechanisms of global terrestrial ecosystem.

TI  - Temporal changes of microbial community structure and nitrogen cycling processes during the aerobic degradation of phenanthrene
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Phenanthrene (PHE) is frequently detected in worldwide soils. But it is still not clear that how the microbial community succession happens and the nitrogen-cycling processes alter during PHE degradation. In this study, the temporal changes of soil microbial community composition and nitrogen-cycling processes during the biodegradation of PHE (12 mu g g(-1)) were explored. The results showed that the biodegradation of PHE followed the second-order kinetics with a half-life of 7 days. QPCR results demonstrated that the bacteria numbers increased by 67.1%-194.7% with PHE degradation, whereas, no significant change was observed in fungi numbers. Thus, high-throughput sequencing based on 16 S rRNA was conducted and showed that the abundances of Methylotenera, Comamonadaceae, and Nocardioides involved in PHE degradation and denitrification were significantly increased, while those of nitrogen-metabolism-related genera such as Nitrososphaeraceae, Nitrospira, Gemmatimonadacea were decreased in PHE-treated soil. Co-occurrence network analysis suggested that more complex interrelations were constructed, and Proteobacteria instead of Acidobacteriota formed intimate associations with other microbes in responding to PHE exposure. Additionally, the abundances of nifH and narG were significantly up-regulated in PHE-treated soil, while that of amoA especially AOAamoA was down-regulated. Finally, correlation analysis found several potential microbes (Methylotenera, Comamonadaceae, and Agromyces) that could couple PHE degradation and nitrogen transformation. This study confirmed that PHE could alter microbial community structure, change the native bacterial network, and disturb nitrogen-cycling processes.

TI  - The Pyrogenic Carbon Cycle
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCES, VOL 43
AB  - Pyrogenic carbon (PyC; includes soot, char, black carbon, and biochar) is produced by the incomplete combustion of organic matter accompanying biomass burning and fossil fuel consumption. PyC is pervasive in the environment, distributed throughout the atmosphere as well as soils, sediments, and water in both the marine and terrestrial environment. The physicochemical characteristics of PyC are complex and highly variable, dependent on the organic precursor and the conditions of formation. A component of PyC is highly recalcitrant and persists in the environment for millennia. However, it is now clear that a significant proportion of PyC undergoes transformation, translocation, and remineralization by a range of biotic and abiotic processes on comparatively short timescales. Here we synthesize current knowledge of the production, stocks, and fluxes of PyC as well as the physical and chemical processes through which it interacts as a dynamic component of the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Cassava-Maize Rotation Improves Soil Quality and Microbial Gene Profiles Compared to Continuous Cassava Cropping
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Due to limited land resources and traditional farming practices, continuous cassava cropping is common in China. This practice leads to soil degradation, including reduced fertility, imbalanced microbial communities, and lower crop yields. In this study, we investigated the impacts of continuous cassava cropping (CC) and cassava-maize rotation (RC) systems on soil physicochemical properties, microbial community composition, and functional gene abundance related to carbon and nitrogen cycling. The RC system consists of a five-year rotation cycle: cassava is planted in the first year, followed by two consecutive years of maize, and then, cassava is planted again in the last two years. The soil type is classified as Haplic Acrisols with a clay loam texture in this research. Soil samples from both cropping systems were analyzed for physicochemical properties and enzyme activities, and the results showed significant decreases in soil pH, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium in CC. Using metagenomic sequencing, 1,280,928 and 1,224,958 unigenes were identified under RC and CC, respectively, with differences in microbial taxonomic and functional profiles. Bacteria accounted for 89.257% of the soil community in RC, whereas the proportion was 88.72% in CC. The proportions of eukaryota and viruses in RC were 0.031% and 0.006%, respectively; in contrast, their proportions were 0.04% and 0.02% in CC, respectively. Cassava-maize rotation promoted the metabolic activities of soil microbes, leading to a significant enhancement in functional genes related to nitrogen and carbon cycling, such as nasA, nasD, nrtC, coxA, porA, and frdA. This shows that microbial activity and nutrient cycling improved in the crop rotation system. Thus, these findings highlight the importance of crop rotation for maintaining soil health, enhancing microbial functions, and improving sustainable cassava production. This study provides valuable insights into the management of cassava agroecosystems and the mitigation of the adverse effects of continuous cropping.

TI  - Dicamba herbicide alters microbial community, metabolite composition, and nitrogen-cycling function in the wheat rhizosphere
T2  - RHIZOSPHERE
AB  - Rhizosphere microorganisms are crucial for the growth and health of their host plants. Dicamba is one of the representative herbicides used for the control of wheat weeds. In recent years, the usage of dicamba has escalated globally, particularly with the advent of dicamba-tolerant transgenic crops. However, the impacts of this herbicide on non-target organisms, particularly the rhizosphere microorganisms of wheat, is not yet clear. Furthermore, rhizosphere microorganisms are important for nitrogen cycling in soil-crop systems, the influence of dicamba on rhizosphere nitrogen cycling functionality needs further investigation. This study aims to elucidate the effects of dicamba on the microbial community, metabolite profiles, and nitrogen cycling-related genes in wheat rhizosphere. Our findings indicated that dicamba led to significant alterations in the diversity and cooccurrence patterns of the rhizosphere microbial community, notably reducing the abundances of phyla Verrucomicrobia, Planctomycetes, and Cyanobacteria. Additionally, dicamba markedly disturbed the rhizosphere metabolite profiles, particularly those associated with carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Notably, dicamba treatment resulted in an up-regulation of enzymatic genes catalyzing processes of assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (ANRA)/dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) (EC: 1.7.5.1, EC: 1.9.6.1, and EC: 1.7.1.15) and denitrification (EC: 1.7.2.1 and EC: 1.7.2.5). The observed increases in the abundances of the genera Cellulosimicrobium and Pseudomethylobacillus were critical for facilitating ANRA and DNRA. The application of dicamba altered soil organic matter content, which in turn influenced the abundances of microorganisms involved in ANRA/DNRA and denitrification, thereby affecting the nitrogen cycling functionality in the rhizosphere. This study offers valuable theoretical support for assessing the rhizosphere ecological effects of agrochemical application.

TI  - Warming effects on greenhouse gas fluxes in peatlands are modulated by vegetation composition
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Abstract
   Understanding the effects of warming on greenhouse gas feedbacks to climate change represents a major global challenge. Most research has focused on direct effects of warming, without considering how concurrent changes in plant communities may alter such effects. Here, we combined vegetation manipulations with warming to investigate their interactive effects on greenhouse gas emissions from peatland. We found that although warming consistently increased respiration, the effect on net ecosystem CO2 exchange depended on vegetation composition. The greatest increase in CO2 sink strength after warming was when shrubs were present, and the greatest decrease when graminoids were present. CH4 was more strongly controlled by vegetation composition than by warming, with largest emissions from graminoid communities. Our results show that plant community composition is a significant modulator of greenhouse gas emissions and their response to warming, and suggest that vegetation change could alter peatland carbon sink strength under future climate change.

TI  - Microbes drive global soil nitrogen mineralization and availability
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil net nitrogen mineralization rate (N-min), which is critical for soil nitrogen availability and plant growth, is thought to be primarily controlled by climate and soil physical and/or chemical properties. However, the role of microbes on regulating soil N-min has not been evaluated on the global scale. By compiling 1565 observational data points of potential net N-min from 198 published studies across terrestrial ecosystems, we found that N-min significantly increased with soil microbial biomass, total nitrogen, and mean annual precipitation, but decreased with soil pH. The variation of N-min was ascribed predominantly to soil microbial biomass on global and biome scales. Mean annual precipitation, soil pH, and total soil nitrogen significantly influenced N-min through soil microbes. The structural equation models (SEM) showed that soil substrates were the main factors controlling N-min when microbial biomass was excluded. Microbe became the primary driver when it was included in SEM analysis. SEM with soil microbial biomass improved the N-min prediction by 19% in comparison with that devoid of soil microbial biomass. The changes in N-min contributed the most to global soil NH4+-N variations in contrast to climate and soil properties. This study reveals the complex interactions of climate, soil properties, and microbes on N-min and highlights the importance of soil microbial biomass in determining N-min and nitrogen availability across the globe. The findings necessitate accurate representation of microbes in Earth system models to better predict nitrogen cycle under global change.

TI  - Effect of planting salt-tolerant legumes on coastal saline soil nutrient availability and microbial communities
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Soil salinization is a serious global environmental problem affecting sustainable development of agriculture. Legumes are excellent candidates for the phytoremediation of saline soils; however, how soil microbes mediate the amelioration of coastal saline ecosystems is unknown. In this study, two salt-tolerant legumes, Glycine soja and Sesbania cannabina were planted in coastal saline soil for three years. Soil nutrient availability and microbiota structure (including bacteria, fungi, and diazotrophs) were compared between the phytoremediated soils and control soil (barren land). Planting legumes reduced soil salinity, and increased total carbon, total nitrogen, and NO3  -N contents. Among the soil microbiota, some nitrogen-fixing bacteria (e.g., Azotobacter) were enriched in legumes, which were probably responsible for soil nitrogen accumulation. The complexity of the bacterial, fungal, and diazotrophic networks increased significantly from the control to the phytoremediated soils, suggesting that the soil microbial community formed closer ecological interactions during remediation. Furthermore, the dominant microbial functions were chemoheterotrophy (24.75%) and aerobic chemoheterotrophy (21.97%) involved in the carbon cycle, followed by nitrification (13.68%) and aerobic ammonia oxidation (13.34%) involved in the nitrogen cycle. Overall, our findings suggested that G. soja and S. cannabina legumes were suitable for ameliorating saline soils as they decreased soil salinity and increased soil nutrient content, with microorganisms especially nitrogen-fixing bacteria, playing an important role in this remediation process.

Understanding the processes that structure this community is critical to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. In North American forests, soil fungal communities are regulated by grazing soil invertebrates, which are in turn controlled by the predatory red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus). The presence of these soil invertebrate taxa is known to exert direct top-down control via selective grazing on saprotrophic fungi, with direct consequences for biogeochemical cycling in soil. We investigated whether the removal of P. cinereus would relieve top-down control on decomposer fungal communities in a tri-trophic mesocosm study. Fungal communities were characterized using metabarcoding and high-throughput DNA sequencing. The beta-diversity of fungal communities differed between salamander presence and absence treatments with a strong effect on saprotrophic fungal communities. We concluded that P. cinereus, a mesopredator in the detritivore food chain, exerts a prominent control on the composition and functional diversity of fungal communities in soil through a multi-trophic top-down process. Given their capacity to govern the compositions of soil invertebrates, the activity of these amphibians may be important for regulating ecosystem function and nutrient cycling in temperate forest systems.

TI  - Phosphorus cycling in deciduous forest soil differs between stands dominated by ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal trees
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Although much is known about how trees and their associated microbes influence nitrogen cycling in temperate forest soils, less is known about biotic controls over phosphorus (P) cycling. Given that mycorrhizal fungi are instrumental for P acquisition and that the two dominant associations - arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi - possess different strategies for acquiring P, we hypothesized that P cycling would differ in stands dominated by trees associated with AM vs ECM fungi.
   We quantified soil solution P, microbial biomass P, and sequentially extracted inorganic and organic P pools from May to November in plots dominated by trees forming either AM or ECM associations in south-central Indiana, USA.
   Overall, fungal communities in AM and ECM plots were functionally different and soils exhibited fundamental differences in P cycling. Organic forms of P were more available in ECM plots than in AM plots. Yet inorganic P decreased and organic P accumulated over the growing season in both ECM and AM plots, resulting in increasingly P-limited microbial biomass.
   Collectively, our results suggest that P cycling in hardwood forests is strongly influenced by biotic processes in soil and that these are driven by plant-associated fungal communities.

TI  - Rotational pasture management to increase the sustainability of mountain livestock farms in the Alpine region
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Over the past 30 years, farming in the Alpine region has undergone important changes: the average number of animals per farm and the use of external inputs have increased while the diversity of farming practices has decreased, becoming similar to intensive farming. This change has led to a reduction in the supply of agroecosystem services and the sustainability of the mountain livestock sector. In this study, we investigated rotational grazing as alternative to continuous grazing to improve the sustainability of mountain farming practices. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide were measured together with soil properties (bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, organic carbon content and plant biomass) for two grazing seasons using static chambers. The results showed that rotational grazing had a positive impact on plant biomass: minimize soil disturbance, reduce compaction and GHG emissions of the soil and increase water infiltration. Therefore, this practice has revealed clear benefits in terms of soil protection and climate change mitigation and adaptation.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - The severe consequences of human disruptions to the global carbon cycle have prompted intense interest in strategies to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Because growing forests capture CO2 in their biomass and soils, large-scale tree planting efforts have been advertised as a viable way to counteract anthropogenic emissions as part of net-zero emission strategies. Here, we assess the potential impact of reforestation and afforestation on the global climate system, and identify ecological, economic, and societal implications of such efforts.

TI  - Rethinking Invasion Impacts across Multiple Field Sites Using European Swallowwort (Vincetoxicum rossicum) as a Model Invader
T2  - INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - European swallowwort [Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleopow) Barbarich] is found in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It forms dense growth patterns that reduce plant and insect biodiversity, and lab assays show that it produces allelopathic compounds that affect microbial activity. Consequently, we hypothesized that V. rossicum alters soil microbiome composition and activity in invaded habitats, which may impact ecosystem properties and processes. We sampled soil from a similar time point within a growing season at each of five sites in New York State where V. rossicum was both present and absent. We measured bacterial and fungal microbiome composition, available soil nitrogen (N), soil respiration (CO2 flux), and soil extracellular enzyme activities. Microbial composition varied across field sites, but only fungal composition was affected by invasion. No significant differences were found between the invaded and uninvaded plots at any of the sites for available soil ammonium, nitrate, or respiration, though extractable N varied greatly between sites. Microbial hydrolytic extracellular enzyme activities suggest decreased protein degradation and increased oxidative enzyme activity with V. rossicum invasion, which is relevant to soil N and carbon cycling processes. Although V. rossicum impacted rhizosphere microbial composition and activity, it was not associated with large perturbations in ecosystem function when examined across multiple invasion sites during this short-term study.

TI  - Elevated CO2 increases nitrogen fixation and decreases soil nitrogen mineralization in Florida scrub oak
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - We report changes in nitrogen cycling in Florida scrub oak in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 during the first 14 months of experimental treatment. Elevated CO2 stimulated above-ground growth, nitrogen mass, and root nodule production of the nitrogen-fixing vine, Galactia elliottii Nuttall. During this period, elevated CO2 reduced rates of gross nitrogen mineralization in soil, and resulted in lower recovery of nitrate on resin lysimeters. Elevated CO2 did not alter nitrogen in the soil microbial biomass, but increased the specific rate of ammonium immobilization (NH4+ immobilized per unit microbial N) measured over a 24-h period. Increased carbon input to soil through greater root growth combined with a decrease in the quality of that carbon in elevated CO2 best explains these changes.
   These results demonstrate that atmospheric CO2 concentration influences both the internal cycling of nitrogen (mineralization, immobilization, and nitrification) as well as the processes that regulate total ecosystem nitrogen mass (nitrogen fixation and nitrate leaching) in Florida coastal scrub oak. If these changes in nitrogen cycling are sustained, they could cause long-term feedbacks to the growth responses of plants to elevated CO2. Greater nitrogen fixation and reduced leaching could stimulate nitrogen-limited plant growth by increasing the mass of labile nitrogen in the ecosystem. By contrast, reduced nitrogen mineralization and increased immobilization will restrict the supply rate of plant-available nitrogen, potentially reducing plant growth. Thus, the net feedback to plant growth will depend on the balance of these effects through time.

TI  - Pyraclostrobin repeated treatment altered the degradation behavior in soil and negatively affected soil bacterial communities and functions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - This study investigated the degradation dynamics of the fungicide pyraclostrobin in three apple orchard soils, along with the responses of soil bacterial community compositions, functions, co-occurrence patterns, and soil nitrogen cycling, under repeated treatment strategies in laboratory conditions. The degradation half-lives of pyraclostrobin varied across the soil types, ranging from 15.7 to 43.4 days, in the following order: Anyang soil > Qingdao soil > Yangling soil. Repeated pyraclostrobin treatment affected degradation behaviors across the different soils. Pyraclostrobin significantly inhibited soil microbial activity and reduced soil bacterial diversity, with more pronounced negative effects observed at high-concentration treatment. Pyraclostrobin clearly changed soil bacterial community structures, significantly enriching potentially degradative bacterial genera such as Methylibium and Nocardioides, which showed increases in the relative abundances of 3.0-181.8 % compared with control. Additionally, pyraclostrobin reduced the complexity of soil bacterial networks and modified the diversity of functional modules. Notably, repeated treatment severely disrupted soil nitrogen cycling, with the absolute abundances of amoA, amoB, nifH, nirK, and nirS in high-concentration treatment decreasing by up to 19.4-91.8 % compared with control. Collectively, pyraclostrobin repeated application altered the degradation behavior, inhibited soil microbial activities, modified soil bacterial community structures and co-occurrence patterns, and seriously disrupted soil nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Impacts of Legacy and Contemporary Nitrogen Inputs on N2O and CO2 Emissions in Miscanthus and Maize Cultivated Soils
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY
AB  - Nutrient inputs influence the sustainability of bioenergy crop production through contemporary (shortly after addition) and legacy effects (persisting over years) on microbial nitrogen (N) and carbon cycling, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. However, the relative importance of contemporary and legacy effects and how that could vary by crop functional types is poorly understood. Considering its rhizomatous roots and perennial growth, we hypothesized that Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) would be more sensitive to legacy N fertilization and the historical context of its environment than an annual crop like maize. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of legacy and contemporary N inputs on nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, as well as key N cycling genes in soils where Mxg and maize were grown. A 150-day soil incubation experiment was conducted using soils from a long-term Mxg and maize fertility experiment with three historic N fertilization rates (0, 112, and 336 kg N ha-1 year-1) and a contemporary amendment (60 mg N kg-1) with negative control (0 mg N kg-1). We observed significant increases in cumulative N2O emissions in Mxg soils relative to maize soils, particularly at higher legacy fertilization rates, while contemporary N had no significant effect. Bacterial amoA gene abundance, which plays a significant role in nitrification in nutrient-rich soils, also increased with higher legacy fertilization rates in Mxg soils but was unaffected by the contemporary N. In maize soils, legacy and contemporary N did not significantly affect N2O emissions, but cumulative CO2 emissions and amoA gene abundance significantly increased. The abundances of norB genes were not significantly influenced by either legacy fertilization or contemporary N amendments in either soil. Our findings demonstrate the greater importance of fertilization history over contemporary N in mediating soil N2O emissions, particularly for perennial bioenergy crops.

TI  - Organic Materials Promote Soil Phosphorus Cycling: Metagenomic Analysis
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - The combined application of chemical fertilizers with organic materials contributes to higher contents of bioavailable phosphorus. However, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. A field experiment including four treatments, chemical fertilizer (CF), chemical fertilizer with biochar (CB), chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer (CO), and chemical fertilizer with biochar and organic fertilizer (CBO), was conducted to explore how the combination of fertilizer applications enhanced soil phosphorus bioavailability using metagenomic sequencing technology. The results showed that chemical fertilizers combined with organic materials (CB, CO, and CBO) significantly increased citrate-extractable phosphorus by 34.61-138.92% and hydrochloric acid-extractable phosphorus contents by 72.85-131.07% compared to CF. In addition, the combined applications altered the microbial community structure and increased the abundance of phoR, spoT, and ppnK genes, but decreased those of gcd, phoD, and ppk1 genes. A partial least squares path model indicated that the combined applications regulated the microbial community composition and gene abundance of phosphorus-cycling microorganisms by influencing soil physicochemical properties, thereby enhancing soil phosphorus cycling. Correlation analysis indicated that pH, total phosphorus, and available phosphorus were the key factors influencing microbial communities, while available nitrogen and total nitrogen primarily regulated phosphorus cycling gene abundance. In addition, the CO and CBO treatments significantly increased maize yield by 14.60% and 21.04%, respectively. Overall, CBO most effectively enhanced bioavailable phosphorus content and maize yield. This study provides a foundation for developing rational fertilization strategies and improving soil phosphorus use efficiency.

TI  - Soil microplastics: Impacts on greenhouse gasses emissions, carbon cycling, microbial diversity, and soil characteristics
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Microplastics are a significant environmental challenge, with growing concerns about their prevalence in soil ecosystems. It may affect the physicochemical characteristics of soil, cycling of nutrients, and a variety of microbial organisms. In addition, microplastics affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane. The mechanism through which microplastic affects soil microbial communities and GHG emissions is complex and poorly understood. Nevertheless, new research indicates that microplastic pollution can have considerable and long -lasting impacts on the health and functioning of soil, which may have implications for ecosystem services and human well-being. Further investigation is required to comprehend the scope and methods of microplastic contamination in soil and its effects on soil functioning and to create efficient mitigation techniques that minimize its effects. This review highlights the urgent need for action to address this emerging environmental threat and protect soil health and ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Soil C-N and microbial community were altered by polybutylene adipate terephthalate microplastics
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The risks posed by biodegradable plastics to the plant-soil system have been increasingly studied due to potentially hazardous effects on soil properties and nutrient cycling. In this study, we investigated the effects of Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) microplastics (PBAT-MPs) on soil carbon, nitrogen and microbial communities under different levels of contamination (0 % (control), 0.1 %, 0.2 %, 0.5 % and 1 %), in soils planted with soybean (Glycine max (Linn.) Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.). The results showed that PBAT-MPs significantly altered soil dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen contents, and that these effects varied by plant type and growth stage (p < 0.05). PBAT-MPs significantly increased soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen for both plants (p < 0.05), except for microbial biomass nitrogen at the soybean flowering stage. PBAT-MPs altered the beta-diversity and composition of bacterial and fungal communities, increasing the relative abundances of Proteobacteria but decreasing the relative abundances of Acidobacteriota for both plants. FAPROTAX analysis showed that PBAT-MPs had significant effects on functional bacterial groups related to the nitrogen and carbon cycle, that varied by plant type and growth stage. These results suggest that biodegradable microplastics may have plant-specific effects on soil microbial communities and microbial metabolism, and thereby influence soil carbon and nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Responses of soil respiration to phosphorus addition in global grasslands: A meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have increased phosphorus deposition and affected ecosystem carbon cycles. Although soil respiration (RS) is crucial in driving the global carbon cycle and regulating climate change, the general pattern of RS response to phosphorus addition remains unclear in global grassland ecosystems. By conducting a meta-analysis of 75 independent study sites from 41 studies worldwide, we explored the general patterns and associated drivers of RS to phosphorus addition in grassland ecosystems. Overall, results showed that different grassland ecosystem types have varied effects caused by phosphorus addition. Specifically, phosphorus addition significantly increased RS in overall global grasslands by 9.20%, by 12.78% in temperate grassland, and no significant effects on RS in other grassland ecosystems (alpine and tropical grasslands). The response of RS was significantly negatively correlated with total soil phosphorus and soil available phosphorus, indicating that phosphorus addition increased the availability of phosphorus in the soil and altered RS in grassland ecosystems. Moreover, different grassland ecosystem types influenced by climatic factors affected the respiratory processes of the grassland carbon cycle under phosphorus addition conditions. Meanwhile, different experimental variables had different effects on grassland RS. Specifically, phosphorus addition had a significant effect on RS in grassland ecosystems when the duration of fertilizer application was <5 years. Overall, our results suggest that future increases in global exogenous phosphorus loads will affect global carbon cycling, providing a framework for a better understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms of carbon cycling in grassland ecosystems under increased phosphorus inputs.

TI  - Changes in the abundance and community composition of different nitrogen cycling groups in response to fumigation with 1,3-dichloropropene
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The fumigant 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) is widely-used to control pathogenic bacteria, fungi, nematodes and insects in soil before a crop is planted. Although fumigants in general have been reported to have a 'fertilizer effect' in the soil by increasing nitrogen availability, little is known of how a specific fumigant such as 1,3-D affects available nitrogen. This study used real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing techniques to investigate the effects of 1,3-D on microorganisms involved in nitrogen cycling that were present in 2 soils: Jiangxi lateritic red soil and Beijing fluvo-aquic soil. The fumigant 1,3-D temporarily decreased the abundance of 11 functional genes involved in nitrogen-fixing, nitrification and denitrification in both soil types. Different nitrogen cycling groups recovered to the unfumigated level in various incubation phases. Microorganisms containing nifH, nxrB, napA and qnorB genes were most vulnerable to 1,3-D fumigation. However, a stronger and longer inhibition effect of 1,3-D on these 11 functional genes was observed in Jiangxi soil than in Beijing soil. At the same time, the abundance of nifH, AOBamoA, nirS, qnorB and cnorB genes was significantly increased 59 days after 1,3-D fumigation. Fumigation with 1,3-D significantly reduced the nitrogen-fixing bacteria Azospirillum and Paenibacillus; the nitrifiers Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira; and the denitrifiers Pseudomonas, Paracoccus and Sphingomonas. Conversely, fumigation with 1,3-D increased the nitrogen-fixing bacteria Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium; the nitrification bacteria Nitrosospira and Nitrolancea; and the denitrification bacteria Sphingobium, Alcanivorax, Bacillus, Streptomyces and Aeromonas. Fumigation with 1,3-D therefore caused significant shifts in the species composition and number of microbes directly involved in nitrogen cycling in the short-term. These results contribute toward a better understanding of the impact of 1,3-D fumigation on various types of soil nitrogen-cycling groups. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen fertilization on nitrogen cycling in experimental riparian wetlands
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - Studies on the relationship between plant nitrogen content and soil nitrogen reduction under elevated CO2 conditions and with different nitrogen additions in wetland ecosystems are lacking. This study was meant to assess the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations and inorganic nitrogen additions on soil and plant nitrogen cycling. A cultured riparian wetland, alligator weeds, and two duplicated open top chambers (OTCs) with ambient (380 mu mol/mol) and elevated (700 mu mol/mol) CO2 concentrations at low (4 mg/L) and high (6 mg/L) nitrogen fertilization levels were used. The total plant biomass increased by 30.77% and 31.37% at low and high nitrogen fertilization levels, respectively, under elevated CO2 conditions. Plant nitrogen content decreased by 6.54% and 8.86% at low and high nitrogen fertilization levels, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of soil nitrogen contents ranged from 0.81 to 0.96. Under elevated CO2 conditions, plants utilized the assimilated inorganic nitrogen (from the soil) for growth and other internal physiological transformations, which might explain the reduction in plant nitrogen content. A reduction in soil dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) under elevated CO2 conditions might have also caused the reduction in plant nitrogen content. Reduced plant and soil nitrogen contents are to be expected due to the potential exhaustive use of inorganic nitrogen by soil microorganisms even before it can be made available to the soil and plants. The results from this study provide important information to help policy makers make informed decisions on sustainable management of wetlands. Larger-scale field work is recommended in future research. (C) 2018 Hohai University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Different rotation years change the structure and diversity of microorganisms in the nitrogen cycle, affecting crop yield
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Crop rotation is a common farmland management measure, which can effectively improve soil permeability and soil fertility, reduce crop diseases and pests, and affect microbial activity and community structure to a certain extent. However, the effects of long-term crop rotation pattern on nitrogen cycle microorganisms and crop yield are still unclear. Using monocrop rice as a control (CK), this study looked at the effects of different rotation years of tobacco rice (rotation years 10-20 (T10), 20-40 (T20), and >40 years of rotation) on nitrogen cycling microorganisms, soil nitrogen content, and crop yield. The results showed that compared with CK, crop rotation mode improved soil fertility and increased soil nitrogen content. Among them, the ammonium nitrogen content of farmland under T20 treatment (increased by 32.27 % compared with CK), and the yields of tobacco and rice were the highest (increased by 43.12 % compared with CK; Compared with T10 and T40 treatment, the tobacco content was increased by 3.59 % and 1.82 %, respectively). In addition, crop rotation also changed the structure and diversity of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms. This study found that Proteobacteria contributed significantly to the increase of soil nitrogen content, and Geobacter, Nitrosospira, Frankia, and Burkholderia Cupriavidus were the key groups to increase soil nitrogen content and crop yield. Therefore, tobacco rice rotation increases soil fertility and crop yield, but the effect decreases after >40 years. This study provides a reference for ensuring soil nitrogen transformation and sustainable agricultural production. The research results laid a solid theoretical foundation for the efficient transformation and utilization of soil nitrogen and grain increase.

TI  - Metagenomics of the Effect of Long-Term Straw Return on the Phosphorus Cycle in Meadow Black Soil
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Returning crop straw to the soil is an effective measure to increase soil fertility and maintain crop yield in agroecosystems. In this study, we conducted a 34-year field experiment (1984-2017) to investigate the relationships among the impacts of straw return on soil nutrients, phosphorus (P) fractions, phosphorus transformation-related functional microbial communities, and key genes in black soil. The results of the soil chemical properties showed that straw return could slow the decline in soil pH and increase soil nutrients, i.e., soil organic carbon (SOC), available K (AK), and available P (AP) concentrations, with the straw addition (PKS) treatment resulting in the highest soil AP and AK contents. Compared with conventional fertilizer (NPK) and conventional fertilizer with straw (NPKS), straw return alone (S) significantly increased the soil AP and AK contents by 1.1-42.8 and 38.3-114.3 mg/kg (p < 0.05), respectively. The results of the phosphorus fraction experiment indicated that long-term straw return promoted labile and moderately stable phosphorus content by altering the composition and increasing the relative abundances of functional genes regulating soil P activation (ugpQ, ppk, phoD, and gcd). The compositional changes in the phosphorus-cycling-related functional genes of the soil were affected mostly by soil total P (TP), AK, and NO3--N, whereas pH, SOC, and available N (AN) were the main environmental factors influencing the phosphorus-cycling-related microbial community composition. These direct measurements provide insight into the soil phosphorus fractions, phosphorus-cycling-related functional genes, and microbial communities associated with straw returning, which enhances our understanding of the chemical and biogeochemical behavior of soil phosphorus upon straw incorporation.

TI  - Nitrogen dynamics of decomposing Scots pine needle litter depends on colonizing fungal species
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - In boreal ecosystems plant production is often limited by low availability of nitrogen. Nitrogen retention in below-ground organic pools plays an important role in restricting recirculation to plants and thereby hampers forest production. Saprotrophic fungi are commonly assigned to different decomposer strategies, but how these relate to nitrogen cycling remains to be understood. Decomposition of Scots pine needle litter was studied in axenic microcosms with the ligninolytic litter decomposing basidiomycete Gymnopus androsaceus or the stress tolerant ascomycete Chalara longipes. Changes in chemical composition were followed by C-13 CP/MAS NMR spectroscopy and nitrogen dynamics was assessed by the addition of a N-15 tracer. Decomposition by C. longipes resulted in nitrogen retention in non-hydrolysable organic matter, enriched in aromatic and alkylic compounds, whereas the ligninolytic G. androsaceus was able to access this pool, counteracting nitrogen retention. Our observations suggest that differences in decomposing strategies between fungal species play an important role in regulating nitrogen retention and release during litter decomposition, implying that fungal community composition may impact nitrogen cycling at the ecosystem level.

TI  - Biofertilizers improve cotton yield by regulating microbial communities and N cycling processes in cotton fields under irrigated water with different salinity levels
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - Context: Biofertilizers contain active microorganisms and plant growth-regulating compounds and contribute to the improvement of soil microbial communities and the promotion of crop yields. However, the impact of biofertilizers (containing Bacillus subtilis) on microbial communities, nitrogen cycling, and cotton yields under varying irrigation salinity remains unclear. Objective and methods: This research aimed to examine the impact of biofertilizer (F2) on soil microbial communities, nitrogen cycling processes, and seed cotton yields in cotton fields under fresh water (W1: 0.48 g L-1), brackish water (W2: 3 g L-1), and salt water (W3: 7 g L-1) irrigation, with conventional fertilizer (F1) treatments serving as controls. A two-year field experiment (2021-2022) was conducted in film-mulched drip-irrigated cotton fields. Results and conclusions: Biofertilizers applied in different irrigation waters enhanced microbial abundance and altered both microbial community composition and nitrogen cycling processes. Irrigation water type primarily determined microbial diversity, with reductions observed under brackish and salt conditions. Compared to the W1F1 treatment, the W1F2 treatment significantly increased the expression of ansB (33.82 %) and gdh-K00260 (67.63 %) (N degradation genes), nifK (68.21 %) and nifD (109.84 %) (nitrogen fixation genes), narJ (42.69 %) and narI (21.57 %) (denitrification genes). Similarly, the W2F2 treatment showed elevated levels of ansB (33.93 %) and gdh-K00260 (87.19 %), as well as narJ (37.15 %) and narI (41.22 %), compared to W2F1. Additionally, W2F2 significantly increased nasA (35.09 %), a gene for assimilatory nitrate reduction. Meanwhile, the W1F2 and W2F2 treatments showed significantly higher N agronomic utilization efficiency and seed cotton yield. Notably, the W3F2 treatment showed a significant reduction in amoB-A (48.91 %) and amoA-A (46.55 %) (nitrification genes) compared to the W3F1 treatment. Soil salinity, microbial biomass (carbon and nitrogen), and enzyme activities (urease, invertase, protease, and cellulolytic enzymes) were the primary factors affecting the composition of microbial communities and functional genes of the nitrogen cycle. The partial least squares path analysis indicated that biofertilizers significantly increase cotton productivity by improving soil physicochemical properties and the efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer utilization. The primary factors influencing nitrogen utilization efficiency were identified as key nitrogen cycling functional genes and soil biological properties. Significance: This study offers insights into biofertilizer efficacy under saline water irrigation and provides usefulness for research on other types of biofertilizers.

TI  - Albedo estimated from remote sensing correlates with ecosystem multifunctionality in global drylands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Monitoring ecosystem functioning is a significant step towards detecting changes in ecosystem attributes that could be linked to land degradation and desertification in drylands worldwide. Remote sensing-based vegetation indices (VIs) and land surface albedo are two favorite indicators to monitor desertification process due to their close relationship with ecosystem status and to their increasing applicability over multiple spatiotemporal scales. While VIs are routinely used to monitor ecosystem attributes and functions such as vegetation cover and productivity, no previous study has evaluated whether remote sensing-measured albedo is related to the simultaneous provision of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality) in global drylands. In this study, we evaluated the correlation of six albedo metrics (shortwave black-sky albedo, shortwave white-sky albedo, visible black-sky albedo, visible white-sky albedo, near-infrared black-sky albedo and near-infrared white-sky albedo) and two VIs (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) with multifunctionality indices related to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling measured in 61 dryland ecosystems from all continents except Antarctica. We found a negative relationship between land surface albedo and multifunctionality. Black-sky albedo had a stronger correlation with multifunctionality than white-sky albedo. Visible black-sky albedo showed the strongest correlation with multifunctionality (MUL - 0.314), as well as with functions related to carbon (CCY - 0.216) and nitrogen cycling (NCY - 0.410), while near-infrared (0.339) and shortwave black-sky albedo (0.325) showed stronger correlations with functions related to phosphorus cycling (PCY) than visible black-sky albedo (0.233) did. VIs showed significant positive correlations with MUL, CCY, and NCY, and the magnitudes were higher than those observed between albedo metrics and the multifunctionality indices. However, VIs were not correlated with PCY, which had significant correlations with both shortwave and near-infrared albedo. Though the magnitudes of the correlations observed were not high, which may result from the wide variability in soil and vegetation types in our dataset, our findings indicate that remotely sensed albedo correlates to multifunctionality, which has been linked to alternative states in global drylands. As such, albedo has the potential to monitor changes in dryland ecosystem functioning, which can inform us about the onset of desertification in these areas.

TI  - Soil C-CO2 Emissions Across Different Land Uses in a Peri-Urban Area of Central Croatia
T2  - LAND
AB  - Soils play an important role in the global carbon cycle by storing organic carbon and releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) through biological processes. Land use management practices influence soil CO2 emissions by changing physical, chemical, and biological soil properties. Seasonal soil C-CO2 emissions (soil CO2 efflux expressed as C-CO2 in kg ha-1 day-1) were analyzed under cropland, orchard, grassland, forest, and abandoned land, in a peri-urban area in central Croatia in 2021 and 2023. Emissions were measured using the static method in a closed chamber, accompanied by measurements of soil temperature, moisture, and total porosity. In both years, grassland and orchards had the highest average soil C-CO2 emissions, whereas cropland showed consistently lower values. However, total soil C-CO2 emissions were significantly lower in 2023, probably influenced by higher precipitation and changes in soil moisture. The seasonal trends differed from year to year, with the highest emissions recorded in fall 2021 and spring 2023. In both years, there was a positive correlation between average soil C-CO2 emissions and soil temperature/moisture, while soil porosity also contributed to the observed emission variations. The results show the significant influence of land use types on soil C-CO2 emissions and emphasize the importance of seasonal and environmental factors in assessing soil carbon cycling. This research enhances understanding of soil contributions to climate change and supports the development of sustainable land management practices aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Detangling ecosystem services: Open-field manipulation of soil-dwelling microarthropods provides new opportunities to investigate their effects on nitrogen cycling
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Soil microarthropods have a pivotal role in soil nitrogen cycling in that they affect microbial decomposers. A high abundance of microarthropods may increase the mobility of inorganic nitrogen ions in the soil, mainly in nitrogen-limited habitats. However, it is difficult to study ecological processes with small-sized, soil-dwelling arthropods. The effects of soil microarthropods on nitrogen cycling have mainly been studied in laboratory microcosm experiments. Therefore, we face many practical issues in investigating these effects under field conditions that remain to be resolved. We developed an open-field mesocosm setup with growing plants. In a two-part experiment, spring wheat and grass species were grown in chernozem and sandy soils. Leached ammonium and nitrate ions were measured with percolation lysimeters. Half of the mesocosms included natural assemblages, and the other half included less abundant Acari and Collembola assemblages. The application of nitrogen fertilization assured differences in nitrogen sources. We found a large difference in ammonium and nitrate leaching between the two soil types. In chernozem soil, the leached ion concentrations were higher in mesocosms with more abundant mite and springtail assemblages. The expected patterns were less pronounced in sandy soil. Adding nitrogen fertilizer did not modify the effects of soil microarthropods. Open-field mesocosms are promising for studying the role of soil-dwelling mesofauna in ecological processes. We solved the problem of keeping mesofauna abundance lower in treated plots than that in control plots. Plants successfully grew in our semi-closed systems with functioning percolation lysimeters. The use of the equipment in the experiments in this study helped reveal that the role of soil-dwelling microarthropods in nitrogen cycling depends on the soil type and not on the application of nitrogen fertilizer.

TI  - Long-term application of controlled-release potassium chloride increases maize yield by affecting soil bacterial ecology, enzymatic activity and nutrient supply
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - Context: Soil bacterial community critical for sustaining the ecosystem is sensitive to long-term cultivation, including fertilizer applications. Although have been a lot of controlled-release potassium chloride (CRK) studies, maybe those on soil bacterial ecology related to potassium use efficiency (KUE) and yield are very limited. Objectives: We investigated how different proportions of CRK affected soil bacterial diversity and community structure, carbon/nitrogen cycle enzyme levels, soil nutrient supply, and maize (Zea mays L.) yield.Methods: An eight-year (2014-2021) field experiment using different proportions (0%, 50% and 100%) of CRK at 113 kg K2O ha-1 was conducted to determine the optimal fertilization method.Results: Increasing the percentage of CRK boosted the diversity and abundance of the bacteria (Bacillus, Gaiella, and Sphingomonas) associated with the carbon and nitrogen cycle enzymes. It also enhanced the interaction intensity between taxa, as slow nutrient release led to taxa with comparable ecological niches coexisting and collaborating to decrease functional redundancy. Increased CRK improved soil fertility significantly, enhanced the composition and function of soil bacterial colonies, and explained 82.8% of the variation in the bacterial colonies; directly increased soil nitrogen cycling enzymes content and the bacterial community relative abundance, and indirectly increased soil nutrient supply by 7.1-38.6%, maize yield by 11.7-11.8% and KUE by 8.4-13.2% points.Conclusions: The higher percentage of CRK significantly enhanced the stability of soil bacterial ecology, improved soil available potassium, ammonium, nitrate, soluble nitrogen contents, and organic matter content, and increased maize yield and KUE. Implications: Long-term CRK application is a good regime to improve maize yield and KUE by regulating soil bacterial biodiversity, carbon/nitrogen cycle enzyme activities, and soil nutrient supply.

TI  - Lakeshore plant removal intensifies microbial phosphorus limitation and weakens multinutrient cycling-bacterial diversity relationship
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Rational management of lakeshore plants can achieve ecological protection and restoration purposes for lakes, whereas influences of lakeshore plant removal on microbial nutrient limitation and linkage between biodiversity and multinutrient cycling (MNC) remain largely unclear. Molecular and statistical analyses were adopted to reveal responses of microbial nutrient limitation and MNC to lakeshore plant removal as well as bacterial adaptability to environmental changes. Activities of sediment enzymes targeting carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles notably decreased after plant removal, and lakeshore plant removal rather than seasonal variation showed larger effects on enzyme activities, ecoenzymatic stoichiometric parameters (i.e., C:N, C:P, and N:P acquisition ratios), and vector analysis parameters (i.e., length and angle). Lakeshore plant removal aggravated sediment microbial phosphorus limitation, and lakeshore plant removal elevated abundances of phosphorus-cycling genes. There was a notable increase in MNC in the water-sediment system after plant removal, and non-nutritional physicochemical factors and phosphorus-cycling genes directly and indirectly affected MNC. There were declined linkages between MNC and taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha-diversities of water and sediment bacteria after plant removal, and non-nutritional physicochemical factors and phosphorus-cycling genes directly and indirectly influenced bacterial diversity. Environmental breadths of bacteria in water and sediment declined after plant removal. Phylogenetic signals of bacteria in water declined after plant removal, but opposite for sediment bacteria. Our results highlighted ecological consequences of lakeshore plant removal regarding microbial nutrient limitation and bacterial diversity maintenance, and findings could guide lake protection and restoration by weakening linkage between bacterial diversity and MNC in water-sediment systems.

TI  - Influence of biodegradable microplastics on soil carbon cycling: Insights from soil respiration, enzyme activity, carbon use efficiency and microbial community
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - The rising prevalence of biodegradable microplastics (BMPs) in soils has raised concerns about their impacts on soil ecosystems and carbon cycling. This study investigates the effects of different BMPs on soil carbon cycling, focusing on soil respiration, enzyme activities, and carbon use efficiency (CUE) from 13C-labeled dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in an upland soil. The BMPs tested were polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and polylactic acid (PLA), at high (H, 1% w/w) and low (L, 0.1% w/w) concentrations. Over a 64-day incubation, cumulative CO2 emissions increased in the PHA_L, PHA_H, and PLA_H treatments, with the highest rise of 665% PHA_H treatment. Microbial biomass carbon (MBC) ranged from 97.73 +/- 3.03 mg C kg-1 in the control to 223.09 +/- 7.91 mg C kg-1 in PHA_H, with microbial CUE peaking at 0.26 in PHA_H. Enzymatic activities were notably affected: beta-glucosidase (BG) increased by 50% in PLA_H, while cellobiohydrolase (CBH) activity decreased by up to 62% in PBAT_H and PLA_L. N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) and phosphatase (AP) activities were highest in PHA_H, indicating enhanced nutrient cycling. Microbial community structure based on PLFAs was significantly altered, with total PLFA content increasing by 191% in PHA_H. Correlation analysis and partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) revealed that BMP concentration, DOC content, and microbial diversity were positively correlated with microbial CUE. This study highlights the significant role of BMPs in influencing soil carbon cycling, primarily through their effects on microbial diversity and soil enzyme activities.

TI  - Shifting abundances of communities associated with nitrogen cycling in soils promoted by sugarcane harvest systems
T2  - LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Sugarcane cultivation supports Brazil as one of the largest world sugar and ethanol producer. In order to understand the impact of changing sugarcane harvest from manual to mechanized harvest, we studied the effect of machinery traffic on soil and consequently soil compaction upon soil microbial communities involved in nitrogen cycling. The impact of sugarcane harvest was dependent on soil depth and texture. At deeper soil layers, mechanized harvesting increases the abundance of nitrogen fixers and denitrifying communities (specificallynosZ clade I and II) while manual harvesting increases the abundance of ammonia oxidizers (specifically AOA) and increases denitrifying communities (nosZ clade I and II) on top and at intermediate depth. The effect of change on the harvest system is more evident on sandy soil than on clay soil, where soil indicators of compaction (bulk density and penetration resistance) were negatively correlated with soil microorganisms associated with the nitrogen cycle. Our results point to connections between soil compaction and N transformations in sugarcane fields, besides naming biological variables to be used as proxies for alterations in soil structure.

TI  - Green manure (Ophiopogon japonicus) cover promotes tea plant growth by regulating soil carbon cycling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction: In mountainous tea plantations, which are the primary mode of tea cultivation in China, issues such as soil erosion and declining soil fertility are particularly severe. Although green manure cover is an effective agricultural measure for restoring soil fertility, its application in mountainous tea plantations has been relatively understudied. Methods: This study investigated the effects of continuous green manure cover using the slope-protecting plant Ophiopogon japonicus on tea plant growth and soil microbial community structure. We implemented three treatments: 1 year of green manure coverage, 2 years of coverage, and a control, to study their effects on tea plant growth, soil physicochemical properties, and soil bacterial and fungal communities. Results: Results demonstrate that green manure coverage significantly promote the growth of tea plants, enhanced organic matter and pH levels in soil, and various enzyme activities, including peroxidases and cellulases. Further functional prediction results indicate that green manure coverage markedly promoted several carbon cycling functions in soil microbes, including xylanolysis, cellulolysis, degradation of aromatic compounds, and saprotrophic processes. LEfSe analysis indicated that under green manure cover, the soil tends to enrich more beneficial microbial communities with degradation functions, such as Sphingomonas, Sinomonas, and Haliangium (bacteria), and Penicillium, Apiotrichum, and Talaromyce (fungi). In addition. Random forest and structural equation models indicated that carbon cycling, as a significant differentiating factor, has a significant promoting effect on tea plant growth. Discussion: In the management practices of mountainous tea plantations, further utilizing slope-protecting plants as green manure can significantly influence the soil microbial community structure and function, enriching microbes involved in the degradation of organic matter and aromatic compounds, thereby positively impacting tea tree growth and soil nutrient levels.

TI  - Soil pH modulates microbial nitrogen cycling under integrated soil-crop system management across agroecosystems
T2  - SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Soil pH positively correlated with the metagenomic abundance of nitrification.Soil pH negatively correlated with the metagenomic abundance of denitrification.ISSM increased total nitrogen cycle gene abundance in more acidic soils.Integrated Soil-Crop System Management (ISSM) has emerged as an effective approach to improve nutrient cycling and crop yield in China. However, its pH-dependent impact on the nitrogen (N) cycling capacity of soil microbiome remains largely unexplored, despite the critical role of pH in shaping microbial processes. Here, we employed comprehensive metagenomic analysis across multiple agricultural sites in China to investigate the effects of ISSM on the N-cycling potential along soil pH gradients, with Farmland's Practice (FP) as a reference. Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria dominated microbial communities across all treatments and pH conditions, accounting for 88%-90% of the total abundance. Microbial alpha diversity remained consistent across the pH gradient, but exhibited significant negative correlations with soil organic carbon and total N. Soil pH showed a strong positive correlation with the abundance of genes associated with nitrification, but showed a negative correlation with denitrification gene abundance. Particularly, ISSM significantly increased the total abundance of nitrogen-cycling genes in the two most acidic soils (LS, GZL), but not in the less acidic (HEB), near-neutral (BD), and alkaline (TY) soils. Relative to FP, the normalized gene abundances associated with denitrification and NH4+ to Org-N were enriched in LS_ISSM, while those related to DNRA, NO3- reduction to ammonia, and nitrification were higher in GZL_ISSM. These results highlight the potential of ISSM to modulate microbial nitrogen cycling and point to the importance of site-specific strategies, particularly in acidic soils, for enhancing nitrogen retention.

TI  - Light grazing enhances microbial-mediated nitrogen transformation in desert steppe soils
T2  - BMC PLANT BIOLOGY
AB  - AimsSoil microorganisms play a central role in nitrogen transformation and availability, yet their regulatory functions in mediating nitrogen transfer between soil and plants under long-term grazing remain poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate how grazing intensity influences soil microbial communities and nitrogen-cycling functional genes, and how these microbial shifts affect nitrogen transformation processes and plant nitrogen uptake in desert steppe ecosystems.MethodsHere, we present a comprehensive study on soil microbes and nitrogen cycling functions in a desert grassland subjected to four grazing intensities - no grazing, light (0.91 sheep/ha), moderate (1.82 sheep/ha), and heavy (2.71 sheep/ha) - over 17 years.ResultsWe found that both the structural composition and the function of soil microbial communities varied across grazing intensities, with more pronounced changes in rhizosphere soil than in bulk soil. The relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling functional genes was generally higher under no grazing or light grazing conditions. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that increases in soil pH under long-term grazing were significantly associated with shifts in microbial communities and with reduced net nitrogen mineralization rates. These changes were further linked to decreased soil nitrogen availability and lower nitrogen content in plant tissues.ConclusionsLight grazing in desert steppe ecosystems partially maintains microbial nitrogen cycling potential by supporting the abundance of nitrogen functional genes and preserving microbial community structure, despite an overall decline in nitrogen mineralization under grazing. These results suggest that low-intensity grazing may help mitigate grazing-induced suppression of nitrogen availability and plant uptake.

AB  - Soil carbon stock and soil CO2 flux are the major components of carbon budget and carbon cycle in the different terrestrial ecosystems of the world. Soils are the largest carbon reservoirs of the terrestrial carbon cycle. About three times more carbon is contained in soils than in the world's vegetation and soils hold double the amount of carbon that is present in the atmosphere. Soil can be source or sink of greenhouse gases depending on land use and management. The detailed information on soil carbon stock and soil CO2 flux and its controlling factors is critical for constraining the ecosystem C-budget and for understanding the response of soils to changing land use and global climate change. Therefore, we examined the soil carbon stock and CO2 flux in the different terrestrial ecosystems, i. e. forest, bamboo and grasslands of north-east India and its controlling of biotic and abiotic factors. Soil organic carbon was found to be highest in bamboo and followed by grassland and forests whereas reverse trend was observed in rate of soil CO2 flux which was in the order of forest > grassland > bamboo forest and were influenced by biotic and abiotic factors.

T2  - SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE REVIEWS 37: CARBON SEQUESTRATION, VOL. 1: INTRODUCTION AND BIOCHEMICAL METHODS
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels have been rapidly rising in the atmosphere following the beginning of industrialisation and reaching new highs in the last recent years. Global carbon cycle studies established that the interannual variability in observed atmospheric CO2 growth rates is attributed mainly to interannual inconsistent changes in carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems, instead to oceans or changes in anthropogenic emissions. This terrestrial ecosystems sink is mainly in the forests of the world, which are enormous repositories of both biomass and soil carbon. In 1997, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) at Kyoto agreed on a protocol with an aim of reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the atmosphere through terrestrial ecosystems CO2 sequestration. This ignited increased interest and efforts from the science community since the beginning of the twenty-first century, to probe the potential of terrestrial ecosystems CO2 assimilation in offsetting the anthropogenic CO2 impact in the atmosphere and subsequently in the global climate; this also inspired investigations on the role of environment and climate variables on the land ecosystems carbon sequestration.
   This study reviews the developments in the understanding of the role of the terrestrial biosphere mainly the forests in anthropogenic carbon sequestration. It first examines the influence of the environment and climate variables in the global carbon cycle processes of the terrestrial ecosystems, including the effects of climate extremes. Then it assimilates the knowledge in global carbon budget generated in the past few decades. Studies indicate that the combined effect of nitrogen deposition, high atmospheric CO2, warm climate, increased diffuse radiation support the capability of the terrestrial ecosystems to assimilate atmospheric carbon. Extreme climate change events and disturbances (ECE&D) can transform land ecosystems from sinks into sources. The aggregate of the global terrestrial ecosystems CO2 net sink has been growing in the sequence of 0.1 +/- 0.8, 1.1 +/- 0.9 and 1.5 +/- 0.9 Pg C year(-1), in the past few decades of the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, respectively. Current global tree cover has increased by 7.1% relative to the 1982 level. The global forests are a substantial and persistence carbon sink.

TI  - Continuous Four-Year Biogas Slurry Application Regulates the Soil Fertility, Microbial Communities, and Nitrogen Cycling Functions in a Farmland Ecosystem
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Biogas slurry (BS) is widely applied as a crop fertilizer due to its high available nitrogen content. However, the effects of continuous BS application on soil fertility and nitrogen cycling in the farmland ecosystem remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the continuous four-year BS application on soil properties, enzyme activity, microbial communities, and nitrogen cycling functions in a farmland field. The results showed that BS could increase soil alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, total and available phosphorus, available potassium, organic matter, and the soil NH4 +-N and NO3 --N concentrations over time. Moreover, BS application also changed the activities of key soil enzymes (e.g., urease, nitrate reductase, catalase, and phosphatase). Furthermore, the high-throughput sequencing revealed an increase in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, and decreases in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Nitrospiraceae with continuous BS application. With the BS application years increasing, the abundance of amoA-AOB initially increased and then declined, while the nitrogen cycling genes (e.g., narG, nirS, norB, and nosZ) exhibited significant alterations. Overall, these shifts indicate that continuous BS improves soil nutrient status and enzyme-mediated processes while reshaping bacterial community structure and the expression of key nitrogen-functional genes. This work provides new insights into the fertility benefits and the microbial-ecological trade-offs of repeated BS fertilization.

TI  - EFFECT OF LAND-USE PATTERNS ON SOIL ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY AND MICROBIAL DYNAMICS IN CARBON, NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS CYCLING OF WETLANDS IN THE LESSER KHINGAN MOUNTAINS, NORTHEASTERN CHINA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Land use patterns significantly influence soil enzyme activities, microbial communities, and soil physicochemical properties. This study investigates the effects of land use changes on enzyme activity, soil properties, and bacterial communities in soil aggregates within reclaimed and no-tillage wetlands in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, Northeastern China. Forest wetlands converted to reclaimed and no-tillage systems showed declines in soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, cation exchange capacity, enzyme activities, and available phosphorus. Microbial diversity increased with changes in community composition, including higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Soil aggregate micro-environments modulated enzyme response intensity, with SOC negatively correlated with Firmicutes, Acidobacteriota, Chloroflexi, and Gemmatimonadota, while available phosphorus (AP) positively correlated with Nitrospirota, Latescibacterota, and Bacteroidota. The results reveal that land use changes have a more pronounced impact on microbial communities than aggregate size, emphasizing the critical role of sustainable land management in maintaining soil health. This study highlights the need for rational development of marshes in the Lesser Khingan Mountains, considering enzyme activities and microbial dynamics in nutrient cycling. These findings contribute to understanding the ecological implications of land use changes and support evidence-based conservation and sustainable management practices.

TI  - Soil biota, carbon cycling and crop plant biomass responses to biochar in a temperate mesocosm experiment
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aims Biochar addition to soil is a carbon capture and storage option with potential to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations, yet the consequences for soil organisms and linked ecosystem processes are inconsistent or unknown. We tested biochar impact on soil biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and their interactions, in temperate agricultural soils.
   Methods We performed a 27-month factorial experiment to determine effects of biochar, soil texture, and crop species treatments on microbial biomass (PFLA), soil invertebrate density, crop biomass and ecosystem CO2 flux in plant-soil mesocosms.
   Results Overall soil microbial biomass, microarthropod abundance and crop biomass were unaffected by biochar, although there was an increase in fungal-bacterial ratio and a positive relationship between the 16:1 omega 5 fatty acid marker of AMF mass and collembolan density in the biochar-treated mesocosms. Ecosystem CO2 fluxes were unaffected by biochar, but soil carbon content of biochar-treated mesocosms was significantly lower, signifying a possible movement/loss of biochar or priming effect.
   Conclusions Compared to soil texture and crop type, biochar had minimal impact on soil biota, crop production and carbon cycling. Future research should examine subtler effects of biochar on biotic regulation of ecosystem production and if the apparent robustness to biochar weakens over greater time spans or in combination with other ecological perturbations.

TI  - Altitude-induced shifts in bacterial communities involved in soil organic phosphorus cycling on Taibai mountain
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Soil phosphorus cycle is crucial for maintaining ecological balance and promoting ecosystem development, with microorganisms serving as key drivers of this process. Soil phoD-encoding bacteria are vital for enhancing plant nutrient uptake and sustaining the functions of montane forest ecosystems. However, the patterns and potential mechanisms underlying phoD-encoding bacterial communities across altitudinal gradients in alpine forest soils remain unclear. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing, this study examined the impact of altitude, vegetation, and soil factors on phoD-encoding bacteria in alpine forest soils. The results showed that altitude significantly affected the diversity and composition of phoD-encoding bacterial communities in alpine forest soils. The alpha diversity of phoD-encoding bacteria in low-altitude soils (2210 m) was significantly higher than that in other altitude ranges (P < 0.05). As altitudinal gradient increased, the number of nodes and edges within the bacterial networks encoding phoD consistently decreased, leading to reduced network complexity and weakened inter-community interactions. Simultaneously, phoD-encoding bacterial community structure exhibited comparable structural features at similar altitudes. Notably, Pseudomonas and Actinobacteria were dominant groups carrying the phoD gene in high-altitude forest ecosystems, playing key roles in the soil phosphorus cycle. Altitude, soil pH, and plant diversity were identified as the main factors driving the structure of soil phoD-encoding bacterial communities. The altitude differentiation of phoD-encoding bacteria revealed the spatial heterogeneity of phosphate mineralization ability, and the effect of plant diversity on phoD-encoding bacteria indicated that plant species selection and soil microbial function should be considered in future vegetation restoration and management. This study offered new insights into phosphorus cycling mechanisms in mountainous ecosystems and provided scientific guidance for climate change adaptation and alpine forest management.

TI  - Carbon and nitrogen isotope variations in tree-rings as records of perturbations in regional carbon and nitrogen cycles
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Increasing anthropogenic pollution from urban centers and fossil fuel combustion can impact the carbon and nitrogen cycles in forests. To assess the impact of twentieth century anthropogenic pollution on forested system carbon and nitrogen cycles, variations in the carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of tree-rings were measured. Individual annual growth rings in trees from six sites across Ontario and one in New Brunswick, Canada were used to develop site chronologies of tree-ring delta N-15 and delta C-13 values. Tree-ring delta N-15 values were similar to 0.5% higher and correlated with contemporaneous foliar samples from the same tree, but not with delta N-15 values of soil samples. Temporal trends in carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of these tree-rings are consistent with increasing anthropogenic influence on both the carbon and nitrogen cycles since 1945. Tree-ring delta C-13 values and delta N-15 values are correlated at both remote and urban-proximal sites, with delta N-15 values decreasing since 1945 and converging on 1% at urban-proximal sites and decreasing but not converging on a single delta N-15 value in remote sites. These results indicate that temporal trends in tree-ring nitrogen and carbon isotopic compositions record the regional extent of pollution.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of the differential impacts of arbuscular and ectomycorrhiza on soil carbon cycling
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - A significant fraction of carbon stored in the Earth's soil moves through arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and ectomycorrhiza (EM). The impacts of AM and EM on the soil carbon budget are poorly understood. We propose a method to quantify the mycorrhizal contribution to carbon cycling, explicitly accounting for the abundance of plant-associated and extraradical mycorrhizal mycelium. We discuss the need to acquire additional data to use our method, and present our new global database holding information on plant species-by-site intensity of root colonization by mycorrhizas. We demonstrate that the degree of mycorrhizal fungal colonization has globally consistent patterns across plant species. This suggests that the level of plant species-specific root colonization can be used as a plant trait. To exemplify our method, we assessed the differential impacts of AM:EM ratio and EM shrub encroachment on carbon stocks in sub-arctic tundra. AM and EM affect tundra carbon stocks at different magnitudes, and via partly distinct dominant pathways: via extraradical mycelium (both EM and AM) and via mycorrhizal impacts on above- and belowground biomass carbon (mostly AM). Our method provides a powerful tool for the quantitative assessment of mycorrhizal impact on local and global carbon cycling processes, paving the way towards an improved understanding of the role of mycorrhizas in the Earth's carbon cycle.

TI  - Selective logging impacts on soil microbial communities and functioning in Bornean tropical forest
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Rainforests provide vital ecosystem services that are underpinned by plant-soil interactions. The forests of Borneo are globally important reservoirs of biodiversity and carbon, but a significant proportion of the forest that remains after large-scale agricultural conversion has been extensively modified due to timber harvest. We have limited understanding of how selective logging affects ecosystem functions including biogeochemical cycles driven by soil microbes. In this study, we sampled soil from logging gaps and co-located intact lowland dipterocarp rainforest in Borneo. We characterised soil bacterial and fungal communities and physicochemical properties and determined soil functioning in terms of enzyme activity, nutrient supply rates, and microbial heterotrophic respiration. Soil microbial biomass, alpha diversity, and most soil properties and functions were resistant to logging. However, we found logging significantly shifted soil bacterial and fungal community composition, reduced the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi, increased the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and reduced soil inorganic phosphorous concentration and nitrate supply rate, suggesting some downregulation of nutrient cycling. Within gaps, canopy openness was negatively related to ectomycorrhizal abundance and phosphomonoesterase activity and positively related to ammonium supply rate, suggesting control on soil phosphorus and nitrogen cycles via functional shifts in fungal communities. We found some evidence for reduced soil heterotrophic respiration with greater logging disturbance. Overall, our results demonstrate that while many soil microbial community attributes, soil properties, and functions may be resistant to selective logging, logging can significantly impact the composition and abundance of key soil microbial groups linked to the regulation of vital nutrient and carbon cycles in tropical forests.

TI  - Microplastic effects on carbon cycling processes in soils
T2  - PLOS BIOLOGY
AB  - Microplastics (MPs), plastic particles <5 mm, are found in environments, including terrestrial ecosystems, planetwide. Most research so far has focused on ecotoxicology, examining effects on performance of soil biota in controlled settings. As research pivots to a more ecosystem and global change perspective, questions about soil-borne biogeochemical cycles become important. MPs can affect the carbon cycle in numerous ways, for example, by being carbon themselves and by influencing soil microbial processes, plant growth, or litter decomposition. Great uncertainty surrounds nano-sized plastic particles, an expected by-product of further fragmentation of MPs. A major concerted effort is required to understand the pervasive effects of MPs on the functioning of soils and terrestrial ecosystems; importantly, such research needs to capture the immense diversity of these particles in terms of chemistry, aging, size, and shape.

TI  - Fertilizing-induced alterations of microbial functional profiles in soil nitrogen cycling closely associate with crop yield
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Fertilization and rhizosphere selection are key regulators for soil nitrogen (N) cycling and microbiome. Thus, clarifying how the overall N cycling processes and soil microbiome respond to these factors is a prerequisite for understanding the consequences of high inputs of fertilizers, enhancing crop yields, and formulating reasonable nitrogen management strategies under agricultural intensification scenarios. To do this, we applied shotgun metagenomics sequencing to reconstruct N cycling pathways on the basis of abundance and distribution of related gene families, as well as explored the microbial diversity and interaction via high throughput sequencing based on a two-decade fertilization experiment in Loess Plateau of China semiarid area. We found that bacteria and fungi respond divergent to fertilization regimes and rhizosphere selection, in terms of community diversity, niche breadth, and microbial co-occurrence networks. Moreover, organic fertilization decreased the complexity of bacterial networks but increased the complexity and stability of fungal networks. Most importantly, rhizosphere selection exerted more strongly influences on the soil overall nitrogen cycling than the application of fertilizers, accompanied by the increase in the abundance of nifH, NIT-6, and narI genes and the decrease in the abundance of amoC, norC, and gdhA genes in the rhizosphere soil. Furthermore, keystone families screening from soil microbiome (e.g., Sphingomonadaceae, Sporichthyaceae, and Mortierellaceae), which were affected by the edaphic variables, contributed greatly to crop yield. Collectively, our findings emphasize the pivotal roles of rhizosphere selection interacting with fertilization regimes in sustaining soil nitrogen cycling processes in response to decades-long fertilization, as well as the potential importance of keystone taxa in maintaining crop yield. These findings significantly facilitate our understanding of nitrogen cycling in diverse agricultural soils and lay a foundation for manipulating specific microorganisms to regulate N cycling and promote agroecosystem sustainability.

TI  - Organic management promotes nitrogen transformation in tea plantations soil: A case study from southwestern China
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The insufficient soil nitrogen supply and its transformation mechanisms, along with the impact of organic management at various growth stages of tea plants on soil nitrogen cycling in organic tea plantations, are poorly understood. To elucidate the nitrogen transformation mechanism and enhance agronomic practices in organic tea plantations, we investigated the soil nitrogen-cycling microbiome and nitrogen cycling abundance (reflecting nitrogen transformation potential) in tea plantations aged 11, 16, and 24 years under both organic management (OM) and conventional management (CM). Specifically, OM11, OM16, and OM24 represent plantations that transitioned to organic management during the cultivating period (seedling stage), at 2 years old (juvenile stage), and at 10 years old (adult stage), respectively. The results demonstrated that the nitrogen transformation potential was enhanced by 28 % and 37 % in OM16 and OM24 compared to CM, respectively. In OM16, the abundance of nirD in dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRD) reduced by 53 %, while genes involved in assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRD), DNRD, denitrification, nitrate assimilation, methylaspartate cycle, and nitrogen fixation had an increase of 24 %-2900 % compared to CM16. Meanwhile, in OM24, genes involved in DNRD, denitrification, nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and methylaspartate cycle exhibited a 50 %-1200 % increase over CM24. Microorganisms involved in soil nitrogen cycling were similar between OM and CM, while their abundance varied significantly. The pH and Betaproteobacteria were the key factors influencing nitrogen transformation. In summary, these results underscored the positive effect of long-term organic management on the nitrogen transformation in the tea plantation soil, and it exhibited a significant promoting effect when organic management was initiated at 2 years old (juvenile stage) and 10 years old (adult stage).

TI  - Application of δ18O-PO4 analysis to recognize phosphate pollutions in eutrophic water
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY
AB  - Phosphorus, like nitrogen, belongs to crucial bioelements limiting the biomass multiplication. While surplus of phosphorous in soil is beneficial for agriculture and forestry, its excess in surficial waters causes increased eutrophication, which is devastating for water quality and for ecological balance. Anthropogenic eutrophication is one of the biggest environmental problems of last decades, therefore studies which can improve the assessment of water quality are very important. In the case of phosphates, the most abundant form of phosphorus in lithosphere and hydrosphere, isotopic composition of oxygen (delta O-18-PO4) could be used as a tracer of phosphorus cycling between the biomass, soils, waters and sediments. Here we present a short review of methods that allow to determine the oxygen isotopic composition in phosphates extracted from different water solutions. We also provide examples of usefulness of this research in the environmental studies. With some limitations, measurements of delta O-18-PO4 could be an usefull tool to recognize the sources of phosphates and broaden understanding of processes occurring in phosphorus cycle. This knowledge is necessary to protect our drinking water resources and their revitalization. (C) 2021 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Divergent profiles of rhizosphere soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in Pinus massoniana provenances with different types of carbon storage
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction In subtropical China, P. massoniana is a timber tree species which have a great potential for carbon sequestration. However, few studies have investigated how varying levels of carbon storage in P. massoniana provenances affect the soil microbial functional potential related to nutrient cycling within the rhizosphere.Methods In this investigation, metagenomic sequencing was employed to explore the differences in carbon and nitrogen cycling capabilities among rhizosphere microbial communities within P. massoniana provenances, categorized by high, medium, and low levels of carbon storage.Results Our findings revealed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Acidobacteriota and Ascomycota by 23 and 61%, respectively, whereas Basidiomycota significantly decreased by 8% in the rhizosphere of P. massoniana provenances with high carbon storage compared with those with low carbon storage. The variability in carbon storage among P. massoniana provenances was linked to marked disparities in the presence of key genes essential for carbon and nitrogen cycling within their rhizosphere soils.Discussion Notably, in P. massoniana provenances characterized by high carbon storage, the rhizosphere presented a significantly elevated presence of genes associated with carbon decomposition, carbon assimilation, methane generation, and denitrification, in stark contrast to provenances with medium and low carbon storage. Furthermore, P. massoniana provenances with high carbon storage rates presented increased transformation and availability of soil carbon and nitrogen, along with increased potential for ecological restoration. Moreover, the rhizosphere soil nitrification of P. massoniana provenances with low carbon storage surpassed that of other provenances, leading to increased available nitrogen content and elevated nitrate leaching risk. In the P. massoniana rhizosphere, critical soil factors, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), pH, and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content, significantly shape the functionality of genes associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling. In conclusion, our study lays a scientific foundation for establishing P. massoniana plantations and identifying P. massoniana provenances with superior ecological value and potential.

TI  - Plant-soil feedback drives the 'nursing effect' on Sitka spruce
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - The productivity of economically valuable focal trees in mixtures is often improved by inclusion of lower-value nursing species, but the mechanisms underpinning such effects are poorly resolved. This gap in understanding limits the capacity to develop efficient planting strategies for forests and woodlands to contribute to net-zero and other critical ecosystem functions. Here, we undertook a plant-soil feedback experiment to test the hypothesis that feedback effects improve the biomass of Sitka spruce [Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr] in soil conditioned by monocultures of heterospecific nurse species, and a mixture comprising Sitka spruce and heterospecifics, compared to soil conditioned by only Sitka spruce. Sitka spruce saplings had greater biomass in soil conditioned by Scots pine monocultures (Pinus sylvestris L.) and the mixture compared to their own soil or soil conditioned by silver birch (Betula pendula Roth). Statistical models showed that colonization of ectomycorrhizal fungi on tree roots in the feedback phase was positively related to seedling biomass, and significantly influenced plant growth strategy. Soil inorganic nitrogen concentrations were strongly affected by monocultures and mixtures in the conditioning phase, but these effects were not related to biomass of seedlings in the feedback phase. However, the positive associations among microbial biomass nitrogen, extractable ammonium in soil, and the activity of the nitrogen-degrading enzyme N-acetylglucosaminidase may influence seedling biomass in the longer-term by stimulating nitrogen cycling. Synthesis and applications. Our findings show that in the crucial early phases of tree growth, plant-soil feedback plays an important role in shaping productivity of Sitka spruce and the nitrogen cycle in forest soils, the latter which may have important consequences for tree biomass in the longer-term. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the nursing effect in the early stages of plant growth and provide a mechanistic explanation both for long-held observations of nursing effects in forestry systems and for biodiversity effects in natural woodlands. The nursing effect was largely driven by the activity of symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi, and therefore it is important for practitioners to ensure nursing species monocultures or mixtures support ectomycorrhizal fungi that are compatible with high-value target species.

TI  - Ecosystem gas exchange across a created salt marsh chronosequence
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - Salt marshes created on dredge spoil were compared to natural marshes to evaluate the capacity of created marshes to perform carbon cycle functions. Several carbon cycle attributes were measured in eight created Spartina alterniflora Loisel salt marshes that ranged from one to 28 years, each paired with a nearby mature natural reference marsh. The attributes measured included gross primary production, respiration, net ecosystem exchange, potential microbial respiration (CH4 and CO2), and above ground biomass. In situ exchange rates of CO2 and plant biomass in created marshes met or exceeded those of reference marshes in three to four years. There was some evidence that ecosystem gas exchange in created marshes developed slightly faster than aboveground biomass production. Soil carbon mineralization per gram carbon was generally higher in the created marshes than reference marshes, suggesting higher carbon quality and/or nutrient availability in the created marshes. However, carbon mineralization rates per gram soil were relatively low in the created marshes due to lower soil organic matter content. With proper construction, we suggest most major carbon fluxes can be established in created salt marshes in less than five years.

TI  - The nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin has non-target effects on the soil microbial community structure, composition, and functions
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Nitrapyrin is a nitrification inhibitor used to retain ammonia-N in soil to improve crop yields and quality. Nitrapyrin targets specifically the ammonia oxidizers, but it is not known if it has non-target effects on the soil microbial communities. Here, we tested the hypothesis that nitrapyrin also leads to large shifts in soil microbial community structure, composition, diversity and functions. To test this hypothesis, we set-up a field experiment where wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. AC Walton) was fertilized with ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and supplemented or not with nitrapyrin. Rhizosphere and bulk soils were sampled twice (at grain filling and harvest), the 16S rRNA gene and ITS region were amplified and sequenced to follow the changes in archaeal, bacterial and fungal community structure, composition and diversity. To assess microbial functions, several genes involved in the nitrogen cycle were quantified by real-time qPCR, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were trapped in the rhizosphere at the moment of sampling. Sampling dates and soil compartments had overwhelming effects on the microbial communities. However, nitrapyrin still significantly affected the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota, Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae and Basidiomycota, and several genera. Nitrapyrin also significantly affected bacterial and fungal community structure, and the abundance of all the N-cycle gene tested, but always in interaction with the sampling date. In contrast, nitrapyrin had no significant effect on the emission of VOCs, where only sampling dates significantly influenced the profiles observed. Our results show that nitrapyrin influences non-target soil- and plant-associated microbial communities. In the longer term, these shifts might counteract the positive effect of nitrapyrin on crop nutrition and greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Effects of warming on carbon and nitrogen cycling in alpine grassland ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau: A meta-analysis
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have caused rapid warming globally, particularly in the alpine regions. The Tibetan Plateau is sensitive to global change and plays an important role in global carbon cycle due to its large area and high carbon density. Although a large number of field manipulative warming experiments have been conducted on the Tibetan Plateau, the general patterns of how warming affects ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles remain unclear. Here we conducted a meta-analysis from 65 publications to synthesize the responses of C and N cycles to warming in the alpine grassland ecosystems across the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that warming significantly increased aboveground (mean 11.0%, 95% CI 1.6-21.4%) and belowground plant biomass (24.3%, 13.7-36.0%), soil dissolved organic C (13.6%, 5.4-22.5%), soil respiration (14.3%, 2.9-27.1%), ecosystem respiration (15.3%, 4.7-27.1%), and soil ammonium N (29.0%, 4.6-59.2%), but did not change soil total organic C (2.4%, -4.4 to 9.7%), soil total N (1.9%, -2.7 to 6.7%), microbial biomass C (5.5%, -4.1 to 16.2%) and microbial biomass N (4.7%, - 7.4 to 18.4%). There were negative relationships between the response ratio of aboveground (P = 0.08, R-2 = 0.05) and particularly below-ground (P < 0.01, R-2 = 0.23) biomass and the duration of warming. Moreover, the effect of warming on ecosystem respiration was positively correlated with the change in soil water content after warming (P = 0.03, R-2 = 0.12). Overall, this study showed that ecosystem C and N cycles were generally stimulated by warming, but soil C and N stocks showed minimal responses to warming in the alpine grassland ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau. This finding suggests that the faster ecosystem C and N cycles under climate warming may not necessarily lead to the loss of soil C and N stocks in the alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau. Future studies should conduct long-term coordinated distributed experiments using consistent methods and pay more attention to subsurface soils and the less-studied central and western regions of the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Effects of Hydrostatic Pressure on the Nitrogen Cycle of Sediment
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB  - We carried out a simulation experiment in a laboratory in order to study the effects of hydrostatic pressure from 0.1 MPa to 1.0 MPa on nitrogen cycles at the water-sediment interface of a freshwater reservoir. The results show that high hydrostatic pressure facilitates the release of nitrogen at the interface and ammonification, but has little influence on denitrification. And high hydrostatic pressure will also significantly increase the activity of dehydrogenases and proteases in the sediment, and has little influence on ureases and nitrate reductase activity. The pressure caused a large accumulation of such pollutants as ammoniacal nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen at the interface, seriously worsening the overlying water quality. As PLFA and PCR-DGGE analysis results show, different hydrostatic pressures will lead to remarkable differences in the microbial community's structure and heredity. Within the range 0.1 MPa to 1.0 MPa, the microbial community structure is more diverse under high hydrostatic pressure than under normal pressure.

TI  - Effect of fertilizer-air-coupled drip irrigation on soil microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling functions
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
AB  - To mitigate water shortages, mulched drip irrigation disrupts soil-air gas exchange, disturbing the balance between gas production and diffusion in the soil. This study explored the effects of nitrogen (N) application and aerated irrigation on the soil microenvironment, greenhouse gas emissions in the root zone, and processing tomato yields. The objective was to offer a theoretical framework and scientific evidence to guide fertilization practices, improve the soil microenvironment, and enhance crop productivity, especially under aerated irrigation. Two irrigation methods (non-aerated [A0] and aerated [A1]) and two N rates (150 kg<middle dot>hm(-)2 [N1] and 270 kg<middle dot>hm(-)2 [N2]) were tested. Results showed that aerated irrigation increased soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), while N application enriched soil nitrogen content. Both aeration and N application elevated N2O and CH4 emissions. Path analysis revealed that fertilization-coupled drip irrigation indirectly influences carbon-nitrogen cycling genes by altering soil nutrient levels, affecting greenhouse gas emissions. Soil nutrients and functional gene abundance directly impacted yield, with nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) showing the most substantial direct effect on processing tomato yield (direct path coefficient = -1.047***). Under A1N2 (aerated irrigation with 270 kg hm(-)2 N), soil nutrient levels improved (total carbon: 25.19 g center dot kg-1, SOC: 18.25 g center dot kg-1, DOC: 93.65 mg center dot kg-1, TN: 0.97 g center dot kg-1, NH4+-N: 2.64 mg center dot kg-1, and NO3--N: 1.18 mg center dot kg-1), resulting in a yield of 32.05 t hm(-)2, a 23.69% increase over increase over A0N1. Aerated irrigation combined with moderate nitrogen application is recommended for sustainable production to enhance soil fertility and crop yields. However, mitigation strategies such as nitrification inhibitors or optimized irrigation schedules should be employed to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.

TI  - Optimized water-nitrogen management enhances soil nitrogen cycling and microbial functions to enhance wheat yield
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsIrrigation and fertilization are critical for soil nitrogen cycling and microbial communities. This study explores the effects of muddy water film hole irrigation with sand-laden water from the Yellow River on soil nitrogen dynamics, microbial communities, and winter wheat productivity.MethodsAn orthogonal experiment tested combinations of sand content (3%, 6%, 9%), irrigation levels (0.5-0.65, 0.6-0.75, 0.7-0.85 FC), and nitrogen rates (100, 160, 220 kg<middle dot>hm-2), with conventional practices as controls. The study examined water and nitrogen management effects on soil nutrients, microbial communities, and nitrogen cycling in winter wheat.Results(1) Optimized water and nitrogen management improved soil nitrogen availability and functional gene expression (e.g., glnA, nifK, amoC). The glnA gene correlated strongly with yield (R2 = 0.824). (2) Ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) positively correlated with yield (R2 = 0.81) and nitrogen use efficiency, emphasizing its role in nitrogen transformation. (3) Optimized treatments increased microbial diversity and activity of key groups (e.g., Sphingomonas, Lysobacter), enhancing nitrogen processes. (4) The T5 treatment (6% sand content, 0.6-0.75 FC, 160 kg<middle dot>hm-2) increased yield by 24.74% and nitrogen efficiency by 2.5 times, improving soil and microbial conditions.ConclusionsNitrogen-cycling genes (e.g., glnA, nirK) and ammonium nitrogen are central to soil nitrogen dynamics and crop productivity. These findings guide sustainable winter wheat cultivation in the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - Revealing the Response of Cucumber Soil Microbial Community Composition and Function to Nitrogen Addition in Northern Chinese Greenhouses
T2  - HORTICULTURAE
AB  - At present, the soil of Chinese greenhouses is experiencing severe nitrogen input in the form of fertilizer, which will cause damage to the soil environment and restrict crop growth in the long run. The response of potential functions of microorganisms as drivers of nutrient cycling and material transformation to nitrogen enrichment has rarely been reported in northern vegetable planting systems. Therefore, we set up four cucumber pot experiments with different nitrogen addition rates (0, 258, 516, and 1032 kg N ha-1 yr-1) in the greenhouse. Bacterial and fungal communities were detected by 16S and ITS rRNA gene sequencing, and bacterial and fungal functional groups were predicted using the FAPROTAX and FUNGuild databases. The findings showed that nitrogen addition induced soil acidification (a decrease of 0.25-1.63 units) significantly reduced microbial diversity and changed the community composition of bacteria and fungi. The relative abundance of bacterial functional groups associated with the nitrogen cycle increased significantly when medium and high levels of nitrogen were added. Conversely, the bacterial functional groups involved in the carbon cycle exhibited the opposite pattern. In this study, NO3- and soil pH were the main factors affecting the soil microbial community and its functional groups. Our results highlight that hydrocarbon degradation and saprophytic fungi may play key roles in yield formation during cucumber cultivation in northern solar greenhouses. In general, adopting a fertilization strategy that ensures low-medium nitrogen availability can contribute to the sustainable progress of facility agriculture.

TI  - Melon/cowpea intercropping pattern influenced the N and C soil cycling and the abundance of soil rare bacterial taxa
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The high use of pesticides, herbicides, and unsustainable farming practices resulted in losses of soil quality. Sustainable farming practices such as intercropping could be a good alternative to traditional monocrop, especially using legumes such as cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp). In this study, different melon and cowpea intercropping patterns (melon mixed with cowpea in the same row (MC1); alternating one melon row and one cowpea row (MC2); alternating two melon rows and one cowpea row (MC3)) were assayed to study the intercropping effect on soil bacterial community through 16S rRNA region in a 3-year experiment. The results indicated that intercropping showed high content of total organic carbon, total nitrogen and ammonium, melon yield, and bacterial diversity as well as higher levels of beneficial soil microorganisms such a Pseudomonas, Aeromicrobium, Niastella, or Sphingomonas which can promote plant growth and plant defense against pathogens. Furthermore, intercropping showed a higher rare taxa diversity in two (MC1 and MC2) out of the three intercropping systems. In addition, N-cycling genes such as nirB, nosZ, and amoA were more abundant in MC1 and MC2 whereas the narG predicted gene was far more abundant in the intercropping systems than in the monocrop at the end of the 3-year experiment. This research fills a gap in knowledge about the importance of soil bacteria in an intercropping melon/cowpea pattern, showing the benefits to yield and soil quality with a decrease in N fertilization.

TI  - The effect of added organic matter on the soil formation of oil-based drill cutting pyrolysis residue
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - In order to explore the effects of added organic matters on the soil formation process of oil-based drill cutting pyrolysis residue, two experiment groups (pure and adding) were studied to indicate the soil microbial community and the function of nitrogen cycling. Samples were collected in the third and fourth years based on the plant growth. The 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing technology and PICRUSt were used to study microbial communities and the function of nitrogen cycling. The results showed that MND1 (2.5-4.5%), Sphingomonas (1.4-2.4%), and other typical oil-degrading bacteria were discovered. The diversity of the microbial community decreased with the duration of the experiment. However, it was higher than that of the background soil. The relative abundance of microbial nitrogen dissimilation reduction (0.9-1.0 parts per thousand) was the highest among the two experiment groups and the background soil. The second and third were denitrification and nitrogen fixation. Nitrification gene abundance was the lowest among the five main steps of nitrogen cycling. The addition of organic matters could improve soil formation of pyrolysis residues. This study provides scientific data for pyrolysis residue to restore soil functions.

TI  - Effects of nitrogen input on soil bacterial community structure and soil nitrogen cycling in the rhizosphere soil of Lycium barbarum L.
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Lycium barbarum L., goji berry, is a precious traditional Chinese medicine and it is homology of medicine and food. Its growth is heavily dependent on nitrogen. The use of chemical fertilizers has significantly promoted the yield of goji berry and the development of the L. barbarum L. industry. However, crop plants are inefficient in the acquisition and utilization of applied nitrogen, it often leads to excessive application of nitrogen fertilizers by producers, which cause negatively impact to the environment ultimately. The exploration of an interaction model which deals with crops, chemical fertilizers, and rhizosphere microbes to improve nitrogen use efficiency, is, therefore, an important research objective to achieve sustainable development of agriculture greatly. In our study, we explored the effects of nitrogen input on soil microbial community structure, soil nitrogen cycling, and the contents of nutrients in L. barbarum fruits. The structure and composition of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere soil of L. barbarum were significantly different under different nitrogen supply conditions, and high nitrogen addition inhibited the diversity and stability of bacterial communities. Low nitrogen input stimulated the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), such as Nitrosospira, catalyzing the first step of the ammonia oxidation process. The results of the GLMM model showed that the level of nitrogen fertilizer (urea) input, the relative abundance of AOB, the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium, and their combinations had significant effects on the soil nitrogen cycling and contents of nutrients in L. barbarum fruits. Therefore, we believe that moderately reducing the use of urea and other nitrogen fertilizers is more conducive to improving soil nitrogen use efficiency and Goji berry fruit quality by increasing the nitrogen cycling potential of soil microorganisms.

TI  - Long-term fertilization causes differential nitrogen utilization efficiency by influencing function genes of nitrogen cycle and species richness in farmland
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Fertilization is an important technology for the improvement of agricultural production capacity in arid areas in northern China. It is of great significance to study the influence mechanism of soil microbial community structure and functional genes of nitrogen cycle on nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) on soil nutrient management and fertility improvement. This study was based on the long-term fertilization positioning test established in 1988 in the loess Plateau, conducted (1) single nitrogen fertilizer (N), (2) single organic fertilizer (M), (3) nitrogen fertilizer increased lower organic fertilizer (M1N), (4) nitrogen fertilizer increased higher organic fertilizer (M2N), (5) no fertilization (CK) as a control. High-throughput sequencing, metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were used to clarify the structure of soil microbial community composition, diversity characteristics and change of major functional genes related to nitrogen cycle, explored the microbial driving mechanism of nitrogen utilization efficiency under different fertilization management. The results showed that nitrogen fertilizer partial productivity (PFPN) decreased with the increase of nitrogen application. Compared with other treatments, the Shannon and Simpson indexes of the N treatment increased by 1.03 %-4.12 (p > 0.05) and 1.04 %-3.13 % (p > 0.05), respectively, and the Chao1 index increased by 3.31 %-9.37 % (p > 0.05), which did not achieve significant difference. The abundance of nitrogen cycle dominant bacteria treated with organic fertilizer increased by 17.65 %-37.68 % (p < 0.05). This study also selected 23 genes involved in assimilation nitrate reduction, dissimilatory ammonia nitrate reduction, nitrification, denitrification pathway. Compared with that of other treatments, M2N of assimilation nitrate reduction genes increased by 10.92 %- 47.07 %, in which, except for N treatment, there was no significant difference between other treatments. Denitrification reaction genes increased by 44.84 %-56.74 % (p < 0.05), which showed no significant difference between treatments N and M2N. Treatment M and M1N have great similarity in the functional gene composition of the nitrogen cycle, mainly pmoC-amoC and nirB in nitrification and dissimilatory ammonia nitrate reduction, while treatment N and M2N showed great similarity, mainly affected by denitrification and assimilation nitrate reduction, and the main affected genes were nirK and nasA. To sum up, the addition of organic fertilizer reduced the dissimilatory ammonia nitrate and nitrification related gene abundance, increased the assimilation nitrate and denitrification related gene abundance. Fertilization amount and species affected PFPN mainly through influencing microbial species richness and nitrogen cycle-dominant pathway. This study could provide theoretical basis for formulating scientific and reasonable fertilization strategies in arid regions from the perspective of soil microorganisms.

TI  - Composition of soil bacterial communities associated with urban stormwater detention basins and their predicted functional roles in N cycle
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Aims Stormwater detention basins serve as vital components in mitigating the adverse effects of urban runoff, and investigating the microbial dynamics within these systems is crucial for enhancing their performance and pollutant removal capabilities. The aim of this study was to examine and compare the soil bacterial communities in two stormwater detention basins located on the Edwards Aquifer in Bexar County, Texas, USA, and evaluate how soil physiochemical properties may affect them. Methods and Results Each basin soil was sampled in two different seasons at varying depths and the structure of microbial communities was examined using paired end Illumina sequencing using V3 and V4 region of 16S rRNA gene. PICRUSt2 was used to predict functional genes in the nitrogen cycle. In addition, soil physicochemical properties such as pH, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus and particle size were examined. A beta diversity analysis revealed that basins had distinctive microbial communities. Additionally, soil particle size, phosphorus and ammonia significantly correlated with some of the dominant phyla in the basins. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria showed a positive correlation with the relative abundances of nitrogen-cycling genes, while Actinobacteria showed a negative correlation. Conclusions This study evaluated the associations between soil physicochemical properties and microbial community dynamics in stormwater basins. The study also predicts the relative abundance of nitrogen cycling genes, suggesting shared functional traits within microbial communities. The findings have implications for understanding the potential role of microbial communities in nitrogen cycling processes and contribute to developing sustainable stormwater management strategies and protecting water quality in urban areas.

TI  - Metagenomics Reveals the Effects of Organic Material Co-Application on Phosphorus Cycling Functional Genes and Bioavailable Phosphorus
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Phosphorus is essential for crop growth, but excessive use of chemical fertilizers can lead to environmental issues. The incorporation of organic materials has the potential to enhance phosphorus availability and promote soil phosphorus cycling. This study investigated the effects of chemical fertilizer co-application with two organic materials on soil properties and functions. Four treatments were established: (1) chemical fertilizer alone (SC, consisting of urea, ammonium phosphate, and potassium sulfate), (2) chemical fertilizer with corn-straw-derived biochar (SCB), (3) chemical fertilizer with composted manure-based organic fertilizer (SCF), and (4) chemical fertilizer with both biochar and organic fertilizer (SCBF). This study focused on changes in soil properties, bioavailable phosphorus, phosphorus cycling functional genes, and related microbial communities. Compared to SC, the combined application of organic materials significantly increased available phosphorus (AP), alkaline hydrolysis nitrogen (AN), and available potassium (AK), with the SCBF exhibiting the highest increases of 78.76%, 47.47%, and 336.61%, respectively. However, applying organic materials reduced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and acid phosphatase (ACP) activities, except for the increase in ACP in SCBF. Additionally, bioavailable phosphorus increased by up to 157.00% in SCBF. Adding organic materials significantly decreased organic phosphorus mineralization genes (phoA, phoD, phnP) and phosphate degradation genes (ppk2), while increasing inorganic phosphorus solubilization genes (pqqC, gcd), which subsequently increased CaCl2-P and Citrate-P contents in SCB and in SCBF. In summary, organic material application significantly enhances phosphorus bioavailability by improving soil physicochemical properties and phosphorus-related gene abundance. These findings provide new insights into sustainable soil fertility management and highlight the potential of integrating organic materials with chemical fertilizers to improve soil nutrient availability, thereby contributing to increased soybean yield. Moreover, this study advances our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving phosphorus cycling under combined fertilization strategies, offering a scientific basis for optimizing fertilization practices in agroecosystems.

TI  - Linking ecosystem multifunctionality to microbial community features in rivers along a latitudinal gradient
T2  - MSYSTEMS
AB  - Microorganisms regulate numerous ecosystem functions and show considerable differences along a latitudinal gradient. Although studies have revealed the latitudinal patterns of microbial community structure and single ecosystem function, the latitudinal patterns of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) and how microbial communities affect EMF along a latitudinal gradient remain unclear. Here, we collected channel sediments, riparian rhizosphere soils, and riparian bulk soils from 30 rivers across China and calculated EMF using 18 variables related to nitrogen cycling, nutrient pool, plant productivity, and water quality. We also determined microbial diversity (taxonomic and functional) and microbial network complexity using metagenomic sequencing. The results showed that EMF significantly decreased with increasing latitude in riparian rhizosphere and bulk soils but not in channel sediments. Microbial taxonomic and functional richness (observed species) in channel sediments were significantly higher in the low-latitude group than in the high-latitude group. However, microbial co-occurrence networks were more complex in the high-latitude group compared with the low-latitude group. Abiotic factors, primarily geographic and climatic factors, contributed more to EMF than microbial diversity and network complexity parameters in which only betweenness centralization had a significant relationship with EMF. Together, this study provides insight into the latitudinal pattern of EMF in rivers and highlights the importance of large-scale factors in explaining such latitudinal patterns.
   IMPORTANCE Ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) is the capacity of an ecosystem to provide multiple functions simultaneously. Microorganisms, as dominant drivers of belowground processes, have a profound effect on ecosystem functions. Although studies have revealed the latitudinal patterns of microbial community structure and single ecosystem function, the latitudinal patterns of EMF and how microbial communities affect EMF along a latitudinal gradient remain unclear. We collected channel sediments, riparian rhizosphere soils, and riparian bulk soils from 30 rivers along a latitudinal gradient across China and calculated EMF using 18 variables related to nitrogen cycling, nutrient pool, plant productivity, and water quality. This study fills a critical knowledge gap regarding the latitudinal patterns and drivers of EMF in river ecosystems and gives new insights into how microbial diversity and network complexity affect EMF from a metagenomic perspective.

TI  - ACIDIFICATION RATES IN THE CENTRAL WHEAT-BELT OF WESTERN-AUSTRALIA .1. ON A DEEP YELLOW SAND
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
AB  - The rate and mechanisms of acidification were determined on a deep yellow sand under a cereal-annual pasture rotation in Western Australia. The rate of acidification was determined from a linear regression analysis between soil pH and years since clearing, using 39 sites that had been cleared for 12-74 years. Uncleared sites were sampled. Soil was sampled to a depth of 80 cm in 10-cm increments. The rate of acidification (kmol H+/ha.year) was calculated from the rate of pH decline, the pH buffer capacity, and bulk density.
   The rate of acidification 12-74 years since clearing was estimated as 0.19-0.23 kmol H+/ha.year, requiring 10-11 kg CaCO3/ha.year to neutralise. The greatest acidification occurred in the 10-20 and 20-30 cm layers, with acidification occurring to a depth of 80 cm. The rate of pH decline for each depth below 10 cm was 0.007 units/year. The surface soil (0-10 cm) did not acidify.
   The contribution of potential acidifying processes was estimated using soil measurements and paddock histories. The main cause of acidification appears to be the carbon cycle (grain removal and removal of animal products and waste products to sheep camps), with negligible acidification from the nitrogen cycle. Possible errors in the methodology are discussed.

TI  - Examining the soil bacterial community under the combined influence of water-absorbing polymer and plant subjected to drought stress
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims The use of water-absorbing polymers (WAP) in soils for mitigating water stress is well known. However, the influence of WAP on the soil microbiota and hence, plant growth in soils. The objective of this study is to quantify the combined influence of water absorbing polymer (WAP) amendment and vegetation on the bacterial community of an agricultural soil when subjected to drought conditions.
   Methods In this study, two WAPs along with the plant species Phaseolus vulgaris L. (common bean) were considered to study its impact on the soil bacterial community under controlled environment conditions (greenhouse). The soil bacterial community was assessed using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing at three stages of bean growth. Additionally, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was performed to identify soil constituents and their correlation with bacterial changes.
   Results Results demonstrated significant alterations in bacterial community composition and diversity with WAP application. Notably, the combined effects of WAP and plant species under drought resulted in a synergistic interaction between plant development and treatment. Enrichment of Proteobacteria, Gemmntinonadetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Bacteroidetes was observed, while Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes showed a decreasing trend. Furthermore, WAP amendment in the presence of plants led to increased nitrogen (5.8%), phosphorus (1.9%), and potassium (7.35) (NPK) concentrations in the soil.
   Conclusions These findings highlight the significant positive impact of WAP as a soil amendment on the bacterial community and improved nutrient availability (carbon cycle, nitrogen cycling and fixation, phosphorus availability) in the soil matrix, thereby promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Nitrogen cycling at treeline:: Latitudinal and elevational patterns across a boreal landscape
T2  - ECOSCIENCE
AB  - We studied spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen pools and fluxes in soils at treeline and forested sites within three mountain ranges across a 785-km transect in Alaska during 2001-2002. We measured pools of soil mineral (ammonium and nitrate) and organic (amino acid and microbial biomass) nitrogen, in situ rates of net mineralization, net nitrification, net amino acid production, and decomposition, as well as soil carbon turnover in a laboratory incubation experiment. Soils at treeline were mostly colder than forested soils, particularly during fall and over winter, and had reduced rates of nitrogen cycling and litter decomposition relative to forested stands. Treeline soils also had lower rates of potential respiration per unit carbon, suggesting reduced soil organic matter quality relative to forest soils. Therefore, effects of both colder temperatures and poorer substrate quality appeared to suppress rates of nitrogen turnover at treeline. Seasonal patterns of nitrogen turnover were similar across latitudes (i.e., mountain ranges). On average, 70% of total annual net nitrogen mineralization occurred from August through May, suggesting that fall and winter are critical periods for soil nitrogen transformations in both forested and treeline ecosystems. Among mountain ranges, pool sizes and fluxes of nitrogen were similar despite significant variation in growing season length and mean annual temperatures. Soil moisture and soil organic matter quality may have stronger effects on variation in nitrogen cycling than temperature at our sites.

TI  - Effects of flooding outweigh those of vegetation restoration on key processes of carbon and nitrogen cycling in a degraded riparian zone
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Active revegetation (AR) and natural regeneration (NR) are two restoration approaches widely used to rehabilitate degraded riparian ecosystems, which are subjected to frequent hydrological fluctuations owing to climate change and human activities. Nevertheless, the impacts of restoration approaches and hydrological changes on the key processes of carbon and nitrogen cycling, particularly in degraded riparian ecosystems, remain unclear. In this study, we conducted hydrological experiments, which began in 2016, at three flooding zones (extreme flooding zone, severe flooding zone, and moderate flooding zone) of AR and NR areas in the Three Gorges Reservoir to investigate the effects of restoration approach and hydrological changes on soil properties, vegetation diversity, microbial characteristics, denitrification rates, and greenhouse gas fluxes. The results showed that compared with NR, AR did not change vegetation diversity, microbial diversity, and soil denitrification rates, but decreased soil ammonium and total carbon contents. The vegetation coverage of each flooding zone was more than 90%, and vegetation diversity was relatively high in the moderate flooding zone. Moreover, the maximum denitrification rates and CO2 fluxes were observed in the extreme flooding zone along with a high soil nutrient content. Additionally, the effect of flooding zone superseded the impacts of restoration approaches since AR could only significantly increase the CO2 flux (p < 0.05). Overall, this study elucidates the impacts of restoration approaches and hydrological changes on C and N cycling, and aids in developing restoration strategies for degraded riparian ecosystems.

TI  - Microbial mediation of carbon-cycle feedbacks to climate warming
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of biospheric feedbacks to climate change is critical to project future climate warming(1-3). Although microorganisms catalyse most biosphere processes related to fluxes of greenhouse gases, little is known about the microbial role in regulating future climate change(4). Integrated metagenomic and functional analyses of a long-term warming experiment in a grassland ecosystem showed that microorganisms play crucial roles in regulating soil carbon dynamics through three primary feedback mechanisms: shifting microbial community composition, which most likely led to the reduced temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic soil respiration; differentially stimulating genes for degrading labile but not recalcitrant carbon so as to maintain long-term soil carbon stability and storage; and enhancing nutrient-cycling processes to promote plant nutrient-use efficiency and hence plant growth. Elucidating microbially mediated feedbacks is fundamental to understanding ecosystem responses to climate warming and provides a mechanistic basis for carbon-climate modelling.

TI  - Agricultural fertilization near marshes impacts the potential for greenhouse gas emissions from wetland ecosystems by modifying microbial communities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Ensuring agricultural security and preserving the health of wetland ecosystems are crucial concerns facing northeast China. However, the adverse effects of environmental pollution, especially nitrogen (N), caused by prolonged agricultural development on the health of marsh wetlands cannot be systematically recognized. To address this issue, an 18-year trial with four different levels of N application was carried out in a typical area of the Northeast region: 0, 6, 12, and 24 gN center dot m(-2)center dot a(-1) (referred to as CK, N6, N12, and N24, respectively) to investigate changes in wetland ecological functioning. The results showed that long-term N input significantly enhanced soil N availability. High-level of N addition (N24) significantly reduced soil bacterial richness in October, while fungal diversity was significantly higher in June than in October for both control and N6 treatments. The main environmental factors affecting microorganisms in June were TN, NH4+, and EC, while bacterial and fungal communities were influenced by TN and Leaf Area Index (LAI), respectively, in October. It was found that the AN16S gene was significantly higher in June than in October, indicating that summer is the critical time for N removal in the wetland. N addition significantly reduced the abundance of the NIFH gene and decreased the N fixation potential of the wetland. In June, low and medium levels of N inputs promoted denitrification processes in the wetland and elevated the wetland N2O emission potential. The abundance of NARG, NIRK, and NOSZ genes decreased significantly in October compared to June, indicating a decrease in the wetland N2O emission potential. Additionally, it was observed that soil methanotrophs were positively affected by NH4+ and TN in October, thereby reducing the wetland CH4 emission potential. Our research provides a systematic understanding of the impact of agricultural N pollution on marsh wetlands, which can inform strategies to protect wetland health.

TI  - Development of an environmental microarray to study bacterial and archaeal functional genes in Australian soil agroecosystems
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - Soil biota is responsible for the majority of ecosystem functions in soil, in particular carbon transformations, nutrient cycling, soil structure maintenance, and biological population regulation. An environmental microarray was designed to study key functional genes that facilitate soil processes required for sustainable and productive management of agricultural systems, providing a useful tool for assessing the biological condition of soil. Processes represented included nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, one-carbon degradation, biodegradation of complex organic toxins, and the production of antibiotics. A set of 2934 unique probes was designed from 6420 gene sequences for the target functions across the Bacterial and Archaeal domains. Soil DNA extracted from paired land-use sites (agricultural management and remnant vegetation) and associated with two agriculturally significant Soil Orders, the Dermosols and Calcarosols, was hybridised to the array. A multivariate analysis indicated that the major differences in microbial function could be associated with modification of the soil N cycle following agricultural management. Soils under cropping were associated with higher levels of ammonium (NH4+), and increased frequency of abundance of ammonia monooxygenase genes (amoA). In contrast, soils under grazing management were associated with higher levels of nitrate (NO3-) and increased abundance of nitrogenase genes (nifH). The microarray prototype described here may be a valuable tool in the assessment and description of microbial processes in agriculturally significant Australian soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - Ecosystem changes in Galapagos highlands by the invasive tree Cinchona pubescens
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Various studies address changes in nitrogen and carbon cycling by exotic plant species, while impacts on phosphorus cycling are understudied. Therefore, we assessed the effects of the introduced Cinchona pubescens Vahl on plant and soil nutrients (especially phosphorus) in the highlands of Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos.
   Nutrient analyses were carried out on soil, leaf litter, and leaf samples taken from Cinchona, the endemic shrub Miconia robinsoniana Cogn. and the native fern Pteridium arachnoideum (Kaulf.) Maxon. in plots invaded and previously invaded by Cinchona.
   Cinchona contained significantly more nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in its green leaves than Miconia. Surprisingly, there was no evidence of phosphorus resorption in senesced Cinchona leaves. This was also the case in Miconia leaves, but only in Cinchona-invaded plots. Specific leaf area of Cinchona was significantly higher than of Miconia and Pteridium leaves, as was its litter turnover rate. Total soil nitrogen, ammonium and available phosphorus concentrations were higher in the invaded plots. Leaf litter from these plots also contained more phosphorus, which was positively correlated with the phosphorus concentrations in the soil.
   These results suggest enhanced nutrient uptake by Cinchona and a faster decomposition of its litter, leading to increased nutrient availability in the soil. An accelerated cycling could promote spread of Cinchona and other introduced species, increasing the risk of further displacement of indigenous plant species in the Santa Cruz highlands.

TI  - Diversity of nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying bacteria in biological soil crusts of a revegetation area in Horqin Sandy Land, Northeast China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - The nitrogen cycle affects ecosystem stability. The occurrence of biological soil crusts (BSCs) in a desertified region significantly affects the nitrogen cycle. BSCs are gradually forming on the sand surface of a sand-fixing plantation in semi-arid Horqin Sandy Land, Northeast China. However, the composition of microbial nitrogen-cycling communities remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the diversities of nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying bacteria in BSCs of a sand-fixing plantation. Soil samples were obtained from three plantations, namely, Caragana microphylla Lam., Hedysarum fruticosum, and Artemisia halodendron. The bacterial community was characterized by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), cloning, and sequencing were used to determine the diversities of nifH, ammonia-oxidizing 16S rRNA, and nosZ genes. Results of 16S rDNA gene phylogenetic analysis indicate that the phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were dominant groups. Samples from the three plantations displayed similar DGGE profiles for the three genes, suggesting that plantation type had no influence on the dominant population of nitrogen-cycling bacterial communities. Most sequences of nifH formed a distinct cluster that branched with known Azotobacter diazotrophs. Sequence analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene showed that the ammonia-oxidizing community comprised uncultured Nitrosomonas species and Nitrosospira members affiliated with Nitrosospira cluster 3. Although nosZ genes belong to three subclasses of Proteobacteria, almost half are closely affiliated with Pseudomonas of Gammaproteobacteria. This study demonstrated that the dominant phylum in BSCs was Proteobacteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Organo-mineral complexes alter bacterial composition and induce carbon and nitrogen cycling in the rhizosphere
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - It is widely thought that organo-mineral complexes (OMCs) stabilize organic matter via mineral adsorption. Recent studies have demonstrated that root exudates can activate OMCs, but the influence of OMCs on plant rhizosphere, which is among the most active areas for microbes, has not been thoroughly researched. In this study, a pot experiment using Brassica napus was conducted to investigate the effects of OMCs on plant rhizosphere. 'I'he result showed that OMC addition significantly promoted the growth of B. napus compared to the prevalent fertilization (PF, chemical fertilizer + chicken compost) treatment. Specifically, OMC addition increased the relative abundance (RA) of nitrogenfixing bacteria and the bacterial a-diversity, and the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) group with RA > 0.5% in the OMC-treated rhizosphere was the result of a deterministic assembly process with homogeneous selection. Gene abundance related to nitrogen cycling and the soil chemical analysis demonstrated that the OMC-altered bacterial community induced nitrogen fixation and converted nitrate to ammonium. The upregulated carbon sequestration pathway genes and the increased soil microbial biomass carbon (23.68%) demonstrated that the bacterial-induced carbon storage in the rhizosphere was activated. This study shows that the addition of OMCs can influence the biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycling via regulating microorganisms in the rhizosphere. The findings provide fresh insights into the effects of OMCs on the biogeochemical cycling of important elements and suggest a promising strategy for improving soil productivity.

TI  - Nitrogen Cycling Microbial Diversity and Operational Taxonomic Unit Clustering: When to Prioritize Accuracy Over Speed
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundAssessments of the soil microbiome provide valuable insight to ecosystem function due to the integral role microorganisms play in biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients. For example, treatment effects on nitrogen cycling functional groups are often presented alongside one another to demonstrate how agricultural management practices affect various nitrogen cycling processes. However, the functional groups commonly evaluated in nitrogen cycling microbiome studies range from phylogenetically narrow (e.g., N-fixation, nitrification) to broad [e.g., denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA)]. The bioinformatics methods used in such studies were developed for 16S rRNA gene sequence data, and how these tools perform across functional genes of different phylogenetic diversity has not been established. For example, an OTU clustering method that can accurately characterize sequences harboring comparatively little diversity may not accurately resolve the diversity within a gene comprised of a large number of clades. This study uses two nitrogen cycling genes, nifH, a gene which segregates into only three distinct clades, and nrfA, a gene which is comprised of at least eighteen clades, to investigate differences which may arise when using heuristic OTU clustering (abundance-based greedy clustering, AGC) vs. true hierarchical OTU clustering (Matthews Correlation Coefficient optimizing algorithm, Opti-MCC). Detection of treatment differences for each gene were evaluated to demonstrate how conclusions drawn from a given dataset may differ depending on clustering method used. ResultsThe heuristic and hierarchical methods performed comparably for the more conserved gene, nifH. The hierarchical method outperformed the heuristic method for the more diverse gene, nrfA; this included both the ability to detect treatment differences using PERMANOVA, as well as higher resolution in taxonomic classification. The difference in performance between the two methods may be traced to the AGC method's preferential assignment of sequences to the most abundant OTUs: when analysis was limited to only the largest 100 OTUs, results from the AGC-assembled OTU table more closely resembled those of the Opti-MCC OTU table. Additionally, both AGC and Opti-MCC OTU tables detected comparable treatment differences using the rank-based ANOSIM test. This demonstrates that treatment differences were preserved using both clustering methods but were structured differently within the OTU tables produced using each method. ConclusionFor questions which can be answered using tests agnostic to clustering method (e.g., ANOSIM), or for genes of relatively low phylogenetic diversity (e.g., nifH), most upstream processing methods should lead to similar conclusions from downstream analyses. For studies involving more diverse genes, however, care should be exercised to choose methods that ensure accurate clustering for all genes. This will mitigate the risk of introducing Type II errors by allowing for detection of comparable treatment differences for all genes assessed, rather than disproportionately detecting treatment differences in only low-diversity genes.

TI  - Differential impacts of polyethylene microplastic and additives on soil nitrogen cycling: A deeper dive into microbial interactions and transformation mechanisms
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - The impact of microplastics and their additives on soil nutrient cycling, particularly through microbial mechanisms, remains underexplored. This study investigated the effects of polyethylene microplastics, polyethylene resin, and plastic additives on soil nitrogen content, physicochemical properties, nitrogen cycling functional genes, microbial composition, and nitrogen transformation rates. Results showed that all amendments increased total nitrogen but decreased dissolved total nitrogen. Polyethylene microplastics and additives increased dissolved organic nitrogen, while polyethylene resin reduced it and exhibited higher microbial biomass. Amendments reduced or did not change inorganic nitrogen levels, with additives showing the lowest values. Polyethylene resin favored microbial nitrogen immobilization, while additives were more inhibitory. Amendment type and content significantly interacted with nitrogen cycling genes and microbial composition. Distinct functional microbial biomarkers and network structures were identified for different amendments. Polyethylene microplastics had higher gross ammonification, nitrification, and immobilization rates, followed by polyethylene resin and additives. Nitrogen transformation was driven by multiple functional genes, with Proteobacteria playing a significant role. Soil physicochemical properties affected nitrogen content through transformation rates, with C/N ratio having an indirect effect and water holding capacity directly impacting it. In summary, plastic additives, compared to polyethylene microplastics and resin, are less conducive to nitrogen degradation and microbial immobilization, exert significant effects on microbial community structure, inhibit transformation rates, and ultimately impact nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Impacts of Acetochlor on Nitrogen-Cycling-Related Microbial Communities in Riparian Zone Soils
T2  - WATER
AB  - The riparian zone has a proven ability to reduce agricultural nonpoint-source nitrogen pollution. However, prior studies have only assessed nitrification and denitrification and their influencing factors, such as hydrology, climate, vegetation, and soil physicochemical properties, and overlooked the role of pesticide accumulation, which is an important nonpoint-source anthropogenic pollutant. This study investigated the response of the soil microbial nitrogen cycle in riparian zones to 60 days of acetochlor (ACE) exposure at doses of 0.5, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg. The results showed that ACE inhibited the transformation of soil NH3-N, NO3--N, and NO2--N and also decreased potential nitrification and denitrification rates by affecting the respective enzyme activities and related microbial communities. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that the expression of functional genes associated with NO3--N transformation processes, including denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and assimilatory nitrate reduction, declined the most. The recommended field dose (0.5 mg/kg) showed a slight effect on soil microbial nitrogen transformation and the related microbial communities, whereas doses 5 and 10 times the recommended dose were highly inhibitory. This is a novel study exploring the effects of ACE on the microbial nitrogen cycle in riparian soils, also suggesting that pesticide accumulation in riparian zones could affect the health of aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Herbivory changes soil microbial communities and greenhouse gas fluxes in a high-latitude wetland
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Herbivory can have strong impacts on greenhouse gas fluxes in high-latitude ecosystems. For example, in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta in western Alaska, migratory goose grazing affects the magnitude of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes. However, the underlying drivers of this relationship are unclear, as few studies systematically tease apart the processes by which herbivores influences soil biogeochemistry. To examine these mechanisms in detail, we conducted a laboratory incubation experiment to quantify changes in greenhouse gas fluxes in response to three parameters altered by herbivores in situ: temperature, soil moisture content, and nutrient inputs. These treatments were applied to soils collected in grazing lawns and nearby ungrazed habitat, allowing us to assess how variation in microbial community structure influenced observed responses. We found pronounced differences in both fungal and prokaryotic community composition between grazed and ungrazed areas. In the laboratory incubation experiment, CO2 and CH4 fluxes increased with temperature, soil moisture, and goose fecal addition, suggesting that grazing-related changes in the soil abiotic environment may enhance soil C losses. Yet, these abiotic drivers were insufficient to explain variation in fluxes between soils with and without prior grazing. Differences in trace gas fluxes between grazed and ungrazed areas may result both from herbivore-induced shifts in abiotic parameters and grazing-related alterations in microbial community structure. Our findings suggest that relationships among herbivores and soil microbial communities could mediate carbon-climate feedbacks in rapidly changing high-latitude ecosystems.

TI  - Biogeography and diversity of wetland soils bacterial communities across temperature zones based on independent studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - Wetlands are vital ecosystems that perform essential functions such as climate regulation, environmental purification, material circulation and energy flow. They play an essential role in global biogeochemical cycles, driven primarily by microorganisms. Understanding the distribution of wetland microorganisms across different temperature zones is key to comprehending their ecological roles. A meta-analysis of 704 wetland soil samples on microbial communities was conducted, using statistical methods like analysis of variance, principal component analysis, non-metric nultidimensional scaling, and structural equation modeling to examine biogeography and diversity across temperature zones. Our findings revealed a clear latitudinal diversity gradient pattern, with the highest microbial abundance in the tropics and the lowest in the southern temperate zone, which differed significantly from other temperature zones. Proteobacteria (37.76 %-51.04 %), Acidobacteria (5.11 %-30.70 %) and Bacteroidetes (3.43 %-16.16 %) dominanted the bacterial communities. Notably, the southern temperate zone showed significant variations, with a higher prevalence of Acidobacteria (30.07 %). To investigate the causes of this variability, we screened 177 core microbiome and identified latitude as the core environmental factor influencing microbial community composition. Moreover, soil microorganisms exhibited strong nitrogen cycling potentials (particularly nirD and nirB) and carbon cycling potentials (especially accA), with gene abundances showing little variation across temperature zones. Wetland bacterial communities also demonstrated high stability, with average variation degree index values ranging from 0.1 to 0.3. Our results improve the understanding of the diversity and biogeographic mechanisms of wetland bacterial communities and hold significant implications for the management and conservation of wetlands.

TI  - Increasing flow velocity promotes nitrification and denitrification in benthic biofilms via enhancing the diversity and potential predation behavior among multi-trophic microorganisms
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB  - Benthic biofilms, the aggregates of multi-trophic microorganisms, play an important role in nitrogen cycling in aquatic ecosystems and are significantly influenced by flow velocity. Nevertheless, the roles of multi-trophic microbial communities in nitrogen cycling of benthic biofilms remain unclear, especially under flow velocity conditions. In this study, we investigated how low trophic level microbial communities (bacteria, fungi, and algae), primary predator (protozoa) and secondary predator (metazoan) mediate the nitrogen cycling in benthic biofilms under low (0.05 m/s) moderate (0.1 m/s) and high (0.15 m/s) flow velocity conditions. The results showed that the activities of ammonia monooxygenase, nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase in benthic biofilms under high flow velocity increased 26.32%, 18.66%, and 10.46%, respectively, compared with those under low flow velocity. Metagenomic sequencing analysis indicated that high flow velocity enhanced the relative abundances of functional genes involved in nitrification (amoABC) and denitrification (narG, nirK, and nirS). Compared with other trophic level microorganisms, the bacterial richness had the highest explanation (42.36%) for the variation in ammonia monooxygenase, and the variations in activities of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase were explained 33.29% and 36.68% by protozoan richness, respectively. High richness index might promote nitrification and denitrification process via upregulating amino acid transport and metabolism, and signal transduction mechanisms. The negative cross trophic associations (potential predation activity) enhanced nitrification and denitrification by promoting microbial activity further enhancing ATPase activity and potential electron donor production. This study provides a new understanding of how multi-trophic microorganisms regulate the nitrogen cycling in benthic biofilms under increased flow velocity, which will benefit river management.

TI  - Large-scale experimental warming reduces soil faunal biodiversity through peatland drying
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Boreal peatlands are important ecosystems for carbon cycling because they store 1/3 of the world's terrestrial carbon in only similar to 3% of the global landmass. This high carbon storage capacity makes them a key potential mitigation strategy for increased carbon emissions induced by global climate warming. In high-carbon storage systems like peatlands, soil faunal communities are responsible for secondary decomposition of organic matter and nutrient cycling, which suggests they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Experiments have shown that warming can affect plant and microbial communities in ways that potentially shift peatlands from carbon sinks to sources. Although previous studies have found variable effects of climate change manipulations on soil communities, warming is expected to affect soil community composition mainly through reductions in moisture content, whereas elevated CO2 atmospheric concentrations are expected to only indirectly and weakly do so. In this study we used a large-scale peatland field-based experiment to test how soil microarthropod (oribatid and mesostigmatid mite, and collembolan species abundance, richness and community composition) respond to a range of experimental warming temperatures (between 0 degrees C and +9 degrees C) crossed with elevated CO2 conditions over 4 years in the Spruce and Peatland Responses Under Changing Environments (SPRUCE) experiment. Here we found that warming significantly decreased surface peat moisture, which in turn decreased species microarthropod richness and abundance. Specifically, oribatid and mesostigmatid mite, collembolan, and overall microarthropod richness significantly decreased under lower moisture levels. Also, the abundance of microarthropods increased under higher moisture levels. Neither warming nor elevated [CO2] affected microarthropods when analysed together or separate, except for the richness of mesostigmatids that significantly increased under warming. At the community level, communities varied significantly over time (except collembolans), and moisture was an important driver explaining community species composition. While we expect that the cumulative and interactive effects of the SPRUCE experimental treatments on soil faunal biodiversity will continue to emerge, our results already suggest effects are becoming more observable over time. Taken together, the changes belowground indicate potential changes on carbon and nitrogen cycles, as microarthropods are important players of soil food webs.

TI  - Fungal community diversity and their contribution to nitrogen cycling in in-situ aerated landfills: Insights from field and laboratory studies
T2  - WASTE MANAGEMENT
AB  - The application of in-situ aeration technology in landfills has been reported to promote fungal growth, but the community diversity and function of fungi in the aerated landfill system remain unknown. This study firstly investigated an in-situ aerated remediation landfill site to characterize the fungal community diversity in refuse. And to further reveal the fungal involvement in the nitrogen cycling system, laboratory-scale simulated aerated landfill reactors were then constructed. The results in the aerated landfill site showed a significant correlation between fungal community structure and ammonia nitrogen content in the refuse. Dominant fungi in the fungal community included commonly found environmental fungi such as Fusarium, Aspergillus, Gibberella, as well as unique fungi in the aerated system like Chaetomium. In the laboratory-scale aerated landfill simulation experiments, the fungal system was constructed using bacterial inhibitor, and nitrogen balance analysis confirmed the significant role of fungal nitrification in the nitrogen cycling process. When ammonia nitrogen was not readily available, fungi converted organic nitrogen to nitrate, serving as the main nitrification mechanism in the system, with a contribution rate ranging from 62.71 % to 100 % of total nitrification. However, when ammonia nitrogen was present in the system, autotrophic nitrification became the main mechanism, and the contribution of fungal nitrification to total nitrification was only 15.96 %. Additionally, fungi were capable of directly utilizing nitrite for nitrate production with a rate of 4.65 mg L-1 d-1. This research article contributes to the understanding of the importance of fungi in the aerated landfill systems, filling a gap in knowledge.

TI  - A meta-analysis of 1,119 manipulative experiments on terrestrial carbon-cycling responses to global change
T2  - NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION
AB  - Direct quantification of terrestrial biosphere responses to global change is crucial for projections of future climate change in Earth system models. Here, we synthesized ecosystem carbon-cycling data from 1,119 experiments performed over the past four decades concerning changes in temperature, precipitation, CO2 and nitrogen across major terrestrial vegetation types of the world. Most experiments manipulated single rather than multiple global change drivers in temperate ecosystems of the USA, Europe and China. The magnitudes of warming and elevated CO2 treatments were consistent with the ranges of future projections, whereas those of precipitation changes and nitrogen inputs often exceeded the projected ranges. Increases in global change drivers consistently accelerated, but decreased precipitation slowed down carbon-cycle processes. Nonlinear (including synergistic and antagonistic) effects among global change drivers were rare. Belowground carbon allocation responded negatively to increased precipitation and nitrogen addition and positively to decreased precipitation and elevated CO2. The sensitivities of carbon variables to multiple global change drivers depended on the background climate and ecosystem condition, suggesting that Earth system models should be evaluated using site-specific conditions for best uses of this large dataset. Together, this synthesis underscores an urgent need to explore the interactions among multiple global change drivers in under-represented regions such as semi-arid ecosystems, forests in the tropics and subtropics, and Arctic tundra when forecasting future terrestrial carbon-climate feedback.

TI  - A holistic assessment of greenhouse gas dynamics from forests to the effects of wood products use in Austria
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
AB  - Anthropogenic GHG emissions add a fast reinforcing feedback cycle to global carbon dynamics which continues to influence GHG concentrations in the Earth's atmosphere. When looking at forest carbon cycles there is potential in utilizing another feedback cycle, namely the carbon cycle involving harvested wood products. To assess the potential of the mitigation options arising from these carbon flows, the forest-based sector in Austria was modelled to assess causal links, dependencies and dynamics involved in GHG-relevant processes. Carbon dynamics were investigated in forests and forest soil carbon, the forest product chain and life-cycle analyses for substitution of conventional products with wood products in a cascade of different modelling approaches and paradigms, and the results synthesized. It was found that material use of products from domestic timber sources has the highest climate change mitigation efficiency when originating from sustainably managed forests regarding biomass stocks. The emissions saved through building up a carbon stock from harvested wood products and through emissions substitution can be as high as similar to 20 years of total annual Austrian emissions in 90 years. Additional conservation measures while sustaining sawnwood production and the related GHG benefits at a high level had the highest contribution to an overall carbon sink.

TI  - The Rhizosphere Responds: Rich Fen Peat and Root Microbial Ecology after Long-Term Water Table Manipulation
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Hydrologic shifts due to climate change will affect the cycling of carbon (C) stored in boreal peatlands. Carbon cycling in these systems is carried out by microorganisms and plants in close association. This study investigated the effects of experimentally manipulated water tables (lowered and raised) and plant functional groups on the peat and root microbiomes in a boreal rich fen. All samples were sequenced and processed for bacterial, archaeal (16S DNA genes; V4), and fungal (internal transcribed spacer 2 [ITS2]) DNA. Depth had a strong effect on microbial and fungal communities across all water table treatments. Bacterial and archaeal communities were most sensitive to the water table treatments, particularly at the 10- to 20-cm depth; this area coincides with the rhizosphere or rooting zone. Iron cyclers, particularly members of the family Geobacteraceae, were enriched around the roots of sedges, horsetails, and grasses. The fungal community was affected largely by plant functional group, especially cinquefoils. Fungal endophytes (particularly Acephala spp.) were enriched in sedge and grass roots, which may have underappreciated implications for organic matter breakdown and cycling. Fungal lignocellulose degraders were enriched in the lowered water table treatment. Our results were indicative of two main methanogen communities, a rooting zone community dominated by the archaeal family Methanobacteriaceae and a deep peat community dominated by the family Methanomicrobiaceae.
   IMPORTANCE This study demonstrated that roots and the rooting zone in boreal fens support organisms likely capable of methanogenesis, iron cycling, and fungal endophytic association and are directly or indirectly affecting carbon cycling in these ecosystems. These taxa, which react to changes in the water table and associate with roots and, particularly, graminoids, may gain greater biogeochemical influence, as projected higher precipitation rates could lead to an increased abundance of sedges and grasses in boreal fens.

TI  - Edge effects increase soil respiration without altering soil carbon stocks in temperate broadleaf forests
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbance has left the world's forests highly fragmented, with a significant proportion of edge-affected area. Abiotic changes at forest edges are likely to affect forest soil carbon cycling, as higher temperatures and lower moisture availability in edge environments have well-documented effects on soil respiration. The present study sought to quantify persistent changes in soil carbon cycling in the fragmented broadleaf forests of southeastern Pennsylvania. At three sites with >80-year-old forest-field edges, three 100-m transects perpendicular to the edge were established. Monthly measurements of soil respiration, temperature, and moisture were made at fixed distances along each transect throughout the growing season. Soil carbon storage from 0 to 20 cm depth, litter biomass, and decomposition rates were also assessed. Soil respiration was significantly higher at forest edges, relative to the interior, and this effect penetrated 60 m into the forest. Significantly elevated surface soil temperature and decreased soil moisture were also observed in edge environments. Despite elevated soil respiration at the edge, soil carbon storage, litter biomass, and decomposition rates were invariant along edge to interior gradients. The temperature responsiveness of soil respiration was significantly higher in the forest interior (100 m), relative to locations <= 60 m from the edge. Edge effects altering elements of the soil carbon cycle were apparent in the forests of southeastern Pennsylvania, and principally manifest as increased soil respiration rates and decreased temperature responsiveness of soil respiration. Lack of variation in soil carbon pools and decomposition rates from the forest edge to interior suggests that increased soil respiration may be related to changes in root and rhizosphere respiration at the edge. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence documenting increased soil respiration in the edge environments of temperate broadleaf forests. Discounting the alterations imposed by forest fragmentation on carbon cycling has the potential to produce misleading estimates of land-atmosphere CO2 exchange and terrestrial carbon storage.

TI  - Inhibition of high sulfur on functional microorganisms and genes in slightly contaminated soil by cadmium and chromium
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - It is generally accepted that sulfur can passivate the bioavailability of heavy metals in soil, but it is not clear whether high sulfur in cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) contaminated soil has negative effect on soil microbial community and ecological function. In this study, total sulfur (TS) inhibited the Chao 1, Shannon, Phylogenetic diversity (Pd) of bacterial and Pd of fungi in slightly contaminated soil by Cd and Cr around pyrite. TS, total potassium, pH, total chromium, total cadmium, total nitrogen, soil organic matter were the predominant factors for soil microbial community; the contribution of TS in shaping bacterial and fungal communities ranked at first and fifth, respectively. Compared with the low sulfur group, the abundance of sulfur sensitive microorganisms Gemmatimonas, Pseudolabrys, MND1, and Schizothecium were decreased by 68.79-97.22% (p < 0.01) at high sulfur one; the carbon fixation, nitrogen cycling, phosphorus cycling and resistance genes abundance were significantly lower (p < 0.01) at the latter. Such variations were strongly and closely correlated to the suppression of energy metabolism (M00009, M00011, M00086) and carbon fixation (M00173, M00376) functional module genes abundance in the high sulfur group. Collectively, high sulfur significantly suppressed the abundances of functional microorganisms and functional genes in slightly contaminated soil with Cd and Cr, possibly through inhibition of energy metabolism and carbon fixation of functional microorganisms. This study provided new insights into the environmental behavior of sulfur in slightly contaminated soil with Cd and Cr.

TI  - Responses of bacterial community and functional marker genes of nitrogen cycling to biochar, compost and combined amendments in soil
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Biochar and compost are seen as two attractive waste management options and are used for soil amendment and pollution remediation. The interaction between biochar and composting may improve the potential benefits of biochar and compost. We investigated soil physicochemical properties, bacterial community, bacterial 16S rRNA, and functional marker genes of nitrogen cycling of the soil remedied with nothing (S), compost (SC), biochar (SB), a mixture of compost and biochar (SBC), composted biochar (SBced), and a composted mixture of biochar and biomass (SBCing). The results were that all amendments (1) increased the bacterial community richness (except SB) and SBCing showed the greatest efficiency; (2) increased the bacterial community diversity (SBCing > SBC > SC > SBced > SB > S); and (3) changed the gene copy numbers of 16S rRNA, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes of bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). All amendments (except SB) could increase the gene copy number of 16S rRNA, and SBCing had the greatest efficiency. The changes of soil bacterial community richness and diversity and the gene copy numbers of 16S rRNA, nirK, nirS, nosZ, AOA, and AOB would affect carbon and nitrogen cycling of the ecosystem and also implied that BCing had the greatest efficiency on soil amendment.

TI  - Biochar superior than straw in enhancing soil carbon sequestration via altering organic matter stability and carbon cycle genes in Cd-Contaminated soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Organic amendments can effectively improve soil organic matter (SOM) contents while mitigating Cd bioavailability. However, the interplay between soil carbon functional microbe and SOM stability response to straw and its biochar amendment in Cd contaminated soil remains poorly understood. Therefore, to reveal the interaction of SOM stability moieties with soil carbon cycle genes under Cd pressure, the effects of straw and its biochar on SOM stabilities in aggregates and soil carbon cycle related genes were evaluated. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and two-dimensional correlation FTIR spectroscopy were employed to appraise the stability of SOM within aggregates. Results showed that biochar reduced while straw promoted soil DTPA-Cd content by 9.4 %-21.9 % and 21.9 %-25.0 %, respectively. Straw return improved the relative abundance of aliphatic carbon and polysaccharides carbon but biochar mainly elevates the proportion of aromatic carbon, especially in 0.25-0.053 mm aggregates. The ratio of aromatic carbon to aliphatic carbon in biochar-amended soil was higher than that in control and straw-amended soil, indicating biochar outperforms straw in enhancing SOM stability. Biochar and straw application promoted the abundance of carbon degradation genes by 2.8 %-5.4 % but reduced the abundance of carbon sequestration genes by 1.1 %-4.6 %. Biochar enhanced the carbon degradation genes related to aromatics (xynA, alkB, aceB, and vdh) and chitin (chbG and cpbD) degradation while straw improved the genes participating in cellulose (endoglucanase, bglB, and bglX) and hemicellulose (xynB, abfA, and xylA) degradation. Mantel test showed that the alterations of soil carbon cycle are closely related to DTPA-Cd contents and SOM stability. Overall, biochar holds considerable potential than straw in enhancing soil carbon sequestration potential in Cd-contaminated soil.

TI  - The impact of global change factors on the functional genes of soil nitrogen and methane cycles in grassland ecosystems: a meta-analysis
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Soil functional genes in grasslands are crucial for processes like nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, methane production, and oxidation, integral to nitrogen and methane cycles. However, the impact of global changes on these genes is not well understood. We reviewed 84 studies to examine the effects of nitrogen addition (N), warming (W), increased precipitation (PPT +), decreased precipitation (PPT-), and elevated CO2 (eCO2) on these functional genes. For nitrogen cycling, global changes mainly boost genes involved in nitrification but reduce those in denitrification, with nirK being the most sensitive. Most nitrogen fixation-related genes did not show a significant response. Among single factors, N and PPT + have the most significant effects. The impact of global changes on nitrogen cycling genes is largely additive, and their interaction with N is particularly influential. For methane cycling, global changes notably affect mcrA, while only PPT + significantly reduces pmoA. The magnitude and duration of global change treatments are more critical than the treatment form for nitrogen cycling genes. For methane cycling, the form and intensity of nitrogen addition, along with treatment duration, affect pmoA abundance. We also identified a competitive relationship between methane oxidation and nitrification and a complex coupling with denitrification. This study provides new insights into microbial responses in nitrogen and methane cycling under global changes, with significant implications for experimental design and management strategies in grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Interspecific Plant Interactions Reflected in Soil Bacterial Community Structure and Nitrogen Cycling in Primary Succession
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Past research demonstrating the importance plant-microbe interactions as drivers of ecosystem succession has focused on how plants condition soil microbial communities, impacting subsequent plant performance and plant community assembly. These studies, however, largely treat microbial communities as a black box. In this study, we sought to examine how emblematic shifts from early successional Alnus viridus ssp. sinuata (Sitka alder) to late successional Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) in primary succession may be reflected in specific belowground changes in bacterial community structure and nitrogen cycling related to the interaction of these two plants. We examined early successional alder-conditioned soils in a glacial forefield to delineate how alders alter the soil microbial community with increasing dominance. Further, we assessed the impact of late-successional spruce plants on these early successional alder-conditioned microbiomes and related nitrogen cycling through a leachate addition microcosm experiment. We show how increasingly abundant alder select for particular bacterial taxa. Additionally, we found that spruce leachate significantly alters the composition of these microbial communities in large part by driving declines in taxa that are enriched by alder, including bacterial symbionts. We found these effects to be spruce specific, beyond a general leachate effect. Our work also demonstrates a unique influence of spruce on ammonium availability. Such insights bolster theory relating the importance of plant-microbe interactions with late-successional plants and interspecific plant interactions more generally.

TI  - The decomposition of ectomycorrhizal fungal necromass
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The turnover of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal biomass represents a significant input into forest carbon (C) and nutrient cycles. Given the size of these fluxes, understanding the factors that control the decomposition of this necromass will greatly improve understanding of C and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. Recent research has highlighted the considerable variation in the decomposition rates of EM fungal necromass, and patterns from this research are beginning to emerge. In this article we review the research that has examined both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that control the decomposition of EM fungal necromass and propose additional factors that may strongly influence EM fungal necromass decomposition and ecosystem properties. We argue that, as with most plant litters, the stoichiometry (C:N) of EM necromass is an important factor governing decomposition, but its role is modulated by the nature of the C and N in the tissue. In particular, melanin concentration appears to negatively influence the quality of EM fungal necromass much as lignin does in plant litters. Other intrinsic factors such as the morphology of the mycelium may also play a large role and suggest this as a focus for future research. Extrinsic factors, such as decomposer community activity and physical protection by soil, are also likely to be important in governing the decomposition of ectomycorrhizal necromass in situ. Finally, we highlight the potential importance of EM fungal necromass diversity and abundance in influencing terrestrial biogeochemical cycles. Understanding the factors that control the decomposition of EM necromass will then improve the predictive power of next-generation terrestrial biosphere models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Tidal variation and litter decomposition co-affect carbon emissions in estuarine wetlands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Estuarine wetlands play important roles in the regional and global carbon cycle as well as greenhouse gas emissions; however, the driving factors and potential carbon emissions mechanisms are unclear. Here, the carbon emission fluxes were investigated in situ from different vegetated areas in the Chongming wetlands. The results showed that the highest methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of 178.1 and 21,482.5 mg.m(-2).min(-1) were in Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis dominated areas, respectively. A series of microcosms was strategically designed to simulate the influence of tidal variation on carbon emissions and the litter decomposition on daily- and monthlytimescales in estuarine wetlands. All added litter promoted CH4 and CO2 emissions from the wetland soils. The CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes of the S. mariqueter treatment were higher (367.7 vs. 108.4; 1607.9 vs. 1324.3 mg.m(-2).min(-1)) than those of the P. australis treatment without tidal variation on a monthly timescale, due to the higher total organic carbon (TOC) content of S. mariqueter. The decomposition of litter also released a large amount of nutrients, which enhanced the abundance of methane-producing archaea (MPA) and methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB). However, the tidal water level was negatively correlated with CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes. The CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes in the S. mariqueter treatment at the lowest tide were 556.02 and 604.99 mg.m(-2).min(-1), respectively. However, the CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes did not change significantly on the daily timescale in the S. mariqueter treatment without tidal variations. Therefore, the prolonged timescales revealed increases in litter decomposition but a decrease in the contribution of tidal variations to carbon emissions in estuarine wetlands. These findings provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the carbon cycle in estuarine wetlands.

TI  - Multiple, Compounding Disturbances in a Forest Ecosystem: Fire Increases Susceptibility of Soil Edaphic Properties, Bacterial Community Structure, and Function to Change with Extreme Precipitation Event
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
AB  - The intensity and frequency of ecosystem disturbances are shifting with climate change, and multiple disturbances in close succession have the potential to compound their independent effects and strongly alter ecosystem structure and function. In this paper, we examine the effects of an extreme precipitation event on a montane forest landscape that was previously decimated by wildfire (37 months prior) relative to an unburned site in the same ecosystem. We assessed responses in soil edaphic properties, bacterial community composition and assembly, and soil enzyme activities involved in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) acquisition. Our research reveals that previously burned landscapes are susceptible to a subsequent extreme precipitation event via significant increases in soil pH where unburned soils are not. Beta- and Delta-proteobacteria associated with early succession increased and shifts were observed in N- vs. C-acquiring extracellular enzymes within burned soils after the extreme precipitation event. Finally, we connected variation in ecological selective pressures on bacterial communities associated with pH change to these differences in microbial mediated soil enzyme activity. Thus, this research demonstrates how multiple, compounding disturbances drive distinct changes relative to systems experiencing a single disturbance and suggests that changes in bacterial community assembly process with disturbance may underlie this response.

TI  - Dead or alive: carbon as a currency to integrate disease and ecosystem ecology theory
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Death is a common outcome of infection, but most disease models do not track hosts after death. Instead, these hosts disappear into a void. This assumption lacks critical realism, because dead hosts can alter host-pathogen dynamics. Here, we develop a theoretical framework of carbon-based models combining disease and ecosystem perspectives to investigate the consequences of feedbacks between living and dead hosts on disease dynamics and carbon cycling. Because autotrophs (i.e. plants and phytoplankton) are critical regulators of carbon cycling, we developed general model structures and parameter combinations to broadly reflect disease of autotrophic hosts across ecosystems. Analytical model solutions highlight the importance of disease-ecosystem coupling. For example, decomposition rates of dead hosts mediate pathogen spread, and carbon flux between live and dead biomass pools are sensitive to pathogen effects on host growth and death rates. Variation in dynamics arising from biologically realistic parameter combinations largely fell along a single gradient from slow to fast carbon turnover rates, and models predicted higher disease impacts in fast turnover systems (e.g. lakes and oceans) than slow turnover systems (e.g. boreal forests). Our results demonstrate that a unified framework, including the effects of pathogens on carbon cycling, provides novel hypotheses and insights at the nexus of disease and ecosystem ecology.

TI  - Global Atlas of Methane Metabolism Marker Genes in Soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Methane, a greenhouse gas, plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle, influencing the Earth's climate. Only a limited number of microorganisms control the flux of biologically produced methane in nature, including methane-oxidizing bacteria, anaerobic methanotrophic archaea, and methanogenic archaea. Although previous studies have revealed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of methane-metabolizing microorganisms in local regions by using the marker genes pmoA or mcrA, their biogeographical patterns and environmental drivers remain largely unknown at a global scale. Here, we used 3419 metagenomes generated from georeferenced soil samples to examine the global patterns of methane metabolism marker gene abundances in soil, which generally represent the global distribution of methane-metabolizing microorganisms. The resulting maps revealed notable latitudinal trends in the abundances of methane-metabolizing microorganisms across global soils, with higher abundances in the sub-Arctic, sub-Antarctic, and tropical rainforest regions than in temperate regions. The variations in global abundances of methane-metabolizing microorganisms were primarily governed by vegetation cover. Our high-resolution global maps of methane-metabolizing microorganisms will provide valuable information for the prediction of biogenic methane emissions under current and future climate scenarios.

In this chapter, we review the state- of- art understanding on the research filed of Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems. Significant progresses have been achieved in such aspects as model simulations of vegetation dynamics, the macro-scale mechanism underlying biodiversity maintenance, and carbon cycling over the last 15 years. The future research requires better understanding on complex mechanisms of ecosystem dynamics, in order to project their future evolution, which is essential to design the adaptation strategies.

TI  - The Microbiome of Brazilian Mangrove Sediments as Revealed by Metagenomics
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Here we embark in a deep metagenomic survey that revealed the taxonomic and potential metabolic pathways aspects of mangrove sediment microbiology. The extraction of DNA from sediment samples and the direct application of pyrosequencing resulted in approximately 215 Mb of data from four distinct mangrove areas (BrMgv01 to 04) in Brazil. The taxonomic approaches applied revealed the dominance of Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria in the samples. Paired statistical analysis showed higher proportions of specific taxonomic groups in each dataset. The metabolic reconstruction indicated the possible occurrence of processes modulated by the prevailing conditions found in mangrove sediments. In terms of carbon cycling, the sequences indicated the prevalence of genes involved in the metabolism of methane, formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide. With respect to the nitrogen cycle, evidence for sequences associated with dissimilatory reduction of nitrate, nitrogen immobilization, and denitrification was detected. Sequences related to the production of adenylsulfate, sulfite, and H2S were relevant to the sulphur cycle. These data indicate that the microbial core involved in methane, nitrogen, and sulphur metabolism consists mainly of Burkholderiaceae, Planctomycetaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Desulfobacteraceae. Comparison of our data to datasets from soil and sea samples resulted in the allotment of the mangrove sediments between those samples. The results of this study add valuable data about the composition of microbial communities in mangroves and also shed light on possible transformations promoted by microbial organisms in mangrove sediments.

TI  - Effects of C and N application on Azotobacter and nitrogen cycle in farmland soils of central Guizhou, China
T2  - CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Carbon sources and nitrogen sources are two important groups of substances in analyses of the effects of exogenous additives on soil microorganisms. Glucose (present in soil) and urea (extensively used in agricultural production) are substances often used to study the specific effects of carbon and nitrogen addition on microorganisms. Azotobacter, a non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium, has been characterized in the laboratory and applied to soil in numerous studies. However, soil microorganisms display considerable diversity, and the effects of in exogenous substances stimulation on various microorganisms are uncertain. The potential effects of forced exogenous substance stimulation on Azotobacter are not well understood. Here, the effects of C and N application on Azotobacter growth and nitrogen cycle metabolism in farmland soil in central Guizhou, China, were studied through analysis of four treatment groups: control (CK), glucose treatment (C), urea treatment (N), and glucose + urea treatment (CN). The results showed that the relative abundances of the Azotobacter genus and relevant species were increased in group C, indicating promotion of Azotobacter growth (P < 0.001). The relative abundances of the Azotobacter genus and relevant species in group CN were significantly different from the abundances in group N and CK (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the relative abundances of nif genes (i.e., nifH, nifD, and nifK) and nirD were significantly increased in group C. However, the relative abundances of the aforementioned four nitrogen cycle-related genes did not significantly differ between group CN and groups CK and N. The main source species of the aforementioned four nitrogen cycle-related genes were Azotobacter species. The total nitrogen and alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen contents in soil did not significantly differ in a comparison between group C and groups N and CN. Piecewise structural equation modeling analysis revealed that bacterial alpha-diversity, Azotobacter, and nitrogen cycle genes had significant direct effects on the alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen content in soil and had negligible direct effects on the total nitrogen content in soil. These findings improve the broader understanding of Azotobacter and provide theoretical support for reduced Azotobacter utilization in soil.

TI  - Loss in microbial diversity affects nitrogen cycling in soil
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Microbial communities have a central role in ecosystem processes by driving the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. However, the importance of microbial diversity for ecosystem functioning is still debated. Here, we experimentally manipulated the soil microbial community using a dilution approach to analyze the functional consequences of diversity loss. A trait-centered approach was embraced using the denitrifiers as model guild due to their role in nitrogen cycling, a major ecosystem service. How various diversity metrics related to richness, eveness and phylogenetic diversity of the soil denitrifier community were affected by the removal experiment was assessed by 454 sequencing. As expected, the diversity metrics indicated a decrease in diversity in the 1/10(3) and 1/10(5) dilution treatments compared with the undiluted one. However, the extent of dilution and the corresponding reduction in diversity were not commensurate, as a dilution of five orders of magnitude resulted in a 75% decrease in estimated richness. This reduction in denitrifier diversity resulted in a significantly lower potential denitrification activity in soil of up to 4-5 folds. Addition of wheat residues significantly increased differences in potential denitrification between diversity levels, indicating that the resource level can influence the shape of the microbial diversity-functioning relationship. This study shows that microbial diversity loss can alter terrestrial ecosystem processes, which suggests that the importance of functional redundancy in soil microbial communities has been overstated.

TI  - Ecological network analysis reveals the inter-connection between soil biodiversity and ecosystem function as affected by land use across Europe
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil organisms are considered drivers of soil ecosystem services (primary productivity, nutrient cycling, carbon cycling, water regulation) associated with sustainable agricultural production. Soil biodiversity was highlighted in the soil thematic strategy as a key component of soil quality. The lack of quantitative standardised data at a large scale has resulted in poor understanding of how soil biodiversity could be incorporated into legislation for the protection of soil quality. In 2011, the EcoFINDERS (FP7) project sampled 76 sites across 11 European countries, covering five biogeographical zones (Alpine, Atlantic, Boreal, Continental and Mediterranean) and three land-uses (arable, grass, forestry). Samples collected from across these sites ranged in soil properties; soil organic carbon (SOC), pH and texture. To assess the range in biodiversity and ecosystem function across the sites, fourteen biological methods were applied as proxy indicators for these functions. These methods measured the following: microbial diversity: DNA yields (molecular biomass), archaea, bacteria, total fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; micro fauna diversity: nematode trophic groups; meso fauna diversity: enchytraeids and Collembola species; microbial function: nitrification, extracellular enzymes, multiple substrate induced respiration, community level physiological profiling and ammonia oxidiser/nitrification functional genes. Network analysis was used to identify the key connections between organisms under the different land use scenarios. Highest network density was found in forest soils and lowest density occurred in arable soils. Key taxomonic units (TUs) were identified in each land-use type and in relation to SOC and pH categorisations. Top-connected taxonomic units (i.e. displaying the most co-occurrence to other TUs) were identified for each land use type. In arable sites this was dominated by bacteria and fungi, while in grassland sites bacteria and fungi were most connected. In forest soils archaeal, enchytraeid and fungal TUs displayed the largest number of neighbours, reflecting the greatest connectivity. Multiple regression models were applied to assess the potential contribution of soil organisms to carbon cycling and storage and nutrient cycling of specifically nitrogen and phosphorus. Key drivers of carbon cycling were microbial biomass, basal respiration and fungal richness; these three measures have often been associated with carbon cycling in soils. Regression models of nutrient cycling were dependent on the model applied, showing variation in biological indicators. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Biodegradable microplastics (MPs) are proposed as sustainable alternatives to conventional MPs, yet their distinct effects on soil microbial communities and ecological functions remain insufficiently understood. This study compares the impacts of biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) and conventional polyvinyl chloride (PVC) MPs on soil microbial assemblages and nitrogen cycling. Fluorescein diacetate hydrolase (FDAse) activity was temporarily stimulated by 2 % (w/w) PLA and PVC MPs, while 7 % (w/w) PVC MPs initially inhibited FDAse activity before promoting it. PLA MPs (2 % and 7 %, w/w) dramatically reduced bacterial diversity and altered community structure, enriching genera such as Nocardioides, Arthrobacter, Agromyces, Amycolatopsis, Saccharothrix, and Ramlibacter, known for degrading complex compounds. Conversely, PVC MPs (2 % and 7 %, w/w) showed minimal influence on bacterial diversity, with only temporary structural shifts at high concentrations (7 % w/w). Network analysis revealed greater microbial complexity with PLA MPs, where MPs-degrading taxa emerged as keystone species. PLA MPs at both concentrations notably increased the abundance of nitrogenase iron protein subunit H gene (nifH) and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Bradyrhizobium, while also sustaining ammonia monooxygenase subunit A gene (AOB amoA) effects up to day 90. At higher doses (7 % w/w), PLA MPs enriched copper-containing nitrite reductase gene (nirK) and cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase gene (nirS) abundance, boosting denitrifiers like Cupriavidus, Pseudarthrobacter, and Ensifer. In contrast, PVC MPs showed short-term effects on nitrogen cycling function. These findings have important implications for promoting sustainable agriculture and managing the environmental risks posed by MPs in soil ecosystems.

TI  - Soil microbial nitrogen-cycling gene abundances in response to crop diversification: A meta-analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Single planting structure has a significant impact on the maintenance of nitrogen in managed ecosystems. Although the effect of crop diversity on soil nitrogen-cycling microbes is mainly related to the influence of environmental factors, there is a lack of quantitative research. This study aims to determine the effect of diversified cropping mode on the abundance of functional genes in the soil nitrogen cycle based on the quantitative integration of a meta-analysis database containing 189 observation data pairs. The results show that the soil nifH (nitrogenase coding gene), nirS and nirK (nitrite reductase coding gene), and narG (nitrate reductase coding gene) abundances are positively affected by the diversity of plant species, whereas the amoA (ammonia monooxygenase coding gene) and nosZ (nitrous oxide reductase coding gene) show no response. Diversification duration and ecosystem type are important factors that regulate soil nitrogen fixation and nitrification gene abundances. Denitrification genes are mainly affected by categorical variables such as the planting pattern, soil layer, application species, duration, and soil texture. Among them, the long-term continuous diversification is mainly manifested in the reduction of soil nifH and increase of nirK abundances. Soil organic carbon and nitrogen linearly affect the responses of nifH, amoA, nirS, and nirK. Therefore, to maintain the soil ecological function, diversity of planting patterns needs to be applied flexibly by regulating the abundance of nitrogen cycling genes. Our study draws conclusions in order to provide theoretical references for the sustainability of nitrogen and improvement of management measures in the process of terrestrial managed ecosystem diversification.

TI  - Manure input propagated antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in soils by regulating microbial carbon metabolism
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) in soils represent a significant threat to ecological security and human health. The carbon-rich soil formed by manure fertilization provides an energy source for soil microbes. However, we still know little about how microbial-dominated carbon metabolism affects ARGs and VFs proliferation in soils subjected to long-term fertilization and irrigation practices in wheat-maize system. Here, we investigated soil microbial carbon metabolism, ARGs and VFs distribution, and microbial composition in soils under 9-year of different fertilization and irrigation managements during wheat growing period. Results showed that manure (M) increased total abundance of soil ARGs by 5.9 %-8.0 % and 2.1 %-4.8 % and VFs by 5.4 %-7.5 % and 2.0 %-4.9 % compared to no fertilizer (CK) and NPK fertilizer (C), respectively, regardless of irrigation. M enriched more number of ARGs and VFs types, and increased abundance of host microbes involved in carbon fixation and carbon degradation, such as Streptomyces, Lysobacter and Agromyces. M increased abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and carbon cycle functional pathways, as well as microbial carbon metabolism capacity. Partial least squares path modeling and correlation analysis showed that microbial diversity, CAZymes, carbon cycle functional pathways (particularly carbon fixation and degradation) and microbial carbon metabolism capacity of microbial community had direct positive effects on the proliferation and spread of ARGs and VFs. In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of microbial mediated carbon metabolism in driving the dissemination of ARGs and VFs in soils under long-term manure application.

TI  - Indirect regulation of topsoil nutrient cycling by groundwater depth: impacts on sand-fixing vegetation and rhizosphere bacterial communities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Methods: We investigated the impacts of plant growth and soil physicochemical factors on rhizosphere bacterial communities under different GTD.Results: The four plant growth indices (Pielou, Margalef, Simpson, and Shannon-Wiener indices) and soil water content (SWC) at the Artem and Salix sites all showed a decreasing trend with increasing GTD. Salix had a higher nutrient content than Artem. The response of plant rhizosphere bacterial communities to GTD changes were as follows. Rhizosphere bacteria at the Artem and Salix sites exhibited higher relative abundance and alpha diversity in SW (GTD < 5 m) compared than in DW (GTD > 5 m). Functional microbial predictions indicated that the rhizosphere bacterial communities of Artem and Salix promoted carbon metabolism in the SW. In contrast, Artem facilitated nitrogen cycling, whereas Salix enhanced both nitrogen cycling and phototrophic metabolism in the DW.Discussion: Mantel test analysis revealed that in the SW of Artem sites, SWC primarily governed the diversity of rhizosphere and functional bacteria involved in the nitrogen cycle by affecting plant growth. In DW, functional bacteria increase soil organic carbon (SOC) to meet nutrient demands. However, higher carbon and nitrogen availability in the rhizosphere soil was observed in the SW of the Salix sites, whereas in DW, carbon nutrient availability correlated with keystone bacteria, and changes in nitrogen content could be attributed to nitrogen mineralization. This indicates that fluctuations in the groundwater table play a role in regulating microbes and the distribution of soil carbon and nitrogen nutrients in arid environments.

TI  - Intercropping improves the complexity of cross-kingdom networks between bacterial and fungal communities associated with soil carbon cycling in Hainan island of China
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) intercropped with areca palm (Areca catechu L.) represents the main composite planting pattern for black pepper production in Hainan Province, China. This intercropping system can enhance black pepper yield by altering soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities. However, the mechanisms by which microorganisms influence soil nutrient cycling and the changes in soil microbial communities-particularly cross-kingdom networks linking bacteria and fungi-remain largely unknown. Here, we comprehensively examined soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activities, microbial communities, and cross-kingdom networks of bacteria and fungi. Intercropping strengthened the relationships between soil nutrients and enzyme activities and promoted soil carbon cycling by increasing beta-glucosidase activity, primarily driven by bacterial functions in carbon metabolism. Bacterial diversity responded more strongly to intercropping than fungal diversity. Moreover, this practice substantially increased the complexity of microbial co-occurrence networks in both bacterial and fungal communities. Intercropping also enhanced the interconnections between abiotic and biotic factors, particularly increasing the complexity and stability of cross-kingdom microbial networks.

TI  - Rhizosphere melatonin application reprograms nitrogen-cycling related microorganisms to modulate low temperature response in barley
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Rhizospheric melatonin application has a positive effect on the tolerance of plants to low temperature; however, it remains unknown whether the rhizosphere microorganisms are involved in this process. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exogenous melatonin on the diversity and functioning of fungi and bacteria in rhizosphere of barley under low temperature. The results showed that rhizospheric melatonin application positively regulated the photosynthetic carbon assimilation and redox homeostasis in barley in response to low temperature. These effects might be associated with an altered diversity of microbial community in rhizosphere, especially the species and relative abundance of nitrogen cycling related microorganisms, as exemplified by the changes in rhizosphere metabolites in the pathways of amino acid synthesis and metabolism. Collectively, it was suggested that the altered rhizospheric microbial status upon melatonin application was associated with the response of barley to low temperature. This suggested that the melatonin induced microbial changes should be considered for its application in the crop cold-resistant cultivation.

TI  - Nitrogen restrictions buffer modeled interactions of water with the carbon cycle
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Terrestrial carbon and water cycles are coupled at multiple spatiotemporal scales and are crucial to carbon sequestration. Water related climate extremes, such as drought and intense precipitation, can substantially affect the carbon cycle. Meanwhile, nitrogen is a limiting resource to plant and has therefore the potential to alter the coupling of water and carbon cycles on land. Here we assess the effect of nitrogen limitation on the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to moisture anomalies using Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's land surface model LM3V-N. We analyzed the response of three central carbon fluxes: net primary productivity (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (R-h), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP, the difference between NPP and R-h) and how these fluxes were altered under anomalies of the standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration index (SPEI). We found that globally, the correlations between each of the carbon flux and SPEI depended on the timescale and a strong legacy effect of SPEI anomalies on R-h. Consideration of nitrogen constraints reduced anomalies in carbon fluxes in response to extreme dry/wet events. This nitrogen-induced buffer constrained the growth of plants under wet extremes and allowed for enhanced growth during droughts. Extra gain of soil moisture from the downregulation of canopy transpiration by nitrogen limitation and shifts in the relative importance of water and nitrogen limitation during dry/wet extreme events are possible mechanisms contributing to the buffering of modeled NPP and NEP. Responses of R-h to moisture anomalies were much weaker compared to NPP, and N buffering effects were less evident.

TI  - Effects of land-use change and disturbance on the fine root biomass, dynamics, morphology, and related C and N fluxes to the soil of forest ecosystems at different elevations at Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania)
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Tropical forests are threatened by anthropogenic activities such as conversion into agricultural land, logging and fires. Land-use change and disturbance affect ecosystems not only aboveground, but also belowground including the ecosystems' carbon and nitrogen cycle. We studied the impact of different types of land-use change (intensive and traditional agroforestry, logging) and disturbance by fire on fine root biomass, dynamics, morphology, and related C and N fluxes to the soil via fine root litter across different ecosystems at different elevational zones at Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania). We found a decrease in fine root biomass (80-90%), production (50%), and C and N fluxes to the soil via fine root litter (60-80%) at all elevation zones. The traditional agroforestry 'Chagga homegardens' (lower montane zone) showed enhanced fine root turnover rates, higher values of acquisitive root morphological traits, but similar stand fine root production, C and N fluxes compared to the natural forest. The decrease of C and N fluxes with forest disturbance was particularly strong at the upper montane zone (60 and 80% decrease, respectively), where several patches of Podocarpus forest had been disturbed by fire in the previous years. We conclude that changes on species composition, stand structure and land management practices resulting from land-use change and disturbance have a strong impact on the fine root system, modifying fine root biomass, production and the C and N supply to the soil from fine root litter, which strongly affects the ecosystems' C and N cycle in those East African tropical forest ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of micro/nanoplastics on pea growth and nitrogen dynamics: The role of biodegradable and conventional plastics
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Unlike conventional micro/nanoplastics (M/NPs), biodegradable M/NPs can increase carbon content in soil and alter microbial functionality, which may differentially affect nitrogen regulation in leguminous plants. To date, their impact on nitrogen dynamics and plant growth in pea plants remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to assess the roles of biodegradable and conventional M/NPs in nitrogen transformation and plant growth within the pea-soil system, and to elucidate the underlying microbial mechanisms governing nitrogen dynamics. Through pot experiments, the effects of conventional plastics (polypropylene and low-density polyethylene) and biodegradable plastic (PLA), in two particle sizes (150 mu m and 500 nm), on pea growth and soil-pea nitrogen variation were systematically studied. Results revealed that PLA M/NPs exhibited a growth-promoting effect, increasing fresh weight by 46.89 %-98.54 % and dry weight by 30.41 %-104.96 % compared to CK, with more pronounced effects than conventional plastics. Micro-PLA treatment significantly increased total nitrogen and NH4+-N content in the soil by 10.86 % and 173.03 %, respectively, while nano-PLA treatment increased these two nitrogen forms by 20.84 % and 73.85 %, respectively. Metagenomic analysis revealed PLA-induced restructuring of nitrogen-cycling microbiota, particularly nano-PLA enrichment of nitrogen-fixing Pseudomonadota. Functional gene analysis demonstrated that micro-PLA significantly up-regulated nitrogen fixation genes (nifK and nifH). Partial least squares path models showed that PLA M/NPs regulated nitrogen cycling-related microbial communities and functional genes by altering soil properties and ultimately affected pea growth. This research reveals the unexpected benefits of PLA M/NPs in promoting soil nitrogen fixation and pea development, offering new perspectives for sustainable agricultural development and environmental management.

TI  - Restoration of nitrogen cycling community in grapevine soil by a decade of organic fertilization
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Traditional intensive agricultural practices negatively impact soil quality, leading to increased erosion in the Mediterranean region. In contrast, sustainable management practices that have utilized organic fertilization over a decade improved soil quality in the Spanish "Pago Casa Gran" vineyard, Valencia. Grape prunings, combined with sheep manure or leguminous cover, have improved soil chemical and biological parameters, such as organic carbon, nitrogen content, respiration, PLFA, total DNA and aggregation, however, there has been a lack of information on their effect on specific functional microbial groups. The nitrogen cycling community of the soil was investigated by quantification of genes involved in key pathways, in particular nitrogen fixation, denitrification and nitrification. The abundances of bacterial nifH, nosZ, nirS and nirK genes significantly increased under a decade of organic fertilization when compared to inorganic fertilization, and was linked to increased soil organic carbon. The abundance of nifH was lower where fertilizers rich in ammonia and nitrate were used and its increase under organic fertilization was more related to the availability of organic carbon than to the nature of the organic amendment. Archaeal amoA abundance did not correlate with the type of fertilization and the bacterial amoA abundance was more dependent on the availability of soluble nitrogen than on the type of management. An increase in nosZ under organic fertilization may suggest a greater abundance of denitrifiers with the ability to reduce nitrous oxide to nitrogen gas, reducing greenhouse gas emission. Our results indicate that soil microbial communities involved in biological nitrogen cycling, in particular nitrogen fixation and de nitrification, are more abundant under management practices that include organic fertilization when compared to traditional agricultural practices. It may therefore be recommended that organic fertilization be utilized in agricultural systems to assist with sustaining healthy soils.

TI  - Microbial Communities, Functional Genes, and Nitrogen Cycling Processes as Affected by Tree Species
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE
CP  - 3rd Annual Meeting of the COST-Action-FP1305-Biolink on Linking Belowground Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in European Forests
AB  - Tree species influence soils through direct and indirect inputs above-and belowground through leaf litter and root inputs. Soil microbial communities can in turn influence tree growth and development through processes such decomposition and chemical transformation of nutrients in soils. In this chapter we will provide an overview of the mechanisms by which trees influence soil microbial communities and nitrogen cycling processes. Specifically, we explore the effects of tree species on ammonification and nitrification processes in forest floor soils, and relate those to functional genetic markers for ammonia-oxidation by archaea and bacteria (amoA AOA and AOB) bacterial denitrification (nirS and nirK). We will cover the use of complementary laboratory methods used to investigate these relationships, including the use of molecular techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to target gene abundances in soils, and 15N tracing experiments to understand the production and consumption of nitrogen. We will also address some of the benefits and drawbacks of these approaches, with special focus on the types of research questions that can be answered using these approaches. The chapter will wrap up with an example study in a common garden tree species trial in Vancouver, B.C., Canada, which demonstrated tree species effects on soil microbial communities and nitrogen cycling dynamics.

TI  - Revisiting nutrient cycling by litterfall-Insights from 15 years of litter manipulation in old-growth lowland tropical forest
T2  - TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS IN THE 21ST CENTURY
AB  - The crucial role of tropical forests in the global carbon balance is underpinned by their extraordinarily high biomass and productivity, even though the majority of tropical forests grow on nutrient-poor soils. Nutrient cycling by litterfall has long been considered essential for maintaining high primary productivity in lowland tropical forests but few studies have tested this assumption experimentally. We review and synthesise findings from the Gigante Litter Manipulation Project (GLiMP), a long-term experiment in lowland tropical forest in Panama, Central America, in which litter has been removed from or added to large-scale plots for 15 years. We assessed changes in soil and litter nutrient concentrations in response to the experimental treatments and estimated nutrient return and nutrient use efficiency to indicate changes in nutrient cycling. The soil concentrations of most nutrients increased with litter addition and declined with litter removal. Litter removal altered nitrogen, potassium, manganese and zinc cycling, demonstrating the importance of litter inputs for maintaining the availability of these elements to plants. By contrast, litter addition only altered nitrogen cycling and, despite low concentrations of available soil phosphorus, the effects of litter manipulation on phosphorus cycling were inconsistent. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying the observed changes, and we emphasise the importance of decomposition processes in the forest floor for retaining nutrient elements, which partially decouples nutrient cycling from the mineral soil. Finally, by synthesising GLiMP studies conducted during 15 years of litter manipulation, we highlight key knowledge gaps and avenues for future research into tropical forest nutrient cycling.

TI  - Microbial community composition and activity in paired irrigated and non-irrigated pastures in New Zealand
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Context Microorganisms are key for carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in soils supporting agricultural production. Aims We investigated the impacts of irrigation on microbial community structure and activity in New Zealand on 28 paired non-irrigated and irrigated grazed pasture sites where C and N had decreased under irrigation. Methods Microbial community structure and microbial biomass (phospholipid fatty acids) and activity (basal respiration, substrate-induced respiration (SIR), aerobically mineralisable N (AerMN)) were assessed. Key results Microbial biomass did not differ between irrigated and non-irrigated soils, but irrigated soils had increased gram-negative bacteria (P < 0.05), lower gram-positive:gram-negative ratio (P < 0.001) and lower fungal:bacterial ratio (P < 0.001) compared to non-irrigated soils. SIR and AerMN were greater in irrigated compared to non-irrigated soils. There were no differences in basal respiration between irrigation treatments. Greater prevalence of gram-negative bacteria (r-strategist) as well as decreases in actinomycetes and fungal to bacterial ratio, and increased SIR and AerMN suggest more rapid cycling of C and nutrients in irrigated systems where C had been lost. Conclusions We found clear evidence that irrigation alters microbial community structure and activity in New Zealand pasture systems. Implications Irrigation driven alteration of microbial populations may contribute to losses of soil SOM and soils' ability to deliver ecosystem services.

TI  - Modeling Carbon and Water Fluxes of Managed Grasslands: Comparing Flux Variability and Net Carbon Budgets between Grazed and Mowed Systems
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - The CenW ecosystem model simulates carbon, water, and nitrogen cycles following ecophysiological processes and management practices on a daily basis. We tested and evaluated the model using five years eddy covariance measurements from two adjacent but differently managed grasslands in France. The data were used to independently parameterize CenW for the two grassland sites. Very good agreements, i.e., high model efficiencies and correlations, between observed and modeled fluxes were achieved. We showed that the CenW model captured day-to-day, seasonal, and interannual variability observed in measured CO2 and water fluxes. We also showed that following typical management practices (i.e., mowing and grazing), carbon gain was severely curtailed through a sharp and severe reduction in photosynthesizing biomass. We also identified large model/data discrepancies for carbon fluxes during grazing events caused by the noncapture by the eddy covariance system of large respiratory losses of C from dairy cows when they were present in the paddocks. The missing component of grazing animal respiration in the net carbon budget of the grazed grassland can be quantitatively important and can turn sites from being C sinks to being neutral or C sources. It means that extra care is needed in the processing of eddy covariance data from grazed pastures to correctly calculate their annual CO2 balances and carbon budgets.

TI  - Invasion by Cenchrus spinifex changes the soil microbial community structure in a sandy grassland ecosystem
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Continuous nitrogen deposition increases the nitrogen content of terrestrial ecosystems and alters the soil nitrogen cycling process. Invasive plants have strong environmental adaptability, which can not only affect the composition and diversity of soil microbial community but also significantly affect the transformation process of soil nitrogen, leading to successful invasion. Currently, research on invasive plant soil ecosystems mainly focused on changes in soil nutrients and soil microorganisms. As an invasive annual grass weed with strong ecological adaptability, the impact of Cenchrus spinifex at different growth periods on soil environment and soil microbial structure composition and diversity in sandy grassland ecosystems is still unclear. In this study, soil samples were collected from four habitats with different degrees of invasion in situ during the vegetation and reproductive growth periods of Cenchrus spinifex. High-throughput sequencing and qPCR technology were used to analyze the changes in the composition, structure and diversity characteristics of the soil microbial communities during Cenchrus spinifex invasion. The results indicated that Cenchrus spinifex invasion had different effects on the soil environment at different growth periods, and Cenchrus spinifex had a preference for the utilization of ammonium nitrogen during vegetation growth period. Moreover, Cenchrus spinifex invasion significantly changed the composition and structure of soil bacterial communities, and the response of soil bacterial and fungal communities to the invasion was inconsistent. Additionally, the bacterial network was more stable than the fungal network. At different growth periods, Cenchrus spinifex had a significant impact on the key microbial communities of soil nitrogen cycling. The invasion increased the abundance of nifH and AOA-amoA, while decreased the abundance of AOA-amoB. Alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus content were key factors that affect vegetation growth period and change the key microbial communities of nitrogen cycling. Alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen, total phosphorus and organic carbon were key factors in reproductive growth period that alter the nitrogen cycling of key microbial communities.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of fire effects on soil carbon and nitrogen: A global meta-analysis
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - A consensus about the fire-related soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) impacts that determine soil health and ecosystem services at the global scale remains elusive. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 3173 observations with 1444, 1334, 228, and 167 observations for soil C, N, pyrogenic C (PyC), and the percent of PyC to total organic C (PyC/TOC) from 296 field studies. Results showed that fire significantly decreased soil C (-15.2%) and N (-14.6%) but increased soil PyC (40.6%) and PyC/TOC (30.3%). Stronger negative fire impacts on soil C and N were found in tropical and temperate climates than in Mediterranean and subtropical climates; stronger effects were found in forest ecosystems than in non-forest ecosystems. Wildfire and high-severity fire led to greater soil C and N losses than prescribed and low-severity fires, respectively, while they promoted greater increases in soil PyC and PyC/TOC than prescribed and low-severity fires, respectively. However, soil C and N recovered to control levels approximately 10 years after fire, which is a shorter period than previously determined. These results suggest that fire-induced PyC production should be accounted for in the C budget under global change. These results will improve our knowledge of the spatiotemporal variability of fire effects on soil C and N storage and have implications for fire management and ecosystem recovery.

TI  - Evidence of Ash Tree (Fraxinus spp.) Specific Associations with Soil Bacterial Community Structure and Functional Capacity
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - The spread of the invasive emerald ash borer (EAB) across North America has had enormous impacts on temperate forest ecosystems. The selective removal of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) has resulted in abnormally large inputs of coarse woody debris and altered forest tree community composition, ultimately affecting a variety of ecosystem processes. The goal of this study was to determine if the presence of ash trees influences soil bacterial communities and/or functions to better understand the impacts of EAB on forest successional dynamics and biogeochemical cycling. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of soil DNA collected from ash and non-ash plots in central Ohio during the early stages of EAB infestation, we found that bacterial communities in plots with ash differed from those without ash. These differences were largely driven by Acidobacteria, which had a greater relative abundance in non-ash plots. Functional genes required for sulfur cycling, phosphorus cycling, and carbohydrate metabolism (specifically those which breakdown complex sugars to glucose) were estimated to be more abundant in non-ash plots, while nitrogen cycling gene abundance did not differ. This ash-soil microbiome association implies that EAB-induced ash decline may promote belowground successional shifts, altering carbon and nutrient cycling and changing soil properties beyond the effects of litter additions caused by ash mortality.

TI  - Influence of understory vegetation on soil bacterial communities and nitrogen cycling gene abundance in cool-temperate and sub-alpine forests along an elevational gradient
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - Understanding how the community structures and functions of soil microbes respond to environmental changes is essential for predicting the dynamics of ecosystem functions. Elevational gradients are an ideal setting for "natural experiments" on the relationships between soil microbes and environmental factors. However, little is known about elevational patterns of soil microbial functions and their interactions with aboveground vegetation. We examined community structures and nitrogen cycling gene abundance of soil bacteria in 20 vegetation survey quadrats in cool-temperate and sub-alpine forests along an elevational gradient (1050-2000 m above sea level) in central Japan. The diversity of soil bacterial communities was investigated based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) in the 16S rRNA gene. The abundance of soil bacteria and key functional groups involved in nitrogen cycling was determined by quantifying the 16S rRNA and bacterial genes related to nitrogen fixation (nifH), ammonia oxidation (amoA), and denitrification (nosZ). The terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) richness of soil bacteria showed no relationship with elevation, but was negatively associated with soil nitrate-nitrogen and the species richness of understory vegetation. The abundance of all bacteria and nitrogen functional groups showed hump-shaped relationships with elevation, and was positively associated with soil water content and understory stem density. These results highlight that community structures and nitrogen cycling gene abundance of soil microbes along the elevational gradient can be explained by soil properties associated with understory vegetation. This suggests that vegetation decline caused by environmental changes, such as climate warming, land use change, and increased herbivore density, may deteriorate soil ecosystem functions through aboveground-belowground interactions.

TI  - Restoring wetlands on intensive agricultural lands modifies nitrogen cycling microbial communities and reduces N2O production potential
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - The concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O), an ozone-depleting greenhouse gas, is rapidly increasing in the atmosphere. Most atmospheric N2O originates in terrestrial ecosystems, of which the majority can be attributed to microbial cycling of nitrogen in agricultural soils. Here, we demonstrate how the abundance of nitrogen cycling genes vary across intensively managed agricultural fields and adjacent restored wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California, USA. We found that the abundances of nirS and nirK genes were highest at the intensively managed organic-rich cornfield and significantly outnumber any other gene abundances, suggesting very high N2O production potential. The quantity of nitrogen transforming genes, particularly those responsible for denitrification, nitrification and DNRA, were highest in the agricultural sites, whereas nitrogen fixation and ANAMMOX was strongly associated with the wetland sites. Although the abundance of nosZ genes was also high at the agricultural sites, the ratio of nosZ genes to nir genes was significantly higher in wetland sites indicating that these sites could act as a sink of N2O. These findings suggest that wetland restoration could be a promising natural climate solution not only for carbon sequestration but also for reduced N2O emissions.

TI  - Significant effects of precipitation frequency on soil respiration and its components-A global synthesis
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Global warming intensifies the hydrological cycle, which results in changes in precipitation regime (frequency and amount), and will likely have significant impacts on soil respiration (R-s). Although the responses of R-s to changes in precipitation amount have been extensively studied, there is little consensus on how R-s will be affected by changes in precipitation frequency (PF) across the globe. Here, we synthesized the field observations from 296 published papers to quantify the effects of PF on R-s and its components using meta-analysis. Our results indicated that the effects of PF on R-s decreased with an increase in background mean annual precipitation. When the data were grouped by climate conditions, increased PF showed positive effects on R-s under the arid condition but not under the semi-humid or humid conditions, whereas decreased PF suppressed R-s across all the climate conditions. The positive effects of increased PF mainly resulted from the positive response of heterotrophic respiration under the arid condition while the negative effects of decreased PF were mainly attributed to the reductions in root biomass and respiration. Overall, our global synthesis provided for the first time a comprehensive analysis of the divergent effects of PF on R-s and its components across climate regions. This study also provided a framework for understanding and modeling responses of ecosystem carbon cycling to global precipitation change.

TI  - A comparison of soil respiration, carbon balance and root carbon use efficiency in two managed Moso bamboo forests in subtropical China
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Moso bamboo forest (Phyllostachys heterocycla [Carr.] Mitford cv. Pubescens) is an important forest type in subtropical China and comprises an important pool in the global carbon cycle. Understanding the effects of the stand management, such as understory removal, on soil respiration (RS) will help to provide a more accurate estimation of carbon cycling and predict future climate change. The study aimed to compare RS and net ecosystem production (NEP) in two Moso bamboo forests managed by the application of herbicide (AH) and conventional hand-weeded (HW) treatment, and further examine their root carbon use efficiency (RCUE). Trenching and litter removal were used to partition the source components of RS and one-year field measurement was conducted. Maximum-minimum approach was used to estimate fine root production. NEP was determined by the balance between NPP of vegetation and heterotrophic respiration (RH) of soil. RCUE was calculated using an indirect method. In both stands, soil temperature and soil moisture at 5 cm depth were the main driving forces to the seasonality of RS. Annual RS was 31.6 t CO2 ha(-1) for the stand AH and 33.9 t CO2 ha(-1) for the stand HW, while net ecosystem production (NEP) were 21.9 and 21.1 t CO2 ha(-1), respectively, indicating that the both Moso bamboo stands acted as carbon sinks in the scenarios of current climate change. The RCUE was 30.6% for the stand AH, which was significantly lower than that for the stand HW (58.8%). This result indicates that different stand management practices can alter RCUE and the assumed constant universal carbon use efficiency (CUE) of 50% is not appropriate in Moso bamboo forests. This study highlight the importance of partition the source components of RS and accurate estimation of RCUE in modelling carbon cycling in Moso bamboo forests.

TI  - Elevation-dependent distribution of soil microbial necromass carbon in Pinus densata Mast. forests
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil microbial necromass carbon (MNC) is an important component of soil organic carbon (SOC). However, its distribution patterns and driving mechanisms in alpine forest ecosystems remain understudied. MNC plays a crucial role in soil carbon storage and stability, profoundly influencing the carbon cycling in sensitive ecosystems and under climate change. Therefore, elucidating the distribution patterns of MNC and the factors driving them is essential for understanding the carbon cycle in alpine ecosystems and predicting the impacts of climate change. This study focuses on the Pinus densata Mast. forests of the Sygera Mountain, examining the distribution of MNC by collecting soil profile samples from 0 to 40 cm depths along an elevational gradient (3100 m, 3400 m, and 3700 m). Our findings reveal the following: 1) The total MNC decreases with elevation, and fungal necromass carbon content is significantly higher than bacterial necromass carbon at all elevations and soil depths; 2) Microbial necromass carbon content decreases with increasing soil depth, and its relative contribution to SOC increases with depth; 3) The content of MNC is primarily regulated by the joint effects of environmental factors and microbial characteristics, with soil nutrient content, elevation gradient, and microbial features being the main factors influencing the accumulation of MNC. This study elucidates the distribution patterns and driving factors of microbial necromass in alpine forest ecosystems, providing crucial scientific insights into the soil microbial carbon cycle in alpine ecosystems.

TI  - Enantioselective effects of cyflumetofen on microbial community and related nitrogen cycle gene function in acid-soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Cyflumetofen (CYF) is a novel chiral acaricide widely used in commercial crops to control mites. The environmental risks exposed by CYF in the soil, especially at the enantiomer level, remain unclear. We found that the (+)-CYF enantiomer was preferentially degraded in acid-soil, resulting in (-)-CYF enrichment. 16S rRNA and qPCR analysis indicated that decreased bacterial abundance by 12.79-61.80% and 2.52-52.48% in (-)-CYF treatment and (+)-CYF treatment, respectively. Diversity was also decreased with (-)-CYF treatment. Interestingly, several beneficial bacteria, for instance, Alphaproteobacteria (class), Sphingomonadaceae (family), and Arthrobacter (specise) were more enriched following (-)-CYF. The abundance of N-2-fixing bacteria showed a sustained reduction with time, and the decrease was 3.24-72.94% with (-)-CYF and 25.37-73.11% with (+)-CYF treatment. Compared with the (+)-CYF treatment could positively promote nitrification, while the treatment (-)-CYF significantly reduced the abundance of amoA gene; namely it significantly negatively affected the nitrification in the nitrogen cycle. Through our further research, we found that Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Lysobacter; Sphingomonas, Patescibacteria, Saccharimonadia, and Saccharimonadales showed synergistic effects with the nitrogen cycling-related genes nifH and amoA. These results contribute to a comprehensive environmental risk assessment of CYF in acid-soil at the enantiomer level. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Niche differentiation of denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizing bacteria and archaea leads to effective methane filtration in a Tibetan alpine wetland
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) is a vital methane sink in wetlands. However, the interactions and niche partitioning of DAMO bacteria and archaea in freshwater wetland soils, in addition to the interactions among microorganisms that couple methane and nitrogen cycling is still unclear, despite that these factors may govern the fate of methane and nitrogen in wetlands. Here, we evaluated the vertical distribution of DAMO bacteria and archaea in soil layers along with the potential interactions among populations in the methane-coupled nitrogen cycling microbial community of Tibetan freshwater wetlands. A combination of molecular biology, stable isotope tracer technology, and microbial bioinformatics was used to evaluate these interrelated dynamics. The abundances and potential methane oxidation rates indicated that DAMO bacteria and archaea differentially occupy surface and subsurface soil layers, respectively. The inferred interactions between DAMO bacteria and nitrogen cycling microorganisms within their communities are complex, DAMO bacteria apparently achieve an advantage in the highly competitive environment of surface soils layers and occupy a specific niche in those environments. Conversely, the apparent relationships between DAMO archaea and nitrogen cycling microorganisms are relatively simple, wherein high levels of cooperation are inferred between DAMO archaea and nitrate-producing organisms in subsurface soils layers. These results suggest that the vertical distribution patterns of DAMO bacteria and archaea enable them to play significant roles in the methane oxidation activity of different soil layers and collectively form an effective methane filtration consortium.

TI  - The Composition and Phosphorus Cycling Potential of Bacterial Communities Associated With Hyphae of Penicillium in Soil Are Strongly Affected by Soil Origin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Intimate fungal-bacterial interactions are widespread in nature. However the main drivers for the selection of hyphae-associated bacterial communities and their functional traits in soil systems remain elusive. In the present study, baiting microcosms were used to recover hyphae-associated bacteria from two Penicillium species with different phosphorus-solubilizing capacities in five types of soils. Based on amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, the composition of bacterial communities associated with Penicillium hyphae differed significantly from the soil communities, showing a lower diversity and less variation in taxonomic structure. Furthermore, soil origin had a significant effect on hyphae-associated community composition, whereas the two fungal species used in this study had no significant overall impact on bacterial community structure, despite their different capacities to solubilize phosphorus. However, discriminative taxa and specific OTUs were enriched in hyphae-associated communities of individual Penicillium species indicating that each hyphosphere represented a unique niche for bacterial colonization. Additionally, an increased potential of phosphorus cycling was found in hyphae-associated communities, especially for the gene phnK involved in phosphonate degradation. Altogether, it was established that the two Penicillium hyphae represent unique niches in which microbiome assemblage and phosphorus cycling potential are mainly driven by soil origin, with less impact made by fungal identity with a divergent capacity to utilize phosphorus.

TI  - Polyethylene microplastic and soil nitrogen dynamics: Unraveling the links between functional genes, microbial communities, and transformation processes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) have emerged as pollutants of growing concern due to their potential threat to soil ecosystems. While some studies have investigated the effects of MPs on soil nitrogen content, the underlying physicochemical and microbial driving mechanisms still need to be explored. In this study, a six-month incubation experiment was conducted with varying polyethylene MP addition rates: CK (0%, mass ratio), MP0.5 (0.5%), MP1 (1%), MP2 (2%), MP4 (4%), and MP8 (8%). The experiment aimed to examine the effects of MPs on soil nitrogen content, physicochemical properties, nitrogen cycling-related genes, microorganisms, and gross nitrogen transformation rates. The results revealed no significant changes in soil total nitrogen and dissolved total nitrogen. However, dissolved organic nitrogen significantly decreased by 16.00-54.60% following MP addition, while ammonium (NH4+-N, 45.71-271.43%) and nitrate (NO3- -N, 43.15-209.54%) nitrogen and microbial biomass nitrogen (46.02-123.70%) significantly increased. Soil pH, bulk density, and soil porosity decreased after MP addition, while soil carbon contents, water-stable macroaggregates, and redox potential increased. The soil microbial community structure changed significantly, and microbial diversity increased under MP treatment. MP addition significantly altered the abundance of soil nitrogen cycling functional genes. The relative abundance of nitrogen fixation and denitrification genes decreased with increasing MP addition rates, while organic degradation and synthesis genes increased. The soil nitrogen cycling functional microbial composition shifted dramatically with increased MP addition. Networks with high addition rates (MP2 +MP4 +MP8) exhibited more total nodes, total links, negative links, node degrees, and modules but shorter average path distances and lower modularity than those with low addition rates (CK +MP0.5 +MP1), reflecting increased network complexity induced by MPs. The gross ammonification rate, NH4+-N consumption and immobilization rates, and NO3--N immobilization rate increased, while the gross nitrification rate and net nitrification rate exhibited an initial increase followed by a decrease with increasing MP addition rates, peaking at MP2. Furthermore, redundancy analysis and structural equation modeling demonstrated that soil physicochemical properties significantly affected soil nitrogen cycling genes and microorganisms, ultimately altering nitrogen content. In conclusion, polyethylene MPs promoted soil nitrogen mineralization and transformation and changed the related functional microorganism community structure, exhibiting a noticeable dose-effect relationship. This study provides deeper insight into the effects of MPs on soil nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Soil available nitrogen and phosphorus affected by functional bacterial community composition and diversity as ecological restoration progressed
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Available nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most common elements limiting the success of ecosystem restoration. Soil microbial communities, harbouring the alkaline metalloprotease (apr) gene and alkaline phosphatase activity gene (phoD), play a crucial role in regulating and maintaining soil available N and P. However, the dynamics ofapr- andphoD-harbouring bacteria and their contributions to regulating soil available N and P balances remain largely unexplored as ecological restoration proceeded. In this study, we investigated the community dynamics ofapr- andphoD-harbouring bacteria during the plant growing season in association with the long-term passive (40 years) and active (35 years) restoration of degraded ecosystems. The results showed that soil available N steadily increased while available P typically decreased as ecosystem restoration proceeded. The passive and active restoration efforts resulted in a higher available N balance than available P balance. Passive and active restoration significantly enhanced the abundances, diversities of OTUs, and beta diversities ofapr- andphoD-harbouring bacteria. Notably, the alpha diversity ofapr-harbouring bacteria did not keep pace with that ofphoD-harbouring bacteria with increased site age. Our results indicated that the distinct beta diversities of theapr- andphoD-harbouring bacteria were the predominant cause of the variation in the available N and P balance. Our findings provide a foundation for a better understanding of the distinct responses ofapr- andphoD-harbouring bacteria to ecological restoration and how they ultimately regulate the available N and P balance in the developing soils of degraded ecosystems.

TI  - Long-term snowpack manipulation promotes large loss of bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus in a subalpine grassland
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Nutrient retention in ecosystems requires synchrony between the supply of bioavailable nutrients released via mineralization and nutrient uptake by plants. Though disturbance and chronic nutrient loading are known to alter nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics and induce nutrient export, whether long-term shifts in climate affect source-sink synchrony, and ultimately primary productivity, remains uncertain. This is particularly true for snow-dominated ecosystems, which are naturally subject to lags between nutrient inputs and uptake. To address how climate change may affect nutrient source-sink synchrony we examined the impacts of deepened snowpack on N and P losses in a subalpine grassland in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA, where we have experimentally increased snowpack depths by two- and four-times ambient snow for 45 years. Long-term snow addition resulted in remarkably high levels of bioavailable-N leaching (up to 16 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) that were 11-80 times higher than those under ambient snowpack. Estimated bioavailable-P losses also increased with snow addition, but to a lesser degree (up to 0.3 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), indicating greater enhancement of N losses over P losses during snowmelt. Because these losses could not be explained by changes in nutrient inputs in snowpack or by changes in plant-soil turnover, our results suggest that high bioavailable-N leaching under deep snowpack originates not from a lack of N limitation of plant productivity, but rather from enhanced subnivean microbial processes followed by snowmelt leaching prior to the growing season. This is supported by reduced soil N pools in the snow treatments. Snow-dominated regions are projected to experience shifts in seasonal snowpack regime. These shifts may ultimately affect the stoichiometric balance between available N and P and future plant productivity.

TI  - Agricultural management and plant selection interactively affect rhizosphere microbial community structure and nitrogen cycling
T2  - MICROBIOME
AB  - Background: Rhizosphere microbial communities are key regulators of plant performance, yet few studies have assessed the impact of different management approaches on the rhizosphere microbiomes of major crops. Rhizosphere microbial communities are shaped by interactions between agricultural management and host selection processes, but studies often consider these factors individually rather than in combination. We tested the impacts of management (M) and rhizosphere effects (R) on microbial community structure and co-occurrence networks of maize roots collected from long-term conventionally and organically managed maize-tomato agroecosystems. We also explored the interaction between these factors (MxR) and how it impacts rhizosphere microbial diversity and composition, differential abundance, indicator taxa, co-occurrence network structure, and microbial nitrogen-cycling processes.
   Results: Host selection processes moderate the influence of agricultural management on rhizosphere microbial communities, although bacteria and fungi respond differently to plant selection and agricultural management. We found that plants recruit management-system-specific taxa and shift N-cycling pathways in the rhizosphere, distinguishing this soil compartment from bulk soil. Rhizosphere microbiomes from conventional and organic systems were more similar in diversity and network structure than communities from their respective bulk soils, and community composition was affected by both M and R effects. In contrast, fungal community composition was affected only by management, and network structure only by plant selection. Quantification of six nitrogen-cycling genes (nifH, amoA [bacterial and archaeal], nirK, nrfA, and nosZ) revealed that only nosZ abundance was affected by management and was higher in the organic system.
   Conclusions: Plant selection interacts with conventional and organic management practices to shape rhizosphere microbial community composition, co-occurrence patterns, and at least one nitrogen-cycling process. Reframing research priorities to better understand adaptive plant-microbe feedbacks and include roots as a significant moderating influence of management outcomes could help guide plant-oriented strategies to improve productivity and agroecosystem sustainability.

TI  - Dynamics of soil organic carbon fractions, microbial communities, and carbon cycle functional genes during vegetation restoration in zinc smelting slag sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Vegetation restoration has emerged as an effective strategy to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) pools in degraded mining areas. However, the dynamics of SOC fractions and the underlying microbial mechanisms during vegetation restoration remain poorly understood. This study examined the dynamics of SOC fractions, microbial community structure, and carbon cycle functional genes in the rhizosphere soils of Cryptomeria fortunei (C. fortunei) and Trifolium repens (T. repens), established at zinc smelting slag sites for 4, 6, and 12 years. Results indicated that SOC fractions, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), particle organic carbon (POC), and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC), significantly increased with restoration age and were predominantly distributed within micro-aggregates. Bacterial and fungal abundance and diversity were significantly higher in revegetated soils compared to control (CK) soils. Both microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and microbial residue carbon in bulk soils and aggregates significantly increased over time, with bacterial PLFAs exceeding fungal PLFAs, while fungal residue carbon contributed more than bacterial residue carbon to microbial carbon. Total PLFAs were more abundant in 2-0.25 mm aggregates, while total microbial residue carbon was concentrated in <0.25 mm aggregates. In bulk soils, key carbon fixation genes (e.g., korA, gltA, sdhA, mcmA) and degradation genes associated with hemicellulose (e.g., rfbB, xylF, xylH) and starch (e.g., SGA1, malQ) were identified. The abundance of carbon cycling genes initially increased and then decreased in C. fortunei-revegetated soils, whereas a continuous decline was observed in T. repens-revegetated soils. Partial least squares pathway modeling (PLS-PM) revealed that restoration years directly influenced SOC, enzyme activity, and microbial communities, while indirectly affecting carbon cycling genes through changes in microbial communities. Notably, the effects varied between the two plant species. These findings provide valuable insights into SOC dynamics and microbial ecological processes during vegetation restoration in zinc smelting slag sites.

TI  - Effects of cropland-to-orchard conversion on soil multifunctionality, particularly nitrogen cycling in the eastern Loess Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The conversion of cropland to orchards is one of the main measures of the Grain for Green Program for soil and water conservation and ecosystem function maintenance in the eastern Loess Plateau, China. However, the patterns and influencing forces of soil multifunctionality during the conversion from cropland to orchard remain unclear. This study evaluated the responses and regulating factors of soil multifunctionality following the conversion of cropland to pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) orchard along a 10-year chronosequence. Results showed that the conversion of cropland to pomegranate trees significantly increased the L-leucine aminopeptidase enzyme activity from 4.77 to 17.69 nmol g(-1) h(-1). The 10-year pomegranate stand exhibited the highest nitrogen (N) cycle multifunctionality. The N cycle multifunctionality was positively correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon (C) content, soil available phosphorus content, microbial biomass C content, phospholipid fatty acid, and soil feature index (All p < 0.05). Structural equation modeling suggested that the increased N cycle multifunctionality was attributed to soil feature index rather than soil microbial C content and phospholipid fatty acid. Land-use change did not affect soil C cycle, phosphorus cycle, or soil multifunctionality. Overall, our findings reveal that cropland conversion to orchards significantly enhances soil N cycle multifunctionality, highlighting the soil feature index's role in maintaining soil function. The conversion from cropland to orchards, which has economic benefits and increases soil N cycle multifunctionality, is an effective approach of the Grain for Green Program in the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Land use modified impacts of global change factors on soil microbial structure and function: A global hierarchical meta-analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Nitrogen cycling in terrestrial ecosystems is critical for biodiversity, vegetation productivity and biogeochemical cycling. However, little is known about the response of functional nitrogen cycle genes to global change factors in soils under different land uses. Here, we conducted a multiple hierarchical mixed effects meta-analyses of global change factors (GCFs) including warming (W+), mean altered precipitation (MAP+/-), elevated carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO2), and nitrogen addition (N+), using 2706 observations extracted from 200 peer-reviewed publications. The results showed that GCFs had significant and different effects on soil microbial communities under different types of land use. Under different land use types, such as Wetland, Tundra, Grassland, Forest, Desert and Agriculture, the richness and diversity of soil microbial communities will change accordingly due to differences in vegetation cover, soil management practices and environmental conditions.

TI  - Heavy metals in slag affect inorganic N dynamics and soil bacterial community structure and function
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Heavy metal contamination of soil in the vicinity of mining sites is a serious environmental problem around the world when mining residue (slag) is dispersed as dust. We conducted an incubation experiment to investigate the effect of a slag containing high levels of Pb and Zn (62.2 and 33.6 g kg(-1) slag as PbO and ZnO, respectively, sampled from a site formerly used as a lead and zinc mine) on the nitrogen cycle when mixed with soil (0-0.048 g slag g(-1), soil). The nitrogen cycle provides many life supporting-functions. To assess the quality of the soil in terms of the nitrogen cycle we focused on the dynamics of nitrate and ammonium, and bacterial community structure and functions within the soil. After two weeks of pre-incubation, N-15-labeled urea (500 mg N kg(-1)) was added to the soil. Changes in soil pH, the concentration and N-15 ratio of nitrate (NO(3) over bar-N) and ammonium, and bacterial relative abundance and community structure were measured. Results indicated that increasing the ratio of slag to soil had a stronger negative effect on nitrification than ammonification, as suggested by slower nitrate accumulation rates as the slag:soil ratio increased. In the treatment with the highest amount of slag, the concentration of NO(3) over bar-N was 50% of that in the controls at the end of the incubation. Regarding the bacterial community, Firmicutes had a positive and Planctomycetes a negative correlation with increasing slag concentration. Bacterial community functional analysis showed the proportion of bacterial DNA sequences related to nitrogen metabolism was depressed with increasing slag, from 0.68 to 0.65. We concluded that the slag impacted the soil bacterial community structure, and consequently influenced nitrogen dynamics. This study could form the basis of further investigation into the resistance of the nitrogen cycle to contamination in relation to soil bacterial community. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - How do glyphosate and AMPA alter the microbial community structure and phosphorus cycle in rice-crayfish systems?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Glyphosate, a commonly used organophosphorus herbicide in rice-crayfish cropping regions, may alter regional phosphorus cycle processes while affecting the structure of microbial communities. However, the effects of glyphosate residues on rice-crayfish systems remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of glyphosate and its primary degradation products, as well as the impact mechanisms of glyphosate on microbial communities and the phosphorus cycle in rice-crayfish systems such as paddy fields, breeding ditches and recharge rivers. The detection rates of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) were 100% in rice-crayfish systems. Concentrations of glyphosate in the water phase and soil/sediment were as high as 0.012 mu g/L and 7.480 mu g/kg, respectively, and concentrations of AMPA were as high as 17.435 mu g/L and 13.200 mu g/kg, respectively. Glyphosate concentrations were not affected by rainfall or sampling site, but concentrations of AMPA in the water phase of recharge rivers were affected by rainfall. The glyphosate concentration was significantly and positively correlated with RBG-16-58-14 abundance, and the AMPA concentration was significantly and positively correlated with Actinobacteria and Lysobacter abundance, and negatively correlated with Cyanobacteria abundance (P < 0.05). The highest abundances of phoD, phnK, and ppx genes were found in all soils/sediments. Glyphosate concentration in soil/sediment was significantly and positively correlated with the abundance of phoD gene encoding an organophosphorus-degrading enzyme and ppx gene encoding poly inorganic phosphate (Pi) hydrolase (P < 0.05). In addition, the glyphosate concentration was significantly and positively correlated with the Ca-bonded Pi content (P < 0.05). This implies that glyphosate may promote the production of stable Pi in rice-crayfish systems by increasing the abundance of phoD and ppx genes. The results of this study reveal the impact mechanism of glyphosate on the phosphorus cycle in rice crayfish systems and provide a basis for the risk assessment of glyphosate.

TI  - Rethinking assumptions about plant litter decomposition
T2  - BIOSCIENCE
AB  - Plant litter decomposition is the breakdown of dead plant biomass by abiotic and biotic means. In terrestrial ecosystems, decomposition regulates the fate of fixed plant carbon, contributing both to its release into the atmosphere and its long-term storage in soil organic matter. In the present article, we revisit four assumptions about decomposition in light of advances in microbiology. First, we consider fungi as primary decomposers, noting bacterial contributions to breaking down lignin and cellulose and overcoming nitrogen limitation. Second, we discuss evidence of the role of microbial communities on litter decomposition, challenging assumptions of microbial redundancy. Third, given these functional consequences of their composition, we examine whether surface litter and bulk soil microbial communities are interchangeable. Finally, we reevaluate the idea that soil organic matter originates from plant litter, emphasizing the pivotal role of microbial necromass. We highlight the importance of integrating microbiological findings into ecosystem ecology to accelerate research on carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems.

T2  - CLIMATE CHANGE AND MICROBIAL ECOLOGY: CURRENT RESEARCH AND FUTURE TRENDS
AB  - Microbial responses to climate change will partly control the balance of soil carbon storage and loss under future temperature and precipitation conditions. We propose four classes of response mechanisms that can allow for a more general understanding of microbial climate responses. We further explore how a subset of these mechanisms results in microbial responses to climate change using simulation modelling. Specifically, we incorporate soil moisture sensitivity into two current enzyme-driven models of soil carbon cycling and find that moisture has large effects on predictions for soil carbon and microbial pools. Empirical efforts to distinguish among response mechanisms will facilitate our ability to further develop models with improved accuracy.

TI  - Carbon, nitrogen-cycling microbes and functional genes drive the spread of antibiotic resistance genes in landfill humus soil at different depths
T2  - CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB  - The resource utilization of landfill humus soil (LHS) is essential for effective landfill management. However, it poses risks due to the potential spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This study revealed the mechanisms driving ARG and MGE dissemination, mediated by carbon (C)/nitrogen (N)-cycling microbes and functional genes at different LHS depths. The abundances and diversities of C/N-cycling microbes, functional genes, ARGs, and MGEs declined with increasing depth. C/N-cycling processes were significantly correlated with ARG and MGE dissemination (p < 0.05). Microbes and function genes in the shallow layer (FU, 0-4 m) participated in C fixation, C degradation, ammonia assimilation, and nitrate reduction, predominantly influencing the spread of ARGs. In the intermediate (FM, 5-7 m) and deep (FD, 8-17 m) layers, denitrification-and methanogenesis-related microbes and genes played a dominant role in regulating the spread of ARGs. Network analysis revealed that C/N metabolism-related microbes are more closely connected with ARGs and MGEs and exhibit higher information transmission efficiency. The properties of LHS indirectly control the spread of ARGs by influencing microbial metabolism and functional gene expression, confirming that FU, dominated by N metabolism (NH4+ content), exerted the greatest overall effect on ARGs. In contrast, the horizontal gene transfer of ARGs in the deeper layers increasingly relied on C metabolic pathways, as reflected by dissolved organic C (DOC) content. This study provides a novel theoretical foundation for pollution prevention and the optimized utilization of LHS resources.

TI  - The effects and mechanism of urease inhibitor and its combination with nitrification inhibitor on nitrous oxide emission across four soil types
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilization is essential for ensuring crop productivity, while excessive N application significantly increases greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, particularly nitrous oxide (N2O). Urease inhibitors (UI) and combined urease and nitrification inhibitors (UN) have demonstrated potential in mitigating GHGs emission, though their efficiency with great variation across different soils types. In this study, controlled incubation experiments were conducted using four types of agricultural soils to evaluate the mitigation potential of UI and UN application and to investigate their underlying mechanisms. N fertilization significantly increased N2O emissions by 5.1 similar to 99.9-fold and elevated CO2 emissions by 13.6 similar to 65.4% across all soil types. The UI treatment decreased the peak of NO2- concentrations in two alkaline soils, while the UN treatment decreased both NO2- and NO3- concentrations in all four soils. In terms of GHG mitigation, UI treatment reduced N2O emissions by 16.5 similar to 57.4% in alkaline soils and reduced CO2 emissions by 6.5 similar to 49.3% across four soil types. The UN treatment demonstrated superior efficacy, reducing N2O emissions by 52.5 similar to 92.4% and CO2 emissions by 4.2 similar to 87.2% across all soils. Metagenomic sequencing revealed that both UI and UN significantly inhibited the relative abundances of key functional genes associated with nitrification (hao and nxrAB), dissimilatory nitrate reduction (narGHI/napAB), nitrite reduction (nirS/nirK), and nitric oxide reduction (norBC). Random forest identified key factors influencing the N2O mitigation efficiency of UI and UN. These included soil properties such as soil pH, total nitrogen, organic matter, available potassium, water-filled pore space, texture. Additionally, partial functional genes related to nitrification, denitrification, carbon and methane metabolism, sulfur and phosphorus cycling were also identified as key contributors. Overall, these findings provide valuable insights for the region-specific application of UI and UN to effectively mitigate GHGs emissions. The identification of key soil abiotic and biotic factors offers a theoretical foundation for optimizing inhibitors application and enhancing their mitigation efficiency.

TI  - Metagenomics reveals taxon-specific responses of the nitrogen-cycling microbial community to long-term nitrogen fertilization
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Excessive nitrogen (N) fertilization in agricultural ecosystems strongly affects microbial N-cycling processes in soil. However, a comprehensive understanding of how microorganisms involved in each N transformation process respond to long-term N input is lacking. Here, using metagenomic sequencing combined with the direct assembly of N-cycling genes, we found that long-term N fertilization elevated the abundance of the microorganisms involved in most N-transforming processes but decreased that of N-fixing assemblages. The composition of the microbial groups involved in each N-transforming process was altered by fertilization, even though the abundance of several functional genes was not significantly changed. The relative abundance of microbial genera participating in the same step of N-cycling processes correlated with different soil properties, suggesting niche separation of these N-cycling taxa. Our results also indicated that the different responses to N fertilization exhibited by the taxa within the same functional group may be important for sustaining microbial nitrogen cycling in complex and dynamic environments.

TI  - The effects of tree rhizodeposition on soil exoenzyme activity, dissolved organic carbon, and nutrient availability in a subalpine forest ecosystem
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Previous studies have found that root carbon inputs to the soil can stimulate the mineralization of existing soil carbon (C) pools. It is still uncertain, however, whether this "primed" C is derived from elevated rates of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition, greater C release from microbial pools, or both. The goal of this research was to determine how the activities of the microbial exoenzymes that control SOM decomposition are affected by root C inputs. This was done by manipulating rhizodeposition with tree girdling in a coniferous subalpine forest in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA, and following changes in the activities of nine exoenzymes involved in decomposition, as well as soil dissolved organic C, dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen (N), and microbial biomass C and N. We found that rhizodeposition is high in the spring, when the soils are still snow-covered, and that there are large ephemeral populations of microorganisms dependent upon this C. Microbial N acquisition from peptide degradation increased with increases in microbial biomass when rhizodeposition was highest. However, our data indicate that the breakdown of cellulose, lignin, chitin, and organic phosphorus are not affected by springtime increases in soil microbial biomass associated with increases in rhizodeposition. We conclude that the priming of soil C mineralization by rhizodeposition is due to growth of the microbial biomass and an increase in the breakdown of N-rich proteins, but not due to increases in the degradation of plant litter constituents such as cellulose and lignin.

TI  - SIMULATED EFFECTS OF GRAZING ON SOIL-NITROGEN AND MINERALIZATION IN CONTRASTING SERENGETI GRASSLANDS
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The roles of edaphic characteristics and grazing in regulating nitrogen cycling and belowground processes were simulated for the shortgrass and tallgrass regions of the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, by coupling a model of grassland productivity with a model of belowground decomposition processes. Grasslands of each region were simulated under ungrazed and observed grazing intensities to establish reference points for sensitivity analyses using a wide range of grazing intensities and different microbial biomasses. The consequences of patchy carbon and nitrogen deposition were also simulated. Results indicate that nitrogen cycling processes are affected differentially by grazing in the shortgrass and tallgrass regions. Net nitrogen mineralized by the microbial biomass in the shortgrass simulations declined from the ungrazed condition at low grazing intensities, and proceeded to increase from moderate to high grazing intensities. Plant nitrogen uptake was significantly correlated with net mineralization, and soil mineral nitrogen levels were greatest at moderate grazing intensities. In tallgrass simulations, soil mineral nitrogen increased with grazing intensity; net nitrogen immobilization occurred over much of the grazing intensity range because of low decomposition substrate quality. Tallgrass plant nitrogen uptake responded to urine nitrogen input to the soil and was uncorrelated with net mineralization. The potential for nitrogen competition between grasses and microbes was greater in the tallgrass than in the shortgrass because of lower total system nitrogen and lower grazing intensity in the tallgrass. The ecosystem-wide soil nitrogen gradient of the Serengeti governs most properties of nitrogen cycling, while within-region edaphic conditions and grazing create significant variation in local ecosystem processes.

TI  - Biochar application in remediating salt-affected soil to achieve carbon neutrality and abate climate change
T2  - BIOCHAR
AB  - Salt-affected soils urgently need to be remediated to achieve the goals of carbon neutrality and food security. Limited reviews are available on biochar performance in remediating salt-affected soils in the context of carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation. This work summarized the two pathways to achieve carbon neutrality during remediating salt-affected soils using biochars, i.e., biochar production from sustainable feedstock using thermal technologies, application for promoting plant productivity and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Converting biomass wastes into biochars can reduce GHG emission and promote carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and collection of halophyte biomass as biochar feedstocks, development of biochar poly-generation production systems with carbon neutrality or negativity could be promising strategies. Biochar can effectively improve plant growth in salt-affected soils, showing that the grand mean of plant productivity response was 29.3%, via improving physicochemical characteristics, shifting microbial communities, and enhancing plant halotolerance. Moreover, biochar can mitigate GHG emission via inducing negative priming effect, improving soil properties, changing microbial communities associated with carbon and nitrogen cycle, direct adsorption of GHG. However, biochar also may pose negative effects on plant growth because of stress of toxic compounds and free radicals, and deterioration of soil properties. The promoted GHG emission is mainly ascribed to positive priming effect, and provision of labile carbon and inorganic nitrogen fractions as microbial substrates. Finally, this review pointed out the gaps in the current studies and the future perspectives. Particularly, the development of "carbon neutral" or "carbon negative" biochar production system, balancing the relationship of biochar effectiveness and functionality with its environmental risks and costs, and designing biochar-based GHG adsorbents would be important directions for remediating salt-affected soils to achieve carbon neutrality and abate climate change.

TI  - As the worm turns: The earthworm gut as a transient habitat for soil microbial biomes
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The gut of the earthworm constitutes a mobile anoxic microzone to which the microorganisms of aerated soils are subjected. During gut passage, the in situ factors of the earthworm g-ut, which include anoxia and high concentrations of organic substrates, appear to greatly stimulate a subset of ingested soil microorganisms, including denitrifying and fermentative bacteria. The selective stimulation of ingested soil microbes by the unique microconditions of the earthworm gut (a) results in the in vivo emission of denitrification-derived dinitrogen (N-2) and the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) by the earthworm, and (b) might affect the fitness, culturability, and diversity of certain members of soil microbial biomes. These observations illustrate the impact that soil macrofauna might have on terrestrial nitrogen cycle processes via their transient hosting of ingested prokaryotes.

TI  - Plant communities, soil microorganisms, and soil carbon cycling: Does altering the world belowground matter to ecosystem functioning?
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Soil microorganisms mediate many critical ecosystem processes. Little is known, however, about the factors that determine soil microbial community composition, and whether microbial community composition influences process rates. Here, we investigated whether aboveground plant diversity affects soil microbial community composition, and whether differences in microbial communities in turn affect ecosystem process rates. Using an experimental system at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, we found that plant diversity (plots contained 1, 3, 5, or > 25 plant species) had a significant effect on microbial community composition (as determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis). The different microbial communities had significantly different respiration responses to 24 labile carbon compounds. We then tested whether these differences in microbial composition and catabolic capabilities were indicative of the ability of distinct microbial communities to decompose different types of litter in a fully factorial laboratory litter transplant experiment. Both microbial biomass and microbial community composition appeared to play a role in litter decomposition rates. Our work suggests, however, that the more important mechanism through which changes in plant diversity affect soil microbial communities and their carbon cycling activities may be through alterations in their abundance rather than their community composition.

TI  - Exploring microbial players for metagenomic profiling of carbon cycling bacteria in sundarban mangrove soils
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The Sundarbans, the world's largest tidal mangrove forest, acts as a crucial ecosystem for production, conservation, and the cycling of carbon and nitrogen. The study explored the hypothesis that microbial communities in mangrove ecosystems exhibit unique taxonomic and functional traits that play a vital part in carbon cycling and ecosystem resilience. Using metagenomic analysis to evaluate microbial communities in mangrove and non-mangrove environment, evaluating their composition, functional functions, and ecological relevance. The analysis revealed distinct microbial profiles, in mangrove and non-mangrove environments, with bacteria, proteobacteria, and viruses being the most prevalent groups, with varying abundances in each environment. Functional and taxonomical analysis identified genes involved in carbon regulation, including Triacylglycerol lipase, NarG, DsrB, DNA-binding transcriptional dual regulator CRP, Vanillate O-demethylase oxygenase, succinate-CoA ligase, Tetrahydrofolate ligase, Carboxylase, Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, Glycine hydroxymethyltransferase, MAG: urease, Endosymbiont of Oligobrachia haakonmosbiensis, Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase, Aconitate hydratase AcnA, and nitrous oxide reductase, suggesting the metabolic versatility of these microbial communities for carbon cycling. The findings emphasize the key role of microbial activity in preserving mangrove ecosystem health and resilience, highlighting the intricate interplay between microbial diversity, functional capabilities, and environmental factors.

TI  - The spatio-temporal accumulation of 6 PPD-Q in greenbelt soils and its effects on soil microbial communities☆
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - 6 PPD-Q (6 PPD-Quinone) is an ozone-induced byproduct derived from the degradation of N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N '-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6 PPD), commonly found in road dust resulting from tire wear. However, the extent of 6 PPD-Q pollution in urban soil remains unclear. This study investigates the spatial and temporal accumulation patterns of 6 PPD-Q in greenbelt soils in Ningbo, and explores the correlation between 6 PPD-Q accumulation and soil microbial community composition and functions. Our findings indicate that 6 PPD-Q is present (ranging from 0.85 to 12.58 mu g/kg) in soil samples collected from both sides of urban traffic arteries. Soil fungi exhibit higher sensitivity to 6 PPD-Q accumulation compared to bacteria, and associated fungi (Basidiomycota) may be potential biomarkers for environmental 6 PPD-Q contamination. Co-occurrence network analysis reveals that the bacterial microbial network in summer exhibits greater stability and resilience in response to 6 PPD-Q inputs than in winter. However, 6 PPD-Q accumulation disrupts the network structure of fungal communities to some extent, leading to reduced diversity in fungal microbial communities. Long-term accumulation of 6 PPD-Q weakens the nitrogen and phosphorus cycling potential within urban soil, while the enhancement of carbon cycling may further promote 6 PPD-Q degradation in urban soil. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the ecological risks of 6 PPD-Q in urban soils.

TI  - Co-occurrences of soil nitrogen cycling and human-disease genes following spent mushroom substrate and nitrification inhibitor applications: A strategy for decreasing health risk
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Spent mushroom substrates can be utilized as organic fertilizer in agricultural production but may pose a health risk. Nitrification inhibitors dicyandiamide and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate have been used to enhance fertilizer nitrogen utilization efficiency. However, the changes of soil abiotic properties, microbial activities, nitrogen cycling and human-disease genes, and their comprehensive relationships after the spent mushroom substrate and nitrification inhibitor applications were still unknown. In this study, the spent mushroom substrate and nitrification inhibitor were applied into the agricultural soils at the rates of 2.5% (w/w) and 1.0% of nitrogen content in the spent mushroom substrate, respectively, and then lettuce was planted. Compared with the control, spent mushroom substrate application significantly increased the lettuce biomass, soil enzyme activities and chitinase, protease, nitric-oxide reductase, nitrogenase, and urease gene abundances. However, the antibiotic resistance and human-disease gene abundances were also significantly enhanced following the spent mushroom substrate application. Relative to spent mushroom substrate alone, the dicyandiamide application significantly decreased the soil pH and human-disease gene abundances, although extra dicyandiamide and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate enhanced 61.4% and 45.0% of dry biomass of aboveground lettuce. The human-disease gene abundances were positively correlated with soil pH but were negatively correlated with the Acidobacteria and Streptomyces ratios in soils. Spent mushroom substrate application could generate double-edged sword effects, and the health risk should be considered in the spent mushroom substrate applications. Extra dicyandiamide application could further promote crop growth while decrease the human-disease risk from the spent mushroom substrate.

TI  - Changes in snow cover alter nitrogen cycling and gaseous emissions in agricultural soils
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Climate change-related increases in winter temperatures and precipitation, as predicted for eastern Canada, may alter snow cover, with consequences for soil temperature and moisture, nitrogen cycling, and greenhouse gas fluxes. To assess the effects of snow depth in a humid temperate agricultural ecosystem, we conducted a two-year field study with (1) snow removal, (2) passive snow accumulation (via snow fence), and (3) ambient snow treatments. We measured in situ N2O and CO2 fluxes and belowground soil gas concentration, and conducted denitrification and potential nitrification laboratory assays, from November through May. Snow manipulation significantly affected winter N2O dynamics. In the first winter, spring thaw N2O fluxes in snow removal plots were 31 and 48 times greater than from ambient snow and snow accumulation plots respectively. Mid-winter soil N2O concentration was also highest in snow removal plots. These effects may have been due to increased substrate availability due to greater soil frost, along with moderate gas diffusivities facilitating N2O production, in snow removal plots. In the second winter, spring thaw N2O fluxes and soil N2O concentration were greatest for ambient snow plots. Peak fluxes in ambient snow plots were 19 and 24 times greater than in snow accumulation and snow removal plots, respectively. Greater soil moisture in ambient snow plots overwinter could have facilitated denitrification both through decreased O-2 availability and increased disruption of soil aggregates during freeze-thaw cycles. Overall, results suggest that effects of changing snow cover on N cycling and N2O fluxes were not solely a direct effect of snow depth; rather, effects were mediated by both soil water content and temperature. Furthermore, the fact that treatments with greatest mid-winter belowground N2O accumulation also had greatest spring thaw N2O fluxes in both years suggests the hypothesis that high spring thaw fluxes were due not only to spring soil conditions, but also to an effect of soil conditions in frozen soils that had facilitated N2O production throughout winter.

TI  - Drought impacts on microbial trait distribution and feedback to soil carbon cycling
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Quantifying the impact of drought on microbial processes and its consequences for soil carbon cycling is hindered by the lack of underlying mechanistic understanding. Therefore, there is a need to scale up the physiological response to changing water status from individual soil microbes to collective communities across different ecosystems.
   2. Here we propose the use of a framework that incorporates trait-based ecology to link drought-impacted microbial processes to rates of soil carbon decomposition and stabilisation. We briefly synthesise existing knowledge on the effects of drought on microbial physiology at the individual to community scale, before integrating this understanding within a framework incorporating life-history strategy, ecological strategy and biochemistry.
   3. This framework highlights a dynamic allocation to high yield (Y), resource acquisition (A) and stress tolerance (S) pathways as environmental conditions change. Y-A-S strategies represent sets of traits that tend to correlate due to physiological or evolutionary trade-offs. This framework enables assessment of microbial processes along two key environmental gradients of water and resource availability, both of which are constrained by drought.
   4. The variable chemistry of biomass and necromass produced under different physiological strategies in response to drying-rewetting impacts organic matter decomposition and stabilisation in soils, and should also be considered when quantifying soil carbon balance. We highlight that diversion of resources away from microbial growth can alter soil organic matter chemistry and its persistence depending on the kind of microbial compounds produced.
   5. To advance such a framework, we highlight avenues of research that would enable the further identification and quantification of traits linked to Y-A-S strategies and the physiological outcomes at the community level under drought and rewetting, and conclude by hypothesising how ecosystem-level changes might feedback on to the soil carbon cycle. A scalable understanding of microbial drought-response mechanisms affecting soil carbon cycling will transform the way microbial physiology is represented in ecosystem studies.

TI  - The global methane cycle:: Isotopes and mixing ratios, sources and sinks
T2  - ISOTOPES IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH STUDIES
AB  - A review of the global cycle of methane is presented with emphasis on its isotopic composition. The history of methane mixing ratios, reconstructed from measurements of air trapped in ice-cores is described. The methane record now extends back to 420 kyr ago in the case of the Vostok ice cores from Antarctica. The trends in mixing ratios and in delta(13)C values are reported for the two Hemispheres. The increase of the atmospheric methane concentration over the past 200 years, and by 1% per year since 1978, reaching 1.7 ppmv in 1990 is underlined.
   The various methane sources are presented. Indeed the authors describe the methane emissions by bacterial activity under anaerobic conditions in wet environments (wetlands, bogs, tundra, rice paddies), in ruminant stomachs and termite guts, and that originating from fossil carbon sources, such as biomass burning, coal mining, industrial losses, automobile exhaust, sea floor vent, and volcanic emissions. Furthermore, the main sinks of methane in the troposphere, soils or waters via oxidation are also reported, and the corresponding kinetic isotope effects.

TI  - Delivery rate alters the effects of tire wear particles on soil microbial activities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
AB  - Background Tire wear particles (TWPs) produced by the abrasion between tires and road surfaces have been recognized as an emerging threat to soil health globally in recent years. They can be transported from the road surface to adjacent soil at different delivery rates, with precipitation a main driver underpinning this movement. However, studies typically assume an abrupt exposure of TWPs in their experimental design. In this study, we investigated the impacts of abrupt and gradual delivery of TWPs on soil physicochemical properties and microbial activities. We used two different delivery rates of TWPs (abrupt and gradual) and devised two experimental phases, namely the TWPs-delivery period (phase 1) and the end-of-delivery period (phase 2).Results We found that the gradual TWPs delivery treatments negatively influenced the activity of carbon cycle-related enzymes (beta-glucosidase and beta-D-1,4-cellobiosidase). Furthermore, the abrupt treatment highly increased the effects on nitrogen cycle-related enzyme activity (beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase). In phase 2 (end-of-delivery period), each enzyme activity was returned to a similar level as the control group, and these changes between phases 1 and 2 depended on the prior delivery rates.Conclusion Abruptly and gradually delivered TWPs induce different responses to soil microbial activities. Our findings imply that the delivery rate of TWPs could be a key factor changing the effects of TWPs, further enhancing our understanding of the ecological impacts of TWPs.

TI  - Fungal inhibition by Bromelia pinguin (Bromeliaceae) and its effect on nutrient cycle dynamics
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Few studies have been done on the ecology of Bromelia pinguin (Bromeliaceae), a bromeliad with unique characteristics found throughout Central America and the Caribbean. In particular, the fruit pulp has antifungal properties against many fungal strains. We looked at the differences in belowground nutrient processes and the microbial community within bromeliad soil and in adjacent ecotonal and primary forest soils. PCR-based analysis of universal fungal 18S rRNA and universal bacterial 16S rRNA were used as indicators of inhibition, while analysis of basidiomycete internal transcribed space (ITS) was used to see if inhibition was preferential towards basidiomycota. Rhizobial 16S rRNA PCR-based abundance methods were used to determine if the plant affected nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The data suggest that this bromeliad does inhibit fungi and Basidiomycetes within the soil. Moreover, the increased soil dissolved organic carbon and decreased microbial biomass, and the lack of fungal and basidiomycete DNA, in the bromeliad soils suggests a reduced biomass of fungi and basidiomycetes in these soils may decrease the capacity to breakdown the more complex forms of organic carbon. There was decreased abundance and diversity, but greater dominance (i.e., decreased evenness) of Rhizobium 16S rRNA in the bromeliad soil. This, along with the similar amount of ammonium in all soils, and the greater amount of nitrate in the bromeliad soils, suggests that the properties of bromeliad soil select for fewer, more dominant rhizobial species, and that there may be more ammonium oxidizing activity occurring in these soils.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi decrease soil nitrate by accelerating mulberry uptake and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB  - Karst landforms, characterized by their shallow and nutrient-poor soils, are susceptible to nitrate leaching loss, leading to environmental pollution and health risks. This study investigates the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in mitigating deep soil nitrate accumulation through enhanced mulberry uptake and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). A 4-month symbiotic experiment with mulberry (Morus alba L.) and two AMF species (Funneliformis mosseae and Rhizophagus intraradices) was conducted. We found that AMF treatments significantly reduced soil nitrate levels by 10.5 %-58.9 %, while increased soil ammonium by 35.9 %-63.3 %, and enhanced mulberry nitrogen accumulation by 5.2 %-17.8 %. Microbial community analysis revealed significant shifts in nitrogen-cycling microorganisms, with Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria as dominant phyla. AMF inoculation slowed nitrification and denitrification in deeper soil layers while accelerating DNRA, as evidenced by changes in the abundance of nirK/ nirS and nrfA/nrfH genes. Structural equation modeling underscored the significant feedback effects of plants and soil nitrogen-cycling microorganisms under AMF influence. This study provides novel insights into the ecological benefits of mycorrhizal symbiosis in managing soil nitrogen dynamics.

TI  - Soil extracellular enzyme activities under long-term fertilization management in the croplands of China: a meta-analysis
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB  - The effects of fertilization and residue retention practices on enhancing crop yield and soil productivity, have been extensively investigated in various cropping system studies. However, various potential interactions exist among system components (soil, plant, microbial). The multitude and complexity of these interactions results in variability in agroecological responses, such as the soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs). Using a meta-analysis of 85 peer-reviewed articles published in the past three decades, we synthesized the EEAs of four major soil enzymes (urease, phosphatase, invertase, and peroxidase), which are affected by various fertilization and residue management practices used in cropping systems of China. The combined application of straw residues and chemical fertilizers, and straw residues only significantly increased soil organic carbon (by 38 and 47%, respectively) and total nitrogen (by 26 and 57%, respectively) as compared to the non-fertilized control. Manure plus chemical fertilizer treatments showed a consistent increase in urease, phosphatase and invertase activity by 86, 34 and 37%, respectively, as compared to the non-fertilized control. The use of inorganic fertilizers increased the activity of soil EEAs involved in carbon- and phosphorus-cycling, but did not decrease EEAs involved in nitrogen-cycling as expected. The experimental duration had a significant impact on urease activity, particularly with unbalanced application of chemical fertilizers. Therefore, along with managing fertilizer type, considerable attention should be given to adopting alternative production systems and increasing cropping intensity (preferably double cropping), to enhance soil EEAs.

TI  - Carbon cycling traits of plant species are linked with mycorrhizal strategy
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Ecosystem carbon cycling depends strongly on the productivity of plant species and the decomposition rates of the litter they produce. We tested the hypothesis that classifying plant functional types according to mycorrhizal association explains important interspecific variation in plant carbon cycling traits, particularly in those traits that feature in a hypothesized feedback between vegetation productivity and litter turnover. We compared data from standardized 'screening' tests on inherent potential seedling relative growth rate (RGR), foliar nutrient concentrations, and leaf litter decomposability among 83 British plant species of known mycorrhizal type. There was important variation in these parameters between mycorrhizal plant types. Plant species with ericoid mycorrhiza showed consistently low inherent RGR, low foliar N and P concentrations, and poor litter decomposability; plant species with ectomycorrhiza had an intermediate RGR, higher foliar N and P, and intermediate to poor litter decomposability, plant species with arbuscular-mycorrhiza showed comparatively high RGR, high foliar N and P, and fast litter decomposition. Within the woody species subset, differentiation in RGR between mycorrhizal types was mostly confounded with deciduous versus evergreen habit, but the overall differentiation in litter mass loss between mycorrhizal types remained strong within each leaf habit. These results indicate that, within a representative subset of a temperate flora, ericoid and ectomycorrhizal strategies are linked with low and arbuscular-mycorrhizal species with high ecosystem carbon turnover. The incorporation of mycorrhizal association into current functional type classifications is a valuable tool in the assessment of plant-mediated controls on carbon and nutrient cycling.

TI  - Unraveling the Role of Bacteria in Nitrogen Cycling: Insights from Leaf Litter Decomposition in the Knyszyn Forest
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Microorganisms are vital in leaf litter decomposition and contribute significantly to global nutrient cycling. However, there is a need for improved understanding of the taxonomic and functional diversity of litter-associated bacteria. The Knyszyn Forest comprises a unique ecosystem providing diverse microhabitats for microorganisms in central Europe, similar to the southwestern taiga in many respects. This study presents the results of high-throughput sequencing performed for Betula pendula, B. pubescens, and Carpinus betulus litter-associated microbial communities from northern Poland. Microbial assemblage composition and structure at different stages of litter decomposition revealed the domination of phyllosphere-associated taxa of Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas in bacterial communities in the early stages. Meanwhile, at the later stages of decomposition, the representation of soil-associated bacterial communities, such as Pedobacter, was higher. This study identifies key bacteria (Pedobacter, Mucilaginibacter, and Luteibacter) as pivotal in nutrient cycling through cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition, dominating later decomposition phases. Taxonomic analysis based on functional markers associated with nitrogen metabolism highlights the pivotal role of specific Pseudomonadota (Proteobacteria) taxa in driving nitrogen cycling dynamics during litter decomposition. Most of these taxa were unclassified at the genus level, particularly in the later stages of litter decomposition, and are crucial in mediating nitrogen transformation processes, underscoring their significance in ecosystem nutrient cycling.

TI  - Research on aerobic oxidation of methane bacteria and its influencing factors in Chongqing central city section of the Yangtze River, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
AB  - Bacterial communities play an important role in the carbon cycle of freshwater ecosystems. In order to understand the influencing factors of bacterial community in the process of carbon cycle and search for measures to reduce carbon emissions, Chongqing central city section of the Yangtze River and its tributaries were selected to be the study area in this research. High-throughput sequencing was applied to study aerobic oxidation of methane bacteria (MOB) in sampling area. The results showed that there were spatial differences in the community diversity of aerobic MOB in the Yangtze River in central Chongqing. The Shannon index in the sediment (2.389-2.728) was higher than that in the water (1.820-2.458), and the community diversity in the middle reaches of the main river was higher than that in the upstream and the downstream. The aerobic MOB community was mainly dominated by Type II (Methylocystis). Most of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the top ten had high homology with MOB from river and lake sediments, and a few OTUs had high homology with MOB from paddy fields, forests and wetland soils. The main environmental factors affecting the community structure of aerobic MOB were NH4+-N, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature (T, p <= 0.001), pH (p <= 0.05), methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2).

TI  - Sub-micron microplastics affect nitrogen cycling by altering microbial abundance and activities in a soil-legume system
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Recently, the environmental and agricultural impact of plastic waste has attracted considerable attention. Here, we investigated the impact of sub-micron polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) microplastics (MPs) on nitrogen cycling, with emphasis on bacterial abundance and diversity in a soil-soybean (Glycine max) system. Exposure to soil containing MPs (50 and 500 mg kg-1) did not affect soybean growth, but significantly increased plant nitrogen uptake, which was confirmed by increased activities of nitrogenase in the soil and glutamine synthetase in soybean root. Additionally, there was an increase in 16S gene copy number and carbon and nitrogen substrate utilization, indicating increased abundance and activity of rhizosphere microbial communities. Moreover, MP contamination affected the taxonomic profile of rhizosphere bacteria, especially the abundance of symbiotic and free-living bacteria involved in nitrogen cycling. Furthermore, qPCR analysis of nitrogen-related genes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data revealed an increased abundance of functional genes associated with nitrogen fixation and nitrification. However, the concentration and polymer type of MPs did not have a significant impact in our system. Overall, these results provide insights into the interactions between MPs and rhizosphere bacterial communities in the soil-legume system.

TI  - Temporal effects of thinning on soil organic carbon and carbon cycling-related enzyme activities in oak-pine mixed forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Thinning, a common practice in forest management, has complex effects on soil organic carbon dynamics. In this study, we examined the effects of precommercial thinning on soil organic carbon (SOC) and carbon cyclingrelated enzyme activities in a thinning chronosequence (4-12 year recovery period) of oak-pine mixed forests in the Qinling Mountains, China. Three treatments were selected, namely, the control (CK) with no thinning, the a4 treatment (thinning 4 years ago), and the a12 treatment (thinning 12 years ago). Soil physicochemical properties, such as SOC, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and carbon cycling-related enzyme activities (hydrolase: & beta;-glucosidase [BG], cellobiohydrolase [CBH], and invertase [INV]), were assessed. Our results indicated that thinning significantly reduced SOC by an average of 51.67% in a4 compared to CK, whereas SOC in a12 gradually returned to the unthinned level. The levels of EOC, MBC, BG, and CBH were significantly lower under the a4 and a12 treatments than under the CK treatment. Furthermore, the level of MBC was significantly higher in the a12 treatment than in the a4 treatment. There were no significant differences in DOC or INV among treatments. The structural equation model showed that thinning might regulate SOC by initially decreasing soil water content, MBC, and carbon cyclingrelated enzyme activities, followed by them gradually recovering to unthinned levels. These findings provide a scientific basis for understanding the response of SOC to forest thinning.

TI  - Effects of Applying Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi to Nitrogen Cycle Microorganisms in Soils with Coffee Plantations
T2  - REVISTA CORPOICA-CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA AGROPECUARIA
AB  - Mycorrhizae are associations between plants and beneficial fungi. They are the most active components of the plant's nutrient absorption organs. On the other hand, soil microorganisms are fundamental for their functioning and dynamics as a living system. This research aimed to evaluate the effects of applying arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to the abundance of functional groups associated with the nitrogen cycle of soils with coffee plantations in Sasaima, Cundinamarca, Colombia. The soil samples were collected from four study plots during months 0, 2, and 8 and handled as follows: Plot 1. Application of liquid AMF (75-80 spores/gram of dry powder); Plot 2. Application of AMF in solid formulation (300 spores/gram); Plot 3. Application of native AMF, extracted from the soil under study (25 spores/gram); and Plot 4. Control, no application of AMF. The abundance of soil microorganisms associated with the nitrogen cycle was estimated using the most probable number technique to quantify ammonifying, proteolytic, ammonium-oxidizing, nitriteoxidizing, and denitrifying microorganisms. The standard physicochemical parameters of the soil were measured. Afterward, univariate and multivariate analyses of the data were performed. The results showed a positive correlation between the application of AMF, organic carbon, and phosphorus, higher in the plots with native AMF. However, the abundance of functional groups of the nitrogen cycle did not show significant differences among the treatments; still, the principal components analysis showed a correlation between the plots with liquid and solid AMF, ammonifying microorganisms, and ammonium-oxidizing bacteria.

TI  - A reappraisal of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle: What can we learn by extracting concepts from Gaia theory?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Although soil scientists and most environmental scientists are acutely aware of the interactions between the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, for conceptual convenience when portraying the nitrogen cycle in text books the N cycle tends to be considered in isolation from its interactions with the cycling of other elements and water, usually as a snap shot at the current time; the origins of dinitrogen are rarely considered, for example. The authors suggest that Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis provides a useful and stimulating framework for consideration of the terrestrial nitrogen cycle. If it is used, it suggests that urbanization and management of sewage, and intensive animal rearing are probably bigger global issues than nitrogen deposition from fossil fuel combustion, and that plant evolution may be driven by the requirement of locally sustainable and near optimal soil mineral N supply dynamics. This may, in turn, be partially regulating global carbon and oxygen cycles. It is suggested that pollutant N deposition may disrupt this essential natural plant and terrestrial ecosystem evolutionary process, causing biodiversity change. Interactions between the Earth and other bodies in the solar system, and possibly beyond, also need to be considered in the context of the global N cycle over geological time scales. This is because of direct potential impacts on the nitrogen content of the atmosphere, potential long-term impacts of past boloid collisions on plate tectonics and thus on global N cycling via subduction and volcanic emissions, and indirect effects upon C, 0 and water cycling that all may impact upon the N cycle in the long term.

TI  - Soils and sediments host Thermoplasmata archaea encoding novel copper membrane monooxygenases (CuMMOs)
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Copper membrane monooxygenases (CuMMOs) play critical roles in the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. Organisms harboring these enzymes perform the first, and rate limiting, step in aerobic oxidation of ammonia, methane, or other simple hydrocarbons. Within archaea, only organisms in the order Nitrososphaerales (Thaumarchaeota) encode CuMMOs, which function exclusively as ammonia monooxygenases. From grassland and hillslope soils and aquifer sediments, we identified 20 genomes from distinct archaeal species encoding divergent CuMMO sequences. These archaea are phylogenetically clustered in a previously unnamed Thermoplasmatota order, herein named the Ca. Angelarchaeales. The CuMMO proteins in Ca. Angelarchaeales are more similar in structure to those in Nitrososphaerales than those of bacteria, and contain all functional residues required for general monooxygenase activity. Ca. Angelarchaeales genomes are significantly enriched in blue copper proteins (BCPs) relative to sibling lineages, including plastocyanin-like electron carriers and divergent nitrite reductase-like (nirK) 2-domain cupredoxin proteins co-located with electron transport machinery. Ca. Angelarchaeales also encode significant capacity for peptide/amino acid uptake and degradation and share numerous electron transport mechanisms with the Nitrososphaerales. Ca. Angelarchaeales are detected at high relative abundance in some of the environments where their genomes originated from. While the exact substrate specificities of the novel CuMMOs identified here have yet to be determined, activity on ammonia is possible given their metabolic and ecological context. The identification of an archaeal CuMMO outside of the Nitrososphaerales significantly expands the known diversity of CuMMO enzymes in archaea and suggests previously unaccounted organisms contribute to critical global nitrogen and/or carbon cycling functions.

TI  - Soil fauna precipitate the convergence of organic matter quality during decomposition
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Plant litter constitutes the dominant resource to soil food webs, which gradually decompose litter and transform it into soil organic matter. A central paradigm of this transformation posits that differences in quality between distinct litter types disappear during decomposition, as litter types converge towards similar physicochemical characteristics. Yet, this paradigm is debated and not based on clear metrics. It is also largely derived from microbial decomposition studies, while the effect of litter-feeding soil animals, by transforming large quantities of litter into faeces, remains poorly documented. We addressed this knowledge gap by quantifying the variability in physicochemical characteristics amongst leaf litter of six tree species of contrasting quality, before and after conversion into faeces by six soil animal species. We found that litter conversion into faeces by diverse soil animals largely reduced the variability in physical and chemical characteristics between contrasting litter types. We also evaluated the consequences of this animal-driven convergence on further microbial-driven convergence during decomposition, by decomposing intact litter and soil animal faeces and comparing the chemical characteristics of decomposed materials. Chemical variability amongst uningested litter and amongst soil animal faeces converged at similar rates. This indicates that animal- and microbial-driven convergence are additive, and that soil animals precipitate organic matter quality convergence during decomposition. We propose here a new framework and an associated metric to study changes in organic matter quality variability during decomposition, which we argue are essential for an improved understanding and modelling of litter decomposition and soil organic matter formation.

TI  - THE CARBON-CYCLE IN MEADOW ECOSYSTEMS
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - The structure of plant material and the biomass of soil organisms in the ecosystems of a floodplain catena and a mesophytic meadow were investigated. It was found that, in climax ecosystems, the input of organic matter to the soil is constant on average and equal to the net input of primary production. The microbial biomass, in spite of year-to-year and seasonal variations, also remains quite constant. Its magnitude is characteristic of a meadow ecosystem and depends on the amount of organic matter added to the soil annually.

TI  - Temperature and aridity regulate spatial variability of soil multifunctionality in drylands across the globe
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - The relationship between the spatial variability of soil multifunctionality (i.e., the capacity of soils to conduct multiple functions; SVM) and major climatic drivers, such as temperature and aridity, has never been assessed globally in terrestrial ecosystems. We surveyed 236 dryland ecosystems from six continents to evaluate the relative importance of aridity and mean annual temperature, and of other abiotic (e.g., texture) and biotic (e.g., plant cover) variables as drivers of SVM, calculated as the averaged coefficient of variation for multiple soil variables linked to nutrient stocks and cycling. We found that increases in temperature and aridity were globally correlated to increases in SVM. Some of these climatic effects on SVM were direct, but others were indirectly driven through reductions in the number of vegetation patches and increases in soil sand content. The predictive capacity of our structural equation modelling was clearly higher for the spatial variability of N- than for C- and P-related soil variables. In the case of N cycling, the effects of temperature and aridity were both direct and indirect via changes in soil properties. For C and P, the effect of climate was mainly indirect via changes in plant attributes. These results suggest that future changes in climate may decouple the spatial availability of these elements for plants and microbes in dryland soils. Our findings significantly advance our understanding of the patterns and mechanisms driving SVM in drylands across the globe, which is critical for predicting changes in ecosystem functioning in response to climate change.

TI  - Effects of activated carbon source on soil nitrogen content in three land use types in middle Guizhou, China, and the underlying mechanisms
T2  - CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE
AB  - Reducing fertilizer use while enhancing efficiency through microbial pathways is a promising approach for agricultural development. The application of an activated carbon source can influence soil nitrogen levels by modulating microbial communities; however, the responses of nitrogen cycle pathways to exogenous carbon sources remain unclear. This study examined soils from three land use types (paddy fields, dry land, and tea plantations) in Anshun, Guizhou, China. Field experiments were conducted using three application rates of activated carbon (glucose): 0.0, 5.0, and 10.0 g per kilogram of soil. The effects of glucose on soil physicochemical properties, microbiota composition, and nitrogen cycle-related genes were analyzed by assessing soil properties and 16S rDNA sequences. The results showed that, after the addition of glucose, the total nitrogen contents of the three types of soils were generally higher than those of the corresponding control treatments. Glucose addition significantly increased the relative abundances of Azotobacter in paddy field and dry land soils and Sporolactobacillus in tea plantation soil. Across all land use types, the highest relative abundance of nif genes was observed in soils treated with 10.0 g of glucose. Glucose application suppressed soil nitrification and promoted the reduction of assimilated nitrate, with effects proportional to the glucose load. In response to glucose addition, the relative abundances of denitrification pathway genes tended to increase in paddy field soil; these abundances exhibited minimal changes in dry land soil and significantly decreased in tea plantation soil. The above results suggest that, in different land use types, the addition of glucose can activate specific dominant nitrogen cycle microbial combinations, thereby regulating the nitrogen transformation rates in each land use type. These results provide theoretical and empirical support for understanding the impact and mechanisms of exogenous activated carbon on soil nitrogen content in Middle Guizhou, China, thereby offering insights and strategies for efficient nitrogen utilization in this region.

TI  - Selenium combined with chitin reduced phosphorus leaching in soil with pomelo by driving soil phosphorus cycle via microbial community
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Phosphorus leaching is severe in the orchard of Fujian province, especially in Pinghe where 'Guanximiyou' Pomelo is extensively grown. It triggers decreased phosphorus fertilizer utilization efficiency and causes eutrophication of waterways. Microorganisms can promote plant growth, mineralize organic phosphorus and solubilize inorganic phosphorus in soil. Here, metagenomics was used to explore the effects of selenium combined with chitin inputs on genes and microorganisms related to the soil phosphorous cycle. Phenotypic approaches were used to explore phosphorus accumulation in plants and the leaching of soil phosphorus from leaching column experiments. The results showed that compared with the control, the combination of selenium and chitin could significantly promote phosphorus accumulation in leaves by 33.3% and reduce the leaching of phosphorus from soil by 29.11%. Addition of selenium and chitin also changed the composition of microbial community, thus affecting the relative abundance of genes and microorganisms involved with phosphorus cycle. For example, the PstSAC protein which mediates phosphorus transport in soil phosphorus cycle increased in the current study. And it may promote microbes to immobilize more phosphorus in their biomass. These findings provide a strategy to reduce the loss of phosphorus from soil and lower the risks of eutrophication of waterways, which would contribute to a sustainable and environmental friendly agriculture.

TI  - Changes in soil microecology of gangue reclamation areas after 10 years of in situ restoration with herbaceous plants (Artemisia sacrorum and Imperata cylindrica) and trees (Populus spp.)
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Changes in the soil ecological microenvironment of coal gangue contaminated areas were evaluated after 10 years of in situ restoration with Artemisia sacrorum, Imperata cylindrica, and Populus spp. The changes in soil enzyme activity, ion spectrum, bacterial community structure and function, and metabolic spectrum were analyzed in an unrestored coal gangue pollution area (Control), an Artemisia sacrorum + Imperata cylindrica remediation area (T1), and a Populus remediation area (T2). Phytoremediation significantly increased the soil acid phosphatase activity by 4.62-7.36 times, and decreased the electrical conductivity by 6.2-85.5%. The overall reduction trend for heavy metals in the soil was shallow layer > middle layer > deep layer, with significant reductions seen for Cs, As, Co, Pb, Ni, U, and Cr. The number and diversity of shallow soil microbial communities increased significantly, with Actinobacteria, which participate in the carbon and nitrogen cycles, and Proteobacteria, which can tolerate/metabolize multiple heavy metals, becoming the dominant species in the restoration area. Microbial genes for glycosyltransferase, transcriptional regulators, and toluene degradation changed significantly. Phytoremediation by both remediation strategies significantly changed the metabolic level of lipids and lipid-like molecules in the soil, while significantly enriching the pathways of ABC transporters and galactose metabolism, which are essential for soil detoxification, ion transport, and carbon cycling. Bacteria such as Thiobacillus and Pseudarthrobacter were important drivers of soil metabolism. In general, the in situ phytoremediation of soil contaminated by coal gangue improved the overall soil ecological microenvironment.

TI  - Co-Occurrence Patterns of Soil Fungal and Bacterial Communities in Subtropical Forest-Transforming Areas
T2  - CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil microbial communities are engineers of important biogeochemical processes and play a critical role in regulating the functions and stability of forest ecosystem. However, few studies have assessed microbial interactions during forest conversion, which is essential to the understanding of the structure and function of soil microbiome. Herein, we investigated the co-occurrence network pattern and putative functions of fungal and bacterial communities in forest-transforming areas (five sites that cover the typical forests) using high-throughput sequencing of the ITS genes and 16S rRNA. Our study showed that the bacterial network had higher average connectivity and more links than fungal network, which might indicate that the bacterial community had more complex internal interactions compared with fungal one. Alphaproteobacteria_unclassfied, Telmatobacter, 0319-6A21 and Latescibacteria_unclassfied were the keystone taxa in bacterial network. For the fungal community network, the keystone taxon was Ceratobasidium. A structural equation model indicated that the available potassium and total organic carbon were important soil environmental factors, which affected all microbial modules, including bacterial and fungi. Total nitrogen had significant effects on the bacterial module that contains a relatively rich group of nitrogen cycling functions, and pH influenced the bacterial module which have higher potential functions of carbon cycling. And, more fungal modules were directly affected by forest structure (S Tree) compared with bacterial ones. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the feedback of underground creatures to forest conversion and highlights the importance of microbial modules in the nutrient cycling process.

TI  - Northern peatland carbon dynamics driven by plant growth form - the role of graminoids
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Plant growth forms can influence carbon cycling, particularly in carbon-rich ecosystems like northern peatlands; however, mechanistic evidence of this relationship is limited. Our aim was to determine if northern peatland plant growth forms alter belowground dissolved carbon chemistry and enhance carbon release through stimulated microbial metabolism.
   We used replicated, peat monoliths populated exclusively by Sphagnum mosses, graminoids, or bare peat and quantified changes in belowground dissolved organic carbon chemistry, microbial metabolism, as well as respired CO2.
   The graminoid growth form was significantly distinct in belowground dissolved organic carbon chemistry with carbon compound lability 20 % and 11 % greater than bare peat and Sphagnum moss respectively. The labile dissolved organic carbon stimulated the microbial community, as indicated by greater microbial metabolic activity and richness values in conjunction with 50 % higher respired CO2 fluxes under the graminoid treatment.
   Our results provide mechanistic evidence that peatland plant growth forms can drive carbon cycling processes by altering dissolved organic carbon chemistry to prompt cascading effects on the microbial community and carbon release - trends suggestive of microbial priming effects. Should climate change increase graminoid prevalence at the expense of Sphagnum moss northern peatland carbon store stability may be threatened by this mechanism.

TI  - Woody Plant-Soil Relationships in Interstitial Spaces Have Implications for Future Forests Within and Beyond Urban Areas
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Relatively unmanaged interstitial areas at the residential-wildland interface can support the development of novel woody plant communities. Community assembly processes in urban areas involve interactions between spontaneous and cultivated species pools that include native, introduced (exotic/non-native) and invasive species. The potential of these communities to spread under changing climate conditions has implications for the future trajectories of forests within and beyond urban areas. We quantified woody vegetation (including trees and shrubs) in relatively unmanaged "interstitial" areas at the residential-wildland interface and in exurban reference natural areas in six metropolitan regions across the continental USA. In addition, we analyzed soil N and C cycling processes to ensure that there were no major anthropogenic differences between reference and interstitial sites such as compaction, profile disturbance or fertilization, and to explore effects of novel plant communities on soil processes. We observed marked differences in woody plant community composition between interstitial and reference sites in most metropolitan regions. These differences appeared to be driven by the expanded species pool in urban areas. There were no obvious anthropogenic effects on soils, enabling us to determine that compositional differences between interstitial and reference areas were associated with variation in soil N availability. Our observations of the formation of novel communities in interstitial spaces in six cities across a very broad range of climates, suggest that our results have relevance for how forests within and beyond urban areas are assessed and managed to provide ecosystem services and resilience that rely on native biodiversity.

TI  - Bioremediation of dibutyl phthalate in a simulated agricultural ecosystem by Gordonia sp. strain QH-11 and the microbial ecological effects in soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Bioremediation of organic pollutants has been identified as an economically efficient and environmentally friendly method. Here, a pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the bioremediation efficiency of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) by Gordonia phthalatica sp. nov. QH-11 in agricultural soils, along with the effect of this exogenous organism on the native microbial community and ecosystem functions during the bioremediation process. The results showed that inoculation with strain QH-11 accelerated DBP degradation in the soil and decreased DBP accumulation in plants, thereby reducing the health risks associated with vegetables grown in those soils. Highthroughput sequencing demonstrated that both DBP contamination and the bioremediation process significantly altered prokaryotic community composition, structure, and network interactions; however, these effects were greatly reduced after 30 d. Dibutyl phthalate affected the prokaryotic community by influencing soil properties rather than directly impacting on microorganisms. In addition, ecosystem functions, like the nitrogen cycle, were significantly altered. Contamination with DBP promoted nitrogen fixation and the denitrification processes while inhibiting nitrification. Bioremediation may mitigate some of the changes to nitrogen cycling, helping to maintain the balance of prokaryotic community function. According to this study, bioremediation through highly efficient degradation bacteria may be a sale and promising method for reducing PAEs contamination in soilvegetable systems.

TI  - Carbon cycle in the microbial ecosystems of biological soil crusts
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The carbon cycle (C-cycle) is the most important and complex biogeochemical cycle in soil ecosystems, but our understanding of C-cycle at the community level remains limited. Biocrusts are known ecosystem engineers and represent ideal model systems for biogeochemical cycling studies. Here, metagenomic sequencing based on five repeated collections of four types of biocrusts revealed a low abundance of genes related to light-driven inorganic carbon fixation, and high abundance of genes related to the chemical energy-driven degradation of macromolecular organic carbon (OC), fermentation, aerobic respiration, and CO oxidation. For OC decomposition, genes mediating starch/glycogen and cellulose degradation were most abundant during the initial complex OC degradation, as were genes mediating fermentation during terminal steps of OC decomposition. To assess successional changes in carbon cycle, the metagenomic data were combined with absolute quantification via GeoChip, as well as key enzyme activity measurements. Inorganic carbon fixation, fermentation, CH4 oxidation, and both starch/glycogen and peptidoglycan degradation decreased during succession. However, several high efficiency processes, as well as CO oxidation and most types of OC degradation, increased. Co-occurrence networks revealed that C-cycle in biocrusts consists of an assimilation module, akin to primary production, and a dissimilation module, comparable to secondary production; dynamic changes in the relationships between C cycle pathways and microbial community composition occurred during succession. The two C-cycle modules were connected by the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, as well as ethanol and propionate fermentation; the modules were balanced by drought and salinity. Collectively, these results improve our understanding of C-cycle pathways and regulatory mechanisms in biocrust succession, and provide a basis for future multi-omics studies of these systems.

TI  - Impact of plant carbon inputs on soil bacterial communities and nitrogen cycle functions in temperate steppe
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsPlants influence soil microbial communities through aboveground litter and root inputs. However, studies on the effects of various plant carbon inputs on soil microbial communities in grassland ecosystems are limited.MethodsWe characterized bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing archaea using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantified the amoA gene via real-time PCR. We assessed the impacts of different carbon inputs (litter addition, litter removal, plant removal, and their interactions) on soil bacterial community structure, composition, nitrogen cycle functions, co-occurrence networks and assembly in a temperate grassland ecosystem following over a decade of experimental manipulations.ResultsPlant removal significantly affected soil total carbon content and the ratio of total carbon to total nitrogen content. The impact of plant removal was stronger than that of litter changes, significantly influencing bacterial community structure. Compared to ammonia-oxidizing archaea, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria dominated semi-arid grassland communities, and plant removal inhibited potential denitrification and nitrogen fixation groups. Notably, plant removal increased the complexity but reduced the stability of bacterial co-occurrence networks. It also enhanced deterministic processes and decreased the relative contribution of stochastic processes in bacterial communities.ConclusionsThis study elucidates the effects of various carbon input patterns on soil bacterial communities, highlighting their importance for comprehensively understanding the stability of these communities and their role in nitrogen cycling in temperate grasslands amid global change.

TI  - N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) in intertidal marsh: diversity and potential role in nitrogen cycling
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Aims N-acyl-L-homoserine lactones (AHLs) based quorum sensing (QS) phenomenon is recognized as an effective agent for regulating bacterial growth and metabolism. However, diversity and biological role of AHLs in natural environments remain largely unknown. This study focuses on compositions of AHLs and their potential role in nitrogen transformation in intertidal marshes. Methods We investigated the levels of AHLs in rhizosphere (Phragmites australis,Spartina alternifloraandScirpus mariqueter) and non-rhizosphere soils from Chongming eastern intertidal wetland of the Yangtze Estuary using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Molecular techniques were employed to investigate the compositions and structure of bacterial community. Soil-slurry experiments in combination with nitrogen isotope tracing technique were conducted to examine the effects of AHLs on nitrogen transformation processes. Results AHLs were higher in rhizosphere than non-rhizosphere soils, and correlated significantly with soil organic carbon and pH. C6-, C8-, C10- and C12-HSLs were identified as the probably universal QS signal molecules in intertidal marsh soils. The bacterial biodiversity might be regulated by AHLs, and 12 of the 50 most abundant microorganisms in intertidal marsh soils were related significantly with AHL concentrations. Furthermore, C6-, C8- and C12-HSLs might play an important role in mediating nitrogen transformation processes including nitrification, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Conclusions AHLs are favored to accumulate in rhizospheric environments and thus further mediate the bacterial diversity and soil nitrogen cycling. This study highlights the associations of QS signal molecules with the dynamics and activity of nitrogen cycling bacteria in intertidal marshes.

TI  - Identification of new microbial functional standards for soil quality assessment
T2  - SOIL
AB  - The activity of microorganisms in soil is important for a robust functioning of soil and related ecosystem services. Hence, there is a necessity to identify the composition, diversity, and function of the soil microbiome in order to determine its natural properties, functioning, and operating range as well as to assess eco-toxicological effects due to anthropogenic activities. Numerous microbiological methods currently exist in the literature and new, more advanced methods continue to be developed; however, only a limited number of these methods are standardised. Consequently, there is a need to identify the most promising non-standardised methods for assessing soil quality and to transform them into standards. In agreement with the "Ecosystem Service Approach", new methods should focus more on soil microbial functions, including nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emission, pest control and plant growth promotion, carbon cycling and sequestration, as well as soil structure development and filter function. The few existing standardised methods available that focus on the function of the soil microbiome mostly include measurements, like basal respiration, enzyme activities, and biodegradation of organic matter, under well-defined conditions in the lab. This paper sets out to summarise and expand on recent discussions within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Soil Quality - Biological Characterization sub-committee (ISO TC 190/SC 4), where a need was identified to develop scientifically sound methods which would best fulfil the practical needs of future users for assessing soil quality, going beyond the existing test systems. Of particular note is the current evolution of molecular methods in microbial ecology that use quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to produce a large number of new functional endpoints which are more sensitive as compared to "classical" methods. Quantitative PCR assesses the abundance of microbes that catalyse major transformation steps in nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, chemical transformations including pesticide degradation, and plant growth promotion pathways based on the assessment of marker gene sequences that drive the related processes. In the assessment of soil quality methods, it was found that most methods focus on bacteria and related endpoints. Techniques to describe fungal communities as well as their functional traits are far less represented. As such, techniques to analyse fungal enzyme activities are proposed. Additionally, methods for the determination of microbial growth rates and efficiencies, including the use of glomalin as a biochemical marker for soil aggregation, are discussed. Furthermore, field methods indicative of carbon turnover, including the litter bag test and a modification to the tea bag test, are presented. However, it is obvious that with increasing developments in high throughput sequencing technologies and big data analyses, including metagenomics analysis, it will be possible to implement these technologies into the standardisation process for assessing the functions of the soil microbiome. Overall, it is suggested that endpoints should represent a potential function of soil microorganisms rather than actual activity levels, as the latter can largely be dependent on short-term variable soil properties such as pedoclimatic conditions, nutrient availability, and anthropogenic soil cultivation activities.

TI  - Distribution of carbon and nitrogen cycle microbes along permafrost peatland profile in Northeast China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
AB  - Microorganisms play critical roles in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. However, our understanding of the distribution of C- and N-cycling microbial communities along the permafrost peatland profile was limited. We characterized changes in the abundances of bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, methanotroph, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria along a soil profile in the permafrost peatland of the Great Hing'an Mountains, China. Maximum values of bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanotroph, and nirK-type denitrifying bacteria abundances were found for the 0-40 cm layer and minimum values for the 100-150 cm layer. Bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanotroph, and nirK-type denitrifying bacteria gradually decreased in terms of abundance with increasing soil depths. Methanogen, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria all showed the highest abundances in the 40-80 cm layer. Abundances of bacteria, fungi, archaea, methanogen, methanotroph, and nirK-type denitrifying bacteria were all significantly negatively correlated with pH and C:N values, but significantly positively correlated with TC, TN, and TP levels. In the context of climate change, microbial distribution characteristics in the active, transition, and frozen layers in permafrost peatlands will change, and then affect C and N cycles. Results in this study highlighted the importance of sampling deeper soil depths in the study of microbial distribution and C/N cycles in peatland ecosystems.

TI  - Effect of freezing and thawing on available phosphorus content of soil
T2  - 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AIR POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Air Pollution and Environmental Engineering (APEE)
AB  - The process of freeze-thaw not only directly affects the phosphorus cycle in non growing season, but also shows that the impact of cold winter and frequent freeze-thaw on the ecosystem will continue to the following growing season. This effect is closely related to soil properties, microbial activity and community structure, climate conditions, vegetation composition and management methods. However, due to the differences in research methods, many results about the effects of freeze-thaw on soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycle are quite different. After the freeze-thaw cycle, the content of available phosphorus in the two soils decreased, and the decreasing trend was Lou soil > arsenic sandstone.

TI  - Nitrogen cycling mediated by biological soil crusts and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Plants in terrestrial systems obtain nitrogen primarily by root uptake from soil, yet current models of ecosystem nitrogen cycling assume little interaction of plant roots with the soil microbial community. The objective of this study was to determine how soil microorganisms in biological soil crusts interact with herbaceous plants for nitrogen in a pyrogenic ecosystem in Florida (USA), using a combination of natural abundance and tracer isotope methods. I demonstrate that plant nitrogen is strongly affected by interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and biological soil crusts. Measurements of nitrogenase activity indicated a high capacity of crusts to fix nitrogen that dramatically decreased after disturbance. Natural abundance of delta(15)N differed between arbuscular mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal herbs. When a small amount of enriched nitrogen was used as a tracer, crusts initially captured a greater amount of the N-15 that was added compared to plants, with some turnover of nitrogen from the crusts to plants observed after 15 days. Observations in this study indicate that crusts have more than one function in nitrogen dynamics: cyanobacteria in crusts fix nitrogen, crusts retain nitrogen in the system that would otherwise be lost to leaching. and though some of this nitrogen is available to plants, they also face competition from heterotrophic bacteria in crusts.

TI  - Herbivore absence can shift dry heath tundra from carbon source to sink during peak growing season
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - In arctic tundra, large and small mammalian herbivores have substantial impacts on the vegetation community and consequently can affect the magnitude of carbon cycling. However, herbivores are often absent from modern carbon cycle models, partly because relatively few field studies focus on herbivore impacts on carbon cycling. Our objectives were to quantify the impact of 21 years of large herbivore and large and small herbivore exclusion on carbon cycling during peak growing season in a dry heath tundra community. When herbivores were excluded, we observed a significantly greater leaf area index as well as greater vascular plant abundance. While we did not observe significant differences in deciduous dwarf shrub abundance across treatments, evergreen dwarf shrub abundance was greater where large and small herbivores were excluded. Both foliose and fruticose lichen abundance were higher in the large herbivore, but not the small and large herbivore exclosures. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) likewise indicated the highest carbon uptake in the exclosure treatments and lowest uptake in the control (CT), suggesting that herbivory decreased the capacity of dry heath tundra to take up carbon. Moreover, our calculated NEE for average light and temperature conditions for July 2017, when our measurements were taken, indicated that the tundra was a carbon source in CT, but was a carbon sink in both exclosure treatments, indicating removal of grazing pressure can change the carbon balance of dry heath tundra. Collectively, these findings suggest that herbivore absence can lead to changes in plant community structure of dry heath tundra that in turn can increase its capacity to take up carbon.

TI  - Life in the dark: Impact of future winter warming scenarios on carbon and nitrogen cycling in Arctic soils
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The high Arctic region is warming faster than other areas globally, with widespread decreases in snow cover and longer growing seasons. This is expected to greatly influence plant-microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling and thus ecosystem functioning, particularly when soils remain unfrozen during the dark winter period and no photosynthesis is possible. To better understand this response, we studied the effects of different winter warming scenarios on soil C and N dynamics. We collected intact soils cores from two contrasting biomes from Svalbard, namely a moss-dominated peat mire and purple saxifrage-dominated dry tundra heath. In the laboratory, we used an Arctic annual light regime and three contrasting winter temperature regimes to simulate a range of climate scenarios: (i) current climate in which the soils were frozen in winter and thawed in the summer, (ii) a year 2050 regime in which the soils were both frozen and thawed in winter, and (iii) a year 2100 regime in which the soils remained unfrozen during winter. We monitored greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2, CH4 and N2O) and nutrients in soil solution (DOC, NO3 , NH4+, P) over a one-year period. In the peat mire, warmer winters increased CO2 emissions due to increased microbial activity but had little effect on methane or N2O fluxes. Warmer winters also decreased dissolved organic carbon and nutrients in soil solution. In the dry tundra heath, warmer winters increased nitrate availability but did not greatly alter CO2, CH4 or N2O gas fluxes or other nutrients. Warming in the dry tundra health induced earlier spring flowering and shifts in vegetation compo-sition. Overall, we present clear evidence that warmer winter conditions are likely to alter C and N cycling in Arctic soils, with implications for plant productivity and vegetation community composition.

TI  - A High Arctic soil ecosystem resists long-term environmental manipulations
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - We evaluated above- and belowground ecosystem changes in a 16 year, combined fertilization and warming experiment in a High Arctic tundra deciduous shrub heath (Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island, NU, Canada). Soil emissions of the three key greenhouse gases (GHGs) (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) were measured in mid-July 2009 using soil respiration chambers attached to a FTIR system. Soil chemical and biochemical properties including Q(10) values for CO2, CH4, and N2O, Bacteria and Archaea assemblage composition, and the diversity and prevalence of key nitrogen cycling genes including bacterial amoA, crenarchaeal amoA, and nosZ were measured. Warming and fertilization caused strong increases in plant community cover and height but had limited effects on GHG fluxes and no substantial effect on soil chemistry or biochemistry. Similarly, there was a surprising lack of directional shifts in the soil microbial community as a whole or any change at all in microbial functional groups associated with CH4 consumption or N2O cycling in any treatment. Thus, it appears that while warming and increased nutrient availability have strongly affected the plant community over the last 16 years, the belowground ecosystem has not yet responded. This resistance of the soil ecosystem has resulted in limited changes in GHG fluxes in response to the experimental treatments.

TI  - Manipulating rhizosphere microorganisms to improve crop yield in saline-alkali soil: a study on soybean growth and development
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionRhizosphere microorganisms can effectively promote the stress resistance of plants, and some beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms can significantly promote the growth of crops under salt stress, which has the potential to develop special microbial fertilizers for increasing the yield of saline-alkali land and provides a low-cost and environmentally friendly new strategy for improving the crop yield of saline-alkali cultivated land by using agricultural microbial technology.MethodsIn May 2022, a field study in a completely randomized block design was conducted at the Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences to explore the correlation between plant rhizosphere microorganisms and soybean growth in saline-alkali soil. Two soybean cultivars (Hening 531, a salt-tolerant variety, and 20_1846, a salt-sensitive variety) were planted at two experimental sites [Daqing (normal condition) and Harbin (saline-alkali conditions)], aiming to investigate the performance of soybean in saline-alkali environments.ResultsSoybeans grown in saline-alkali soil showed substantial reductions in key traits: plant height (25%), pod number (26.6%), seed yield (33%), and 100 seed weight (13%). This underscores the unsuitability of this soil type for soybean cultivation. Additionally, microbial analysis revealed 43 depleted and 56 enriched operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the saline-alkali soil compared to normal soil. Furthermore, an analysis of ion-associated microbes identified 85 mOTUs with significant correlations with various ions. A co-occurrence network analysis revealed strong relationships between specific mOTUs and ions, such as Proteobacteria with multiple ions. In addition, the study investigated the differences in rhizosphere species between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive soybean varieties under saline-alkali soil conditions. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that mOTUs in saline-alkali soil were associated with pH and ions, while mOTUs in normal soil were correlated with Ca2+ and K+. Comparative analyses identified significant differences in mOTUs between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive varieties under both saline-alkali and normal soil conditions. Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were dominant in the bacterial community of saline-alkali soil, with significant enrichment compared to normal soil. The study explored the functioning of the soybean rhizosphere key microbiome by comparing metagenomic data to four databases related to the carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles. A total of 141 KOs (KEGG orthologues) were identified, with 66 KOs related to the carbon cycle, 16 KOs related to the nitrogen cycle, 48 KOs associated with the phosphorus cycle, and 11 KOs linked to the sulfur cycle. Significant correlations were found between specific mOTUs, functional genes, and phenotypic traits, including per mu yield (PMY), grain weight, and effective pod number per plant.ConclusionOverall, this study provides comprehensive insights into the structure, function, and salt-related species of soil microorganisms in saline-alkali soil and their associations with salt tolerance and soybean phenotype. The identification of key microbial species and functional categories offers valuable information for understanding the mechanisms underlying plant-microbe interactions in challenging soil conditions.

TI  - Multiceutury changes to the global climate and carbon cycle: Results from a coupled climate and carbon cycle model
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
AB  - A coupled climate and carbon (CO2) cycle model is used to investigate the global climate and carbon cycle changes out to the year 2300 that would occur if CO2 emissions from all the currently estimated fossil fuel resources were released to the atmosphere. By the year 2300, the global climate warms by about 8 K and atmospheric CO2 reaches 1423 ppmv. The warming is higher than anticipated because the sensitivity to radiative forcing increases as the simulation progresses. In this simulation, the rate of emissions peaks at over 30 Pg C yr(-1) early in the twenty-second century. Even at the year 2300, nearly 50% of cumulative emissions remain in the atmosphere. Both soils and living biomass are net carbon sinks throughout the simulation. Despite having relatively low climate sensitivity and strong carbon uptake by the land biosphere, these model projections suggest severe long-term consequences for global climate if all the fossil fuel carbon is ultimately released into the atmosphere.

TI  - Nitrogen Cycling and Mass Balance in the World's Mangrove Forests
T2  - NITROGEN
AB  - Nitrogen (N) cycling in mangroves is complex, with rapid turnover of low dissolved N concentrations, but slow turnover of particulate N. Most N is stored in soils. The largest sources of N are nearly equal amounts of mangrove and benthic microalgal primary production. Dissolved N fluxes between the forests and tidal waters show net uptake, indicating N conservation. N2-fixation is underestimated as rapid rates measured on tree stems, aboveground roots and cyanobacterial mats cannot currently be accounted for at the whole-forest scale due to their extreme patchiness and the inability to extrapolate beyond a localized area. Net immobilization of NH4+ is the largest ecosystem flux, indicating N retention. Denitrification is the largest loss of N, equating to 35% of total N input. Burial equates to about 29% of total inputs and is the second largest loss of N. Total inputs slightly exceed total outputs, currently suggesting net N balance in mangroves. Mangrove PON export equates to approximate to 95% of PON export from the world's tropical rivers, but only 1.5% of the entire world's river discharge. Mangrove N2O emissions, denitrification, and burial contribute 0.4%, 0.5-2.0% and 6%, respectively, to the global coastal ocean, which are disproportionate to their small worldwide area.

TI  - Microbial Activity in a Temperate Forest Soil as Affected by Elevated Atmospheric CO2
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
AB  - Microorganisms play a key role in the response of soil ecosystems to the rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) as they mineralize organic matter and drive nutrient cycling. To assess the effects of elevated CO2 on soil microbial C and N immobilization and on soil enzyme activities, in years 8 (2006) and 9 (2007) of an open-top chamber experiment that begun in spring of 1999, soil was sampled in summer, and microbial biomass and enzyme activity related to the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling were measured. Although no effects on microbial biomass C were detected, changes in microbial biomass N and metabolic activity involving C, N and P were observed under elevated CO2. Invertase and dehydrogenase activities were significantly enhanced by different degrees of elevated CO2. Nitrifying enzyme activity was significantly (P < 0.01) increased in the August 2006 samples that received the elevated CO2 treatment, as compared to the samples that received the ambient treatment. Denitrifying enzyme activity was significantly (P < 0.04) decreased by elevated CO2 treatments in the August 2006 and June 2007 (P < 0.09) samples.) beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity was increased under elevated CO2 by 7% and 25% in June and August 2006, respectively, compared to those under ambient CO2. The results of June 2006 samples showed that acid phosphatase activity was significantly enhanced under elevated CO2. Overall, these results suggested that elevated CO2 might cause changes in the belowground C, N and P cycling in temperate forest soils.

TI  - Distinct temporal diversity profiles for nitrogen cycling genes in a hyporheic microbiome
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Biodiversity is thought to prevent decline in community function in response to changing environmental conditions through replacement of organisms with similar functional capacity but different optimal growth characteristics. We examined how this concept translates to the within-gene level by exploring seasonal dynamics of within-gene diversity for genes involved in nitrogen cycling in hyporheic zone communities. Nitrification genes displayed low richness-defined as the number of unique within-gene phylotypes-across seasons. Conversely, denitrification genes varied in both richness and the degree to which phylotypes were recruited or lost. These results demonstrate that there is not a universal mechanism for maintaining community functional potential for nitrogen cycling activities, even across seasonal environmental shifts to which communities would be expected to be well adapted. As such, extreme environmental changes could have very different effects on the stability of the different nitrogen cycle activities. These outcomes suggest a need to modify existing conceptual models that link biodiversity to microbiome function to incorporate within-gene diversity. Specifically, we suggest an expanded conceptualization that 1) recognizes component steps (genes) with low diversity as potential bottlenecks influencing pathway-level function, and 2) includes variation in both the number of entities (e.g. species, phylotypes) that can contribute to a given process and the turnover of those entities in response to shifting conditions. Building these concepts into process-based ecosystem models represents an exciting opportunity to connect within-gene-scale ecological dynamics to ecosystem-scale services.

TI  - Mixed and continuous cropping eucalyptus plantation facilitated soil carbon cycling and fungal community diversity after a 14-year field trail
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
AB  - The large-scale cultivation of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus) globally has led to soil degradation and a reduction in microbial diversity. To address this challenge, mixed eucalyptus plantations have been proposed, yet their impact on fungal communities and soil carbon cycling remain poorly understood. This study investigated soil enzyme activity, fungal communities, and carbon cycling-related genes in two management models of eucalyptus plantations (continuous cropping and mixed eucalyptus with nitrogen-fixing trees) over a 14-year period. The results revealed that mixed plantation led to a decrease in soil beta-glucosidase activity, which in turn facilitated the accumulation of microbial biomass carbon. Both mixed and continuous cropping eucalyptus plantation exhibited higher fungal diversity and richness, along with a higher number of unique fungal species. The fungal community and functional gene structures in mixed and continuous cropping plantations significantly differed from the pure and first-generation plantations, respectively. Additionally, fungal network in mixed and continuous cropping eucalyptus plantation showed greater complexity and stability. Notably, mixed plantation increased the abundance of Cladophialophora genus. Interestingly, a negative correlation was found between fungal amplicon sequence variant (ASVs) and microbial carbon content, as well as beta-Xylosidase, with 72 ASVs exhibiting a significant negative correlation. Furthermore, both mixed and continuous cropping plantations elevated the abundance of genes associated with methane metabolism, carbon fixation and carbon degradation. This study underscores the importance of continuous cropping and mixing with nitrogen-fixing tree species, in plantation management to enhance soil carbon cycling and promote diverse fungal communities. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing eucalyptus plantation strategies to improve soil health and enhance microbial diversity.

TI  - The effect of Torreya grandis inter-cropping with Polygonatum sibiricum on soil microbial community
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Background Inter-cropping is a reasonable planting pattern between different plants. Inter-cropping of Torreya grandis with Polygonatum sibiricum is a relatively mature planting pattern in China, which has been applied to improve soil ecological environment and reduce the occurrence of pests and diseases in China. However, there is currently limited knowledge on the response of soil microbial communities to this practice. Methods In this study, we employed Illumina MiSeq sequencing coupled with Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) and Fungi Functional Guild (FUNGuild) analyses to investigate the dynamic changes in soil microbial communities across seven treated groups [the bulk soil of the T. grandis inter-cropping with P. sibiricum (IB), the bulk soil for mono-cropping of P. sibiricum (PB), the bulk soil for mono-cropping of T. grandis (TB), the P. grandis rhizosphere soil of the T. grandis inter-cropping with P. sibiricum (IPR), the rhizosphere soil for mono-cropping of P. sibiricum (PR), the T. grandis rhizosphere soil of the T. grandis inter-cropping with P. sibiricum (ITR), and the rhizosphere soil for mono-cropping of T. grandis (TR)]. Results The results showed that the rhizosphere soil of Torreya-Polygonatum inter-cropping exhibited higher microbial community richness, diversity and evenness than mono-cropping (ITR > TR, IPR > PR). Inter-cropping increased the abundance of Micrococcaceae, Xanthobacteraceae, Saitozyma, while decreased Bacillus, Burkholderia, Streptomyces, Cladosporium, and Gibberella significantly of the rhizosphere soil of T. grandis. Further, the abundance of pathogens, such as Fusarium and Neocosmospora, was higher in mono-cropping samples compared to inter-cropping. There existed distinct variations in bacterial and fungal communities among all groups except for IB and TB. The FAPROTAX and FUNGuild analyses results indicated that inter-cropping significantly enhanced soil microbial function associated with nutrient cycling and exhibited a consistent increase in the relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling and carbon-cycling bacteria, and decreased the abundance of plant pathogen guild in the inter-cropping sample ITR compared to the mono-cropping TR. Conclusion Our findings suggest that T. grandis inter-cropping with P. sibiricum not only enhance the diversity of soil microbial communities, but also improve the nitrogen and carbon cycling functions. In addition, the inter-cropping can effectively reduce the relative abundance of some soil-borne pathogens for T. grandis and P. sibiricum, indicating that this intercropping method may alleviate the impact of pathogens on crops, thus providing assistance for plant disease prevention and sustainable management.

TI  - Fungal diversity in peatlands and its contribution to carbon cycling
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Peatlands are major carbon sinks globally, but it is still unclear what drives their shift from functioning as carbon sink to a source. Fungi rely on soil carbon inputs and play an active role in carbon mobilization and stabilization. Future climate change scenarios predict increases in temperature and lower water tables, which may lead to functional shifts in fungal communities growing in peatlands. Despite their abundance, the impact of fungi on carbon cycling in peatlands is still poorly understood. Therefore, it is crucial to study the dynamics and distribution of fungal communities in pristine peatlands in order to predict the potential changes in peatland ecosystems more accurately. Here, we review the current knowledge about fungal communities in peatlands, including the influence of peatland type, abiotic factors, and temporal and spatial dynamics on fungal diversity. Our overview shows that fungal diversity in peatlands of certain regions such as tropical areas is severely understudied. Furthermore, we examine the ecological roles and the relative contribution to carbon cycling of functional guilds of fungi in peatlands, showing that saprotrophs are the key guild in organic matter decomposition, and ericoid- and ectomycorrhizal fungi have the ability to act as decomposers and vectors of plant carbon input to soil. We suggest that the application of a combination of methodological approaches for taxonomic and functional characterisation of peatland fungal communities is needed to build better understanding about the diversity-functioning relationships in peatland ecosystems. Overall, this review shows that fungi must be considered as important drivers of mechanistic processes underlying biodiversity, plant nutrient uptake and carbon losses in peatlands.

TI  - Interactions between earthworms and mesofauna has no significant effect on emissions of CO2 and N2O from soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil fauna can significantly affect soil CO2 and N2O emissions, but little is known about interactions between faunal groups and their relative contribution to such emissions. Over a 64-day microcosm incubation, we studied the effects of an epigeic earthworm (Eisenia fetida), mesofauna (Collembola plus oribatid mites) and their combinations on soil CO2 and N2O emissions under two faunal densities. Earthworms significantly enhanced soil CO2 and N2O emissions, while mesofauna only increased N2O emissions. Soil CO2 and N2O emissions were significantly affected by earthworm density, but not by mesofauna density. No significant interactive effects between earthworms and mesofauna were found on soil CO2 and N2O emissions. Our results indicate that earthworms probably play the dominant roles in determining soil CO2 and N2O emissions where they coexist with soil mesofauna. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nitrogen Availability and Changes in Precipitation Alter Microbially Mediated NO and N2O Emissions From a Pinyon-Juniper Dryland
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Climate change is altering precipitation regimes that control nitrogen (N) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. In ecosystems exposed to frequent drought, N can accumulate in soils as they dry, stimulating the emission of both nitric oxide (NO; an air pollutant at high concentrations) and nitrous oxide (N2O; a powerful greenhouse gas) when the dry soils wet up. Because changes in both N availability and soil moisture can alter the capacity of nitrifying organisms such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) to process N and emit N gases, predicting whether shifts in precipitation may alter NO and N2O emissions requires understanding how both AOA and AOB may respond. Thus, we ask: How does altering summer and winter precipitation affect nitrifier-derived N trace gas emissions in a dryland ecosystem? To answer this question, we manipulated summer and winter precipitation and measured AOA- and AOB-derived N trace gas emissions, AOA and AOB abundance, and soil N concentrations. We found that excluding summer precipitation increased AOB-derived NO emissions, consistent with the increase in soil N availability, and that increasing summer precipitation amount promoted AOB activity. Excluding precipitation in the winter (the most extreme water limitation we imposed) did not alter nitrifier-derived NO emissions despite N accumulating in soils. Instead, nitrate that accumulated under drought correlated with high N2O emission via denitrification upon wetting dry soils. Increases in the timing and intensity of precipitation that are forecasted under climate change may, therefore, influence the emission of N gases according to the magnitude and season during which the changes occur.

TI  - Effect of peat quality on microbial greenhouse gas formation in an acidic fen
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Peatlands play an important role in the global carbon cycle and represent both an important stock of soil carbon and a substantial natural source of relevant greenhouse gases like CO2 and CH4. While it is known that the quality of organic matter affects microbial degradation and mineralization processes in peatlands, the manner in which the quality of peat organic matter affects the formation of CO2 and CH4 remains unclear. In this study we developed a fast and simple peat quality index in order to estimate its potential greenhouse gas formation by linking the thermo-degradability of peat with potential anaerobic CO2 and CH4 formation rates. Peat samples were obtained at several depths (0-40 cm) at four sampling locations from an acidic fen (pH 4.7). CO2 and CH4 formation rates were highly spatially variable and depended on depth, sampling location, and the composition of pyrolysable organic matter. Peat samples active in CO2 and CH4 formation had a quality index above 1.35, and the fraction of thermally labile pyrolyzable organic matter (comparable to easily available carbon substrates for microbial activity) obtained by thermogravimetry was above 35%. Curie-point pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry mainly identified carbohydrates and lignin as pyrolysis products in these samples, indicating that undecomposed organic matter was found in this fraction. In contrast, lipids and unspecific pyrolysis products, which indicate recalcitrant and highly decomposed organic matter, correlated significantly with lower CO2 formation and reduced methanogenesis. Our results suggest that undecomposed organic matter is a prerequisite for CH4 and CO2 development in acidic fens. Furthermore, the new peat quality index should aide the estimation of potential greenhouse gas formation resulting from peatland restoration and permafrost thawing and help yield more robust models of trace gas fluxes from peatlands for climate change research.

TI  - Stimulated soil CO 2 and CH 4 emissions by microplastics: A hierarchical perspective
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Microplastics have become ubiquitous in soils on a global scale, which may elicit profound deleterious impacts on soil health. However, contradictory case studies have prevented a clear understanding of how microplastics hierarchically impact soil carbon cycling. A meta-analysis was performed to systematically elucidate the effects of microplastics on carbon cycling, particularly in terms of CO 2 and CH 4 emissions. Upon exposure to microplastics, the overall soil CO 2 emissions increased by 54.3%, as were the soil organic carbon (22.6%), dissolved organic carbon (13.3%), and microbial biomass carbon (5.5%). Sufficient carbon substrates supported the replication of functional genes that governed the decomposition of carbon (4.0%; e.g., abfA , sga , and manB , etc.), whereas the gene copies for carbon fixation ( accA and pccA ) were negligibly affected. Moreover, soil enzymatic (e.g., dehydrogenase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolase, and chitinase) activities were also enhanced. Meanwhile, the CO 2 emissions were positively correlated with the gene copy numbers of carbon-decomposing microorganisms. Similarly, the soil CH 4 emissions increased by 9.7%, where the increment of methanogen (41.1%; mcrA ) was slightly higher than that of methanotrophs (37.9%; pmoA , mmoX and mxaF ). Moreover, CH 4 emissions were positively correlated with methanogen gene copies, and the increment of CH 4 emissions was more pronounced in paddy soil (11.3%) than in upland soil. Microplastics with smaller dimensions, round shapes, higher concentrations, and biodegradability leaded to higher soil CO 2 and CH 4 emissions. Meanwhile, the effect sizes of CO 2 and CH 4 emissions decreased over time. These findings revealed that soil carbon cycling was expedited following microplastics exposure, which should be factored into future environmental risk assessments.

TI  - Quantifying global N2O emissions from natural ecosystem soils using trait-based biogeochemistry models
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - A group of soil microbes plays an important role in nitrogen cycling and N2O emissions from natural ecosystem soils. We developed a trait-based biogeochemical model based on an extant process-based biogeochemistry model, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM), by incorporating the detailed microbial physiological processes of nitrification. The effect of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) was considered in modeling nitrification. Microbial traits, including microbial biomass and density, were explicitly considered. In addition, nitrogen cycling was coupled with carbon dynamics based on stoichiometry theory between carbon and nitrogen. The model was parameterized using observational data and then applied to quantifying global N2O emissions from global terrestrial ecosystem soils from 1990 to 2000. Our estimates of 8.7 +/- 1.6 Tg N yr(-1) generally agreed with previous estimates during the study period. Tropical forests are a major emitter, accounting for 42% of the global emissions. The model was more sensitive to temperature and precipitation and less sensitive to soil organic carbon and nitrogen contents. Compared to the model without considering the detailed microbial activities, the new model shows more variations in response to seasonal changes in climate. Our study suggests that further information on microbial diversity and ecophysiology features is needed. The more specific guilds and their traits shall be considered in future soil N2O emission quantifications.

TI  - Root-associated bacteria strengthen their community stability against disturbance of antibiotics on structure and functions
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Antibiotics affect bacterial community structure and functions in soil. However, the response and adaptation of root-associated bacterial communities to antibiotic stress remains poorly understood. Here, rhizobox experiments were conducted with maize (Zea mays L.) upon exposure to antibiotics ciprofloxacin or tetracycline. Highthroughput sequencing analysis of bacterial community and quantitative PCR analysis of nitrogen cycling genes show that ciprofloxacin and tetracycline significantly shift bacterial community structure in bulk soil, whereas plant host may mitigate the disturbances of antibiotics on bacterial communities in root-associated niches (i.e., rhizosphere and rhizoplane) through the community stabilization. Deterministic assembly, microbial interaction, and keystone species (e.g., Rhizobium and Massilia) of root-associated bacterial communities benefit the community stability compared with those in bulk soil. Meanwhile, the rhizosphere increases antibiotic dissipation, potentially reducing the impacts of antibiotics on root-associated bacterial communities. Furthermore, rhizospheric effects deriving from root exudates alleviate the impacts of antibiotics on the nitrogen cycle (i.e.,nitrification, organic nitrogen conversion and denitrification) as confirmed by functional gene quantification, which is largely attributed to the bacterial community stability in rhizosphere. The present study enhances the understanding on the response and adaptation of root -associated bacterial community to antibiotic pollution.

TI  - Effects of Ecosystem Recovery Types on Soil Phosphorus Bioavailability, Roles of Plant and Microbial Diversity: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Strategies for restoring degraded ecosystems vary widely in the levels of human intervention. It has commonly been assumed that recovery with artificial inputs would be quicker and more efficient. However, is this truly the situation? We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the differences and applicability between ecological restoration and ecological rehabilitation. Relationships between soil phosphorus content, plant diversity, and soil microbial diversity were analyzed using 463 valid experimental data points collected from 72 publications. The results indicated that in grassland ecosystems, ecological restoration outperformed rehabilitation by 35%, 68%, 38%, and 48% in belowground biomass, community coverage, plant richness, and Shannon diversity, respectively. In forests, rehabilitation trailed behind restoration by 58%, 26%, and 92% in belowground biomass, Simpson diversity, and bacterial Shannon diversity. Furthermore, there was minimal difference in the recovery mode among different fungal and bacterial phyla. Rehabilitation demonstrated lower stability and efficiency in long-term phosphorus cycling compared to restoration. Overall, ecological restoration offers more stable and efficient long-term phosphorus cycling, thereby questioning the effectiveness of ecological rehabilitation for sustainable ecosystem recovery, especially for species diversity and phosphorus cycling.

TI  - Biological soil crusts and wetting events: Effects on soil N and C cycles
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Biological soil crust (BSC) communities control many functional processes in arid and semiarid ecosystems, where biological activity is closely influenced by soil wetting. Our goal was to analyze how the length of wetting events and the presence of BSC determine soil variables related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in a semiarid ecosystem. We applied three watering treatments (one, six and ten days) on soils from two microsites (BSC and bare ground) in a microcosm experiment. We analyzed multiple variables related to N and C cycling (N in microbial biomass [MB-N], dissolved organic nitrogen [DON], NH4+-N, N--N, resin-NH4+-N and resin-NO3--N, phenols and carbohydrates). For all treatments, minimum DON concentration appeared earlier in BSC than in bare ground, while maximum NO3- peaks appeared earlier in BSC than in the bare ground. Increases of NH4+ were only perceptible under BSC. Our results showed that longer lasting wetting events kept higher mineral and organic N as well as labile organic C in soils under BSC, which suggest that longer wetting events may be related to an enhancement in the decomposition rate that compensate for nutrient losses associated to short lasting wetting events. This trend is much less obvious in bare ground than under BSC. Our data suggest that changes in the length of wetting events and the presence of BSC with climate changes could alter future soil community structure and function. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While its decomposition rate is primarily determined by biochemical composition, how traits such as melanin content affect the structure of necromass decomposer communities remains poorly understood.
   2. To assess the role of biochemical traits on microbial decomposer community composition and functioning, we incubated melanized and non-melanized necromass of the mycorrhizal fungus Meliniomyces bicolor in Pinus-and Quercus-dominated forests in Minnesota, USA and then assessed the associated fungal and bacterial decomposer communities after 1, 2 and 3 months using high-throughput sequencing.
   3. Melanized necromass decomposed significantly slower than non-melanized necromass in both forests. The structure of the microbial decomposer communities depended significantly on necromass melanin content, although the effect was stronger for fungi than bacteria. On non-melanized necromass, fungal communities were dominated by r-selected ascomycete and mucoromycete microfungi early and then replaced by basidiomycete ectomycorrhizal fungi, while on melanized necromass these groups were co-dominant throughout the incubation. Bacterial communities were dominated by both specialist mycophageous and generalist taxa.
   4. Synthesis. Our results indicate that necromass biochemistry not only strongly affects rates of decomposition but also the structure of the associated decomposer communities. Furthermore, the observed colonization patterns suggest that fungi, and particularly ectomycorrhizal fungi, may play a more important role in necromass decomposition than previously recognized.

TI  - The linkages between photosynthesis, productivity, growth and biomass in lowland Amazonian forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the relationship between photosynthesis, net primary productivity and growth in forest ecosystems is key to understanding how these ecosystems will respond to global anthropogenic change, yet the linkages among these components are rarely explored in detail. We provide the first comprehensive description of the productivity, respiration and carbon allocation of contrasting lowland Amazonian forests spanning gradients in seasonal water deficit and soil fertility. Using the largest data set assembled to date, ten sites in three countries all studied with a standardized methodology, we find that (i) gross primary productivity (GPP) has a simple relationship with seasonal water deficit, but that (ii) site-to-site variations in GPP have little power in explaining site-to-site spatial variations in net primary productivity (NPP) or growth because of concomitant changes in carbon use efficiency (CUE), and conversely, the woody growth rate of a tropical forest is a very poor proxy for its productivity. Moreover, (iii) spatial patterns of biomass are much more driven by patterns of residence times (i.e. tree mortality rates) than by spatial variation in productivity or tree growth. Current theory and models of tropical forest carbon cycling under projected scenarios of global atmospheric change can benefit from advancing beyond a focus on GPP. By improving our understanding of poorly understood processes such as CUE, NPP allocation and biomass turnover times, we can provide more complete and mechanistic approaches to linking climate and tropical forest carbon cycling.

TI  - Effects of Different Types of Human Disturbance on Total and Nitrogen-Transforming Bacteria in Haihe River
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Haihe River is the largest water system in North China and is injected into the Bohai Sea in Tianjin City. In this study, different types of human disturbance (urban sewage, industrial pollution, ship disturbance) were selected from the upper reaches of Haihe river Tianjin section down to the estuary that connected with Bohai Sea for evaluation. By metagenomic sequencing, the effects of different types of disturbances on bacteria communities in Haihe sediments were studied, with a special focus on the function of nitrogen-cycling bacteria that were further analyzed through KEGG comparison. By analyzing the physical and chemical characteristics of sediments, results showed that human disturbance caused a large amount of nitrogen input into Haihe River, and different types of human disturbance led to distinct spatial heterogeneity in different sections of Haihe River. The bacteria community was dominated by Proteobacteria, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria. The relative abundance of each phylum varied at different sites as a response to different types of human disturbances. In nitrogen cycling, microorganisms including nitrogen fixation and removal were detected at each site, which indicated the active potential for nitrogen transformation in Haihe River. In addition, a large number of metabolic pathways relating to human diseases were also revealed in urban and pollution sites by function potential, which provided an important basis for the indicative role of urban river ecosystem for public health security. In summary, by evaluating both the ecological role and function potential of bacteria in Haihe River under different types of human disturbance, the knowledge of microorganisms for healthy and disturbed river ecosystems has been broadened, which is also informative for further river management and bioremediation.

TI  - Grazing exclusion alters denitrification N2O/(N2O + N2) ratio in alpine meadow of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Grazing exclusion has been implemented worldwide as a nature-based solution for restoring degraded grassland ecosystems that arise from overgrazing. However, the effect of grazing exclusion on soil nitrogen cycle processes, subsequent greenhouse gas emissions and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effect of four-year grazing exclusion on plant communities, soil properties, and soil nitrogen cycle-related functional gene abundance in an alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Using an automated continuous-flow incubation system, we performed an incubation experiment and measured soil-borne N2O, N-2, and CO2 fluxes to three successive "hot moment" events (precipitation, N deposition, and oxic-to-anoxic transition) between grazing-excluded and grazing soil. Higher soil N contents (total nitrogen, NH4+, NO3-) and extracellular enzyme activities (beta-1,4-glucosidase, beta-1,4-N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, cellobiohydrolase) are observed under grazing exclusion. The aboveground and litter biomass of plant community was significantly increased by grazing exclusion, but grazing exclusion decreased the average number of plant species and microbial diversity. The N2O + N-2 fluxes observed under grazing exclusion were higher than those observed under free grazing. The N-2 emissions and N2O/(N2O + N-2) ratios observed under grazing exclusion were higher than those observed under free grazing in oxic conditions. Instead, higher N2O fluxes and lower denitrification functional gene abundances (nirS, nirK, nosZ, and nirK + nirS) under anoxia were found under grazing exclusion than under free grazing. The N2O site-preference value indicates that under grazing exclusion, bacterial denitrification contributes more to higher N2O production compared with under free grazing (81.6 % vs. 59.9 %). We conclude that grazing exclusion could improve soil fertility and plant biomass, nevertheless it may lower plant and microbial diversity and increase potential N2O emission risk via the alteration of the denitrification end-product ratio. This indicates that not all grassland management options result in a mutually beneficial situation among wider environmental goals such as greenhouse gas mitigation, biodiversity, and social welfare.

TI  - Negative responses of ecosystem autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration to experimental warming in a Tibetan semi-arid alpine steppe
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Evaluating the responses of ecosystem respiration (Re) and its components to climate change is crucial for predicting terrestrial carbon cycling, particularly for the alpine grassland ecosystems. However, effects of climatic warming on ecosystem heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and autotrophic respiration (Ra) remain poorly understood in semi-arid alpine grasslands. A field manipulative experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of experimental warming on total Re, Rh and Ra in a Tibetan semi-arid alpine steppe during growing seasons of 2013 and 2014. Our results showed that warming decreased seasonal Re, Rh and Ra by 29%, 37% and 13%, respectively. However, warming tended to increase the contribution of Ra to Re (Ra/Re) but decrease that of Rh to Re (Rh/Re). Negative responses of Re was closely related to the changes in plant biomass and soil microbial biomass carbon. The apparent Q(10) values of Ra were higher than those of Re and Rh, with the Q(10) values ranked as Ra > Re > Rh. Warming decreased the apparent Q(10) values of Re and the two components. Our results emphasize that Re and its components respond negatively to experimental warming, and soil carbon loss has the potential to be less under future climatic warming in the Tibetan semi-arid alpine steppe.

TI  - Change from paddy rice to vegetable growing changes nitrogen-cycling microbial communities and their variation with depth in the soil
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Changes in land use are likely to affect the abundance and functioning of microorganisms in the soil. In China many paddy fields are being converted for vegetable growing. We wished to determine how these changes affected the microbial populations in one particular region in Hunan province, where the climate is subtropical monsoon, as an example. We sampled the soil down to 1m in several fields: three that were still growing paddy rice, three that had been converted for vegetable growing 2 years earlier and three that had been growing vegetables for 25 years. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) were used to determine the abundance and community composition of nxrA-containing nitrifiers and narG-containing denitrifiers in the soil. The abundances of these organisms depended largely on the amount of organic matter in the soil and decreased with increasing depth, as did the potential nitrification rate (PNR) and nitrate reductase activity (NRA). Enzyme activity was significantly correlated with the abundance of nitrogen-cycling bacteria. The change from rice to vegetable growing resulted in more residual nitrate-N in the soil, which correlated more strongly with the abundance of nxrA-containing nitrifiers in the topsoil (0-20 cm) and narG-containing denitrifiers in the deeper soil (80-100 cm). In general, the numbers of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms decreased markedly with increasing depth, but were less affected by the change from rice to vegetable cultivation in the fields investigated. Our results suggest that the abundances of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities are affected more by depth in the soil than by change of land use in these circumstances.

TI  - Implication of Viral Infections for Greenhouse Gas Dynamics in Freshwater Wetlands: Challenges and Perspectives
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Viruses are non-living, acellular entities, and the most abundant biological agents on earth. They are widely acknowledged as having the capacity to influence global biogeochemical cycles by infecting the bacterial and archaeal populations that regulate carbon and nutrient turnover. Evidence suggests that the majority of viruses in wetlands are bacteriophages, but despite their importance, studies on how viruses control the prokaryotic community and the concomitant impacts on ecosystem function (such as carbon cycling and greenhouse gas flux) in wetlands are rare. Here we investigate virus-prokaryote interactions in freshwater wetland ecosystems in the context of their potential influence on biogeochemical cycling. Specifically, we (1) synthesize existing literature to establish current understanding of virus-prokaryote interactions, focusing on the implications for wetland greenhouse gas dynamics and (2) identify future research priorities. Viral dynamics in freshwater wetlands have received much less attention compared to those in marine ecosystems. However; based on our literature review, within the last 10 years, viral ecology studies on freshwater wetlands have increased twofold. Despite this increase in literature, the potential implication of viral infections on greenhouse gas emission dynamics is still a knowledge gap. We hypothesize that the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and the pool of sequestered carbon could be strongly linked to the type and rate of viral infection. Viral replication mechanism choice will consequently influence the microbial efficiency of organic matter assimilation and thus the ultimate fate of carbon as a greenhouse gas or stored in soils.

TI  - Carbon cycling in rice field ecosystems in the context of input, decomposition and translocation of organic materials and the fates of their end products (CO2 and CH4)
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Rice fields are intensively managed, unique agroecosystems, where soil flooding is general performance for rice cultivation. Flooding the field results in reductive soil conditions, under which decomposition of organic materials proceeds during the period of rice cultivation. A large variety of organic materials are incorporated into rice soils according to field management. In this review, the kind and abundance of organic materials entering carbon cycling in the rice field ecosystem are evaluated first. Then, decomposition of plant residues and soil organic matter in rice fields is reviewed quantitatively. Decomposition of plant residues is shown to be the active process in carbon cycling in rice fields. Rice releases photosynthates into the rhizosphere (rhizodeposition), and they follow a different avenue of decomposition in soil from that of plant residues. Incorporation of rhizodeposition into microbial biomass and soil organic matter during the period of rice cultivation, and their fates after harvesting are evaluated quantitatively from C-13 pulse labeled experiments. Percolating water transports inorganic and organic carbon from the plow layer to the subsoil layer. The amounts of their transport and accumulation in the subsoil layer are evaluated in relation to the amounts of soil organic C in the plow layer. Not only CO2 but also CH4 are produced in the decomposition process of organic materials in flooded rice fields. CH4 evolution from rice fields is of global concern from the viewpoint of global warming. Origins of CH4 evolved from rice fields are estimated first, followed by the fates of CH4 in rice field ecosystems. Rhizodeposition is shown to be the main origin of CH4 evolved from rice fields. Evolution to the atmosphere is not the sole pathway of CH4 produced in rice fields. The amounts of CH4 retained in soil, percolated to the subsoil layer and decomposed in soil are evaluated in the context of the amounts of CH4 efflux. Thus, this review focuses on carbon cycling in the rice field ecosystem from the viewpoints of input, decomposition, and translocation of organic materials and the fates of their end products (CO2 and CH4).

TI  - Plant trait-based approaches to improve nitrogen cycling in agroecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - Intensive agriculture is dominated by monocultures of high-yielding plants that receive large applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizers to boost plant productivity. However, these systems have low N use efficiency (NUE) as fertilized plants generally take up less than half of the N applied. A large fraction of the remainder N is susceptible to be lost from the agroecosystem generating a cascade of environmental and socio-economic problems. Climate change and projected global increases in fertilizer use pose further risks to N losses and yield stability. We review and translate concepts from ecology in natural systems to demonstrate that NUE in intensive agroecosystems can be strongly increased by fine-tuning the traits of the plant communities to the levels of N fertilization intensity. We present key plant traits of importance for N-cycling (architectural, morphological and physiological traits, as well as symbiotic associations and exudation patterns); discuss ecological (with soil fauna and N-cycling microbial communities) and agronomic interactions of this approach; propose interdisciplinary methodologies for future research ranging from pot to global scales; and highlight possible solutions leading to an optimal balance between N fertilizer use and productivity. Synthesis and applications. By showing the strong links between plant traits and nitrogen (N) cycling, our work opens possibilities to test ecologically informed hypotheses across gradients of soil fertility and N fertilizer management intensity, setting a research agenda for the coming years. Accordingly, the choice of plant species based on their functional traits will play a central role for the development of modern and productive agroecosystems that retain and use N more efficiently.

TI  - Nanoplastic aggravates CH4 and N2O emission in plant-soil system
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING
AB  - As nanoplastics continue to accumulate in natural wetland ecosystems, it remains unclear whether and how the effects of nanoplastics on the emission of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Here we constructed a simulated natural wetland and introduced polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) to investigate the effects and potential mechanisms on CH4 and N2O emissions. The results indicated that PS-NPs can increase CH4 emissions by 20% to 100% and N2O emissions by approximately 100%. Analysis of the microbial community and plant functional characteristics in soils showed that PS-NPs inhibited plant growth and photosynthesis, and weakened plant stress resistance. Changes in plant functional characteristics affect the oxygen production capacity and secretion content of plant roots, which further affect the microbial community structure and metabolic activity of rhizosphere soil, enhancing methanogenesis and denitrification processes during the carbon and nitrogen cycles, resulting in increased CH4 and N2O emissions. Therefore, the continuous accumulation of PS-NPs is an important factor in changing the carbon sink function of wetlands. This study underscores the importance of controlling plastics pollution for the emission of greenhouse gases.

TI  - Global climate change and the evolutionary ecology of ecosystem functioning
T2  - CLIMATE CHANGE AND SPECIES INTERACTIONS: WAYS FORWARD
AB  - Environmental warming due to global climate change is an important stressor that stands to alter organismal physiology and, ultimately, carbon cycling in ecosystems. Yet the theoretical framework for predicting warming effects on whole-ecosystem carbon balance by way of changes in organismal physiology remains rudimentary. This is because ecosystem science has yet to embrace principles of evolutionary ecology that offer the means to explain how environmental stress on organisms mediates ecosystem carbon dynamics. Here, using selected case studies and a theoretical model, I sketch out one framework that shows how increases in animal metabolic rates in response to thermal stress lead to phenotypically plastic shifts in animal elemental demand, from nitrogen-rich proteins that support production to carbon-rich soluble carbohydrates that support elevated energy demands. I further show how such a switch in resource selection alters the fate of carbon between atmospheric versus animal, plant, and soil pools. The framework shows that animals, despite having relatively low biomass representation in ecosystems, can nonetheless have disproportionately larger effects on carbon cycling in ecosystems whose effects are exacerbated by environmental stressors like climate warming.

TI  - Modeling boreal forest soil dynamics with the microbially explicit soil model MIMICS+ (v1.0)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Understanding carbon exchange processes between land reservoirs and the atmosphere is essential for predicting carbon-climate feedbacks. Still, considerable uncertainty remains in the representation of the terrestrial carbon cycle in Earth system models. An emerging strategy to constrain these uncertainties is to include the role of different microbial groups explicitly. Following this approach, we extend the framework of the MIcrobial-MIneral Carbon Stabilization (MIMICS) model with additional mycorrhizal groups and a nitrogen cycle that includes a novel representation of inorganic nitrogen sorption to particles via a Langmuir isotherm. MIMICS+ v1.0 is designed to capture and quantify relationships between soil microorganisms and their environment, with a particular emphasis on boreal ecosystems. We evaluated MIMICS+ against podzolic soil profiles in Norwegian forests as well as the conventional Community Land Model (CLM). MIMICS+ matched observed carbon stocks better than CLM and gave a broader range of C : N ratios, more in line with observations. This is mainly explained by a higher directly plant-derived fraction into the soil organic matter (SOM) pools. The model produces microbial biomass estimates in line with numbers reported in the literature. MIMICS+ also showed better representation of climate gradients than CLM, especially in terms of temperature. To investigate responses to changes in nutrient availability, we performed an N enrichment experiment and found that nitrogen sorbed to particles through the sorption algorithm served as a long-term storage of nutrients for the microbes. Furthermore, although the microbial groups responded considerably to the nitrogen enrichment, we only saw minor responses for carbon storage and respiration. Together, our results present MIMICS+ as an attractive tool for further investigations of interactions between microbial functioning and their (changing) environment.

TI  - Increased temperature enhances microbial-mediated lignin decomposition in river sediment
T2  - MICROBIOME
AB  - BackgroundLignin, as the most abundant recalcitrant organic carbon in terrestrial ecosystems, plays a crucial role in the Earth's carbon cycle. After lignin entering aquatic environments, portion of it tends to accumulate in sediments, forming a stable carbon relatively reservoir. However, the increasing temperature caused by human activities may impact microbial-mediated lignin decomposition, thereby affecting sedimentary carbon reservoirs. Therefore, revealing how temperature affects microbial-mediated lignin decomposition in river sediment, a topic that remains elusive, is essential for comprehending the feedbacks between river carbon reservoirs and climate. To address this, we conducted stable isotope probing of river surface sediment using 13C-lignin and 13C-vanillin, and utilized a series of techniques, including CO2 production analysis, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics, to identify the lignin-decomposing microbes and the effects of temperature on microbial-mediated lignin decomposition.ResultsWe found that elevated temperatures not only increased the total sediment respiration (total CO2) and the CO2 emissions from lignin/vanillin decomposition, but also enhanced priming effects. The 13C-labled taxa, including Burkholderiales, Sphingomonadales, and Pseudomonadales, were identified as the main potential lignin/vanillin decomposers, and their abundances and activity significantly increased as temperature increased. Furthermore, we observed that increasing temperature significantly increased the activity of lignin decomposing pathways, including beta-aryl ether fragments and 4,5-PDOG pathway. Additionally, as temperature increases, the transcriptional abundances of other carbon cycling related genes, such as pulA (starch decomposition) and xyla (hemicellulose decomposition), also exhibited increasing trends. Overall, our study elucidated the potential lignin-decomposing microbes and pathways in river sediment and their responses to temperature increasing.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that the temperature increasing can increase the rate of lignin/vanillin decomposition via affecting the activity of lignin-decomposing microbes. This finding indicates that the ongoing intensification of global warming may enhance the decomposition of recalcitrant organic carbon in river sediment, thereby impacting global carbon cycling.2anRetd-jJzJdxyPFmkMJsVideo AbstractConclusionsOur study demonstrated that the temperature increasing can increase the rate of lignin/vanillin decomposition via affecting the activity of lignin-decomposing microbes.

TI  - Ammonia-oxidizing archaea are integral to nitrogen cycling in a highly fertile agricultural soil
T2  - ISME COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Nitrification is a central process in the global nitrogen cycle, carried out by a complex network of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), complete ammonia-oxidizing (comammox) bacteria, and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). Nitrification is responsible for significant nitrogen leaching and N2O emissions and thought to impede plant nitrogen use efficiency in agricultural systems. However, the actual contribution of each nitrifier group to net rates and N2O emissions remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that highly fertile agricultural soils with high organic matter mineralization rates could allow a detailed characterization of N cycling in these soils. Using a combination of molecular and activity measurements, we show that in a mixed AOA, AOB, and comammox community, AOA outnumbered low diversity assemblages of AOB and comammox 50- to 430-fold, and strongly dominated net nitrification activities with low N2O yields between 0.18 and 0.41 ng N2O-N per & mu;g NOx-N in cropped, fallow, as well as native soil. Nitrification rates were not significantly different in plant-covered and fallow plots. Mass balance calculations indicated that plants relied heavily on nitrate, and not ammonium as primary nitrogen source in these soils. Together, these results imply AOA as integral part of the nitrogen cycle in a highly fertile agricultural soil.

AB  - Predators can disproportionately impact the structure and function of ecosystems relative to their biomass. These effects may be exacerbated under warming in ecosystems like the Arctic, where the number and diversity of predators are low and small shifts in community interactions can alter carbon cycle feedbacks. Here, we show that warming alters the effects of wolf spiders, a dominant tundra predator, on belowground litter decomposition. Specifically, while high densities of wolf spiders result in faster litter decomposition under ambient temperatures, they result, instead, in slower decomposition under warming. Higher spider densities are also associated with elevated levels of available soil nitrogen, potentially benefiting plant production. Changes in decomposition rates under increased wolf spider densities are accompanied by trends toward fewer fungivorous Collembola under ambient temperatures and more Collembola under warming, suggesting that Collembola mediate the indirect effects of wolf spiders on decomposition. The unexpected reversal of wolf spider effects on Collembola and decomposition suggest that in some cases, warming does not simply alter the strength of top-down effects but, instead, induces a different trophic cascade altogether. Our results indicate that climate change-induced effects on predators can cascade through other trophic levels, alter critical ecosystem functions, and potentially lead to climate feedbacks with important global implications. Moreover, given the expected increase in wolf spider densities with climate change, our findings suggest that the observed cascading effects of this common predator on detrital processes could potentially buffer concurrent changes in decomposition rates.

TI  - The Stochastic Assembly of Nitrobacter winogradskyi-Selected Microbiomes with Heterotrophs from Sewage Sludge or Grassland Soil
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Chemolitho-autotrophic microorganisms like the nitrite-oxidizing Nitrobacter winogradskyi create an environment for heterotrophic microorganisms that profit from the production of organic compounds. It was hypothesized that the assembly of a community of heterotrophic microorganisms around N. winogradskyi depends on the ecosystem from which the heterotrophs are picked. To test this hypothesis, pure cultures of N. winogradskyi were grown in continuously nitrite-fed bioreactors in a mineral medium free of added organic carbon that had been inoculated with diluted sewage sludge or with a suspension from a grassland soil. Samples for chemical and 16S rRNA gene amplicon analyses were taken after each volume change in the bioreactor. At the end of the enrichment runs, samples for shotgun metagenomics were also collected. Already after two volume changes, the transformations in community structure became less dynamic. The enrichment of heterotrophs from both sewage and soil was highly stochastic and yielded different dominant genera in most of the enrichment runs that were independent of the origin of the inoculum. Hence, the hypothesis had to be refuted. Notwithstanding the large variation in taxonomic community structure among the enrichments, the functional compositions of the communities were statistically not different between soil- and sludge-based enrichments. IMPORTANCE In the process of aerobic nitrification, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria together with ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms convert mineral nitrogen from its most reduced appearance, i.e., ammonium, into its most oxidized form, i.e., nitrate. Because the form of mineral nitrogen has large environmental implications, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria such as Nitrobacter winogradskyi play a central role in the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. In addition to this central role, the autotrophic nitrite-oxidizing bacteria also play a fundamental role in the global carbon cycle. They form the basis of heterotrophic food webs, in which the assimilated carbon is recycled. Little is known about the heterotrophic microorganisms that participate in these food webs, let alone their assembly in different ecosystems. This study showed that the assembly of microbial food webs by N. winogradskyi was a highly stochastic process and independent of the origin of the heterotrophic microorganisms, but the functional characteristics of the different food webs were similar.

TI  - Metagenomic insights into carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling in a no-till intercropping system
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and AimsIntercropping implemented with no-tillage has been recommended as an agricultural strategy to improve crop productivity and soil health. However, limited research has explored the changes in the diversity and abundance of genes related to soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling in a no-till maize/pea intercropping system.MethodsAn 8-year field experiment was conducted to investigate microbial functional profiles in 0-30 cm soils of maize and pea strips in mono-/intercropping systems under the no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) conditions in an arid and semiarid area of China.ResultsThe tillage practices and cropping patterns significantly affected the diversity and abundance of functional genes directly driven by soil properties. Intercropped maize exhibited a significant increase in the abundance of genes (tktA/tktB and rbcL) associated with carbon fixation compared to monocropped maize under the CT or NT condition. Intercropped maize under no-tillage practice significantly reduced the abundance of the CH4 oxidation gene porB and nitrate reduction gene norB, which restricts greenhouse gas production. Intercropping strips with higher soil nutrient contents than monocropping strips resulted in a reduction in the abundance of genes (gcd, phoR, phnJ), which contributed to decreases in inorganic phosphorus solubilization and organic phosphorus mineralization. Consequently, this led to increased phosphorus storage, particularly under the NT condition.ConclusionsThis research highlights that maize/pea intercropping combined with no-tillage practice is a particularly effective strategy for enhancing nutrient sequestration and reducing emissions in environmentally sustainable agriculture.

TI  - Proteolytic Activity in Meadow Soil after the Application of Phytohormones
T2  - BIOMOLECULES
AB  - Phytohormones, similar to soil enzymes, are synthesized and secreted into the soil environment by fungi and microorganisms. Phytohormones are involved in regulating microbial community activity in the rhizosphere. This paper examines how auxins, cytokinins, ethephon and chlorocholine chloride affect the activity of native soil proteases in the organo-mineral horizon of an alpine meadow. In the meadow habitat, native soil proteases were inhibited by auxins whereas the effect of cytokinins on these enzymes was not statistically significant. A similar inhibitory effect on the activity of proteases was shown for ethephon and chlorocholine chloride, both of which also inhibited the activity of native soil proteases in the alpine meadow soil. Overall, the inhibitory effect of phytohormones on the activity of native protease activity may affect plant nutrition by retarding the nitrogen cycle in the soil. This work contributes to our understanding of the influence of substances produced by the rhizosphere that can actively participate in the activity of soil microorganisms and consequently influence the soil nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Atmospheric Trace Gas Oxidizers Contribute to Soil Carbon Fixation Driven by Key Soil Conditions in Terrestrial Ecosystems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Microbial oxidizers of trace gases such as hydrogen (H-2) and carbon monoxide (CO) are widely distributed in soil microbial communities and play a vital role in modulating biogeochemical cycles. However, the contribution of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation and the driving environmental factors remain unclear, especially on large scales. Here, we utilized biogeochemical and genome-resolved metagenomic profiling, assisted by machine learning analysis, to estimate the contributions of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation and to predict the key environmental factors driving this process in soils from five distinct ecosystems. The results showed that phylogenetically and physiologically diverse H-2 and CO oxidizers and chemosynthetic carbon-fixing microbes are present in the soil in different terrestrial ecosystems. The large-scale variations in soil carbon fixation were highly positively correlated with both the abundance and the activity of H-2 and CO oxidizers (p < 0.05-0.001). Furthermore, soil pH and moisture-induced shifts in the abundance of H-2 and CO oxidizers partially explained the variation in soil carbon fixation (55%). The contributions of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation in the different terrestrial ecosystems were estimated to range from 1.1% to 35.0%. The estimated rate of trace gas carbon fixation varied from 0.04 to 1.56 mg kg(-1) d(-1). These findings reveal that atmospheric trace gas oxidizers may contribute to soil carbon fixation driven by key soil environmental factors, highlighting the non-negligible contribution of these microbes to terrestrial carbon cycling.

TI  - A theory for context-dependent effects of mammalian trampling on ecosystem nitrogen cycling
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Large mammalian herbivores substantially impact ecosystem functioning. As their populations are dramatically altered globally, disentangling their consumptive and non-consumptive effects is critical to advance mechanistic understanding and improve prediction of effects over ecosystem and Earth-system spatial extents. Mathematical models have played an important role in clarifying potential mechanisms of herbivore zoogeochemistry, based mostly on their consumptive effects as primary consumers and recyclers of organic and inorganic matter via defecation and urination. Trampling is a ubiquitous effect among walking vertebrates, but the consequences and potential mechanisms of trampling in diverse environments remain poorly understood. We derive a novel mathematical model of large mammalian herbivore effects on ecosystem nitrogen cycling, focusing on how trampling and environmental context impact soil processes. We model herbivore trampling with a linear positive or negative additive effect on soil-mediated nitrogen cycling processes. Combining analytical and numerical analyses, we find trampling by large mammalian herbivores is likely to decrease nitrogen mineralisation rate across diverse environments, such as temperate grassland and boreal forest. These effects are mediated by multiple potential mechanisms, including trampling-induced changes to detritivore biomass and functioning (e.g. rate of organic matter consumption). We also uncover scenarios where trampling can increase nitrogen mineralisation rate, contingent on the environment-specific relative sensitivity of detritivore mineral-nitrogen release and detritivore mortality, to trampling. In contrast to some consumptive mechanisms, our results suggest the pace of soil nitrogen cycling prior to trampling has little influence over the direction of the trampling net effect on nitrogen mineralisation, but that net effects may be greater in slow-cycling systems (e.g. boreal forests) than in fast-cycling systems (e.g. grasslands). Our model clarifies the potential consequences of previously overlooked mechanisms of zoogeochemistry that are common to all terrestrial biomes. Our results provide empirically testable predictions to guide future progress in empirical and theoretical studies of herbivore effects in diverse environmental contexts. Resolving ecological contingencies around animal consumptive and non-consumptive effects will improve whole-ecosystem management efforts such as restoration and rewilding.
   Trampling of vegetation and soil is ubiquitous among walking vertebrates, yet most models and empirical studies do not explicitly consider trampling impacts on ecosystem elemental cycling. With a new mathematical model, the authors resolve context-dependent trampling effects on nitrogen cycling via multiple mechanisms related to detritivore functioning and mortality.image

TI  - Deciphering the Inhibition of Ethane on Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and nitrification, two common biological ammonium oxidation pathways, are critical for the microbial nitrogen cycle. Short chain alkanes (C-2-C-8) have been well-known as inhibitors for nitrification through interaction with the ammonia monooxygenase, while whether these alkanes affect anammox is an open question. Here, this work demonstrated significant inhibition of ethane on anammox and revealed the inhibitory mechanism. The acute inhibition of ethane on anammox was concentration-dependent and reversible; 0.86 mM dissolved ethane caused 50% inhibition (IC50), and 1.72 mM ethane almost completely inhibited anammox. After long-term exposure to 0.09 mM ethane for 30 days, the ammonium (nitrite) removal rate dropped from 202 (267) mg N L-1 d(-1) to 1 (1) mg N L-1 d(-1), and the abundance of anammox bacteria decreased from 61.9% to 9.5%. The intercellular ammonium concentration of anammox bacteria decreased after ethane exposure, while metatranscriptome analysis showed significant upregulation of genes for ammonium transport of anammox bacteria. Thus, ethane could suppress ammonium uptake resulting in the inhibition of anammox activities. As ethane is the second most prevalent alkane after methane in various anoxic environments, ethane may have an important effect on the nitrogen cycle driven by anammox that should be investigated in future research.

TI  - Impact of diversified cropping systems and fertilization strategies on soil microbial abundance and functional potentials for nitrogen cycling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Diversified cropping systems and fertilization strategies were proposed to enhance the abundance and diversity of the soil microbiome, thereby stabilizing their beneficial services for maintaining soil fertility and supporting plant growth. Here, we assessed across three different long-term field experiments in Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Northern Germany) whether diversified cropping systems and fertilization strategies also affect their functional gene abundance. Soil DNA was analyzed by quantitative PCR for quantifying bacteria, archaea and fungi as well as functional genes related to nitrogen (N) transformations; including bacterial and archaeal nitrification (amoA-bac,arch), three steps of the denitrification process (nirK, nirS and nosZ-cladeI,II) and N2 assimilation (nifH), respectively. Crop diversification and fertilization strategies generally enhanced soil total carbon (C), N and microbial abundance, but with variation between sites. Overall effects of diversified cropping systems and fertilization strategies on functional genes were much stronger than on the abundance of bacteria, archaea and fungi. The legume-based cropping systems showed great potential not only in stimulating the growth of Nfixing microorganisms but also in boosting downstream functional potentials for N cycling. The sorghum-based intercropping system suppressed soil ammonia oxidizing prokaryotes. N fertilization reduced the abundance of nitrifiers and denitrifiers except for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, while the application of the synthetic nitrification inhibitor DMPP combined with mineral N reduced growth of both ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a strong impact of diversified agricultural practices on the soil microbiome and their functional potentials mediating N transformations.

TI  - Thirty-year dryland crop rotation improves soil multifunctionality and shifts soil fungal community
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsCrop rotation plays an important role in changing soil microbial communities, which is critical to maintaining soil multifunctionality. However, limited data exist on the long term impact of crop rotations on soil multifunctionality and its link with soil fungal community in drylands.MethodsIn a dryland field experiment with 30-year legume- and non-legume-based winter wheat rotations and winter wheat-fallow system, we investigated the soil multifunctionality (via cycling and pools of soil carbon and nitrogen) and the overall community and functional groups of soil fungi. The links between soil multifunctionality and fungal communities were also explored.ResultsWe found that long-term crop rotation increased soil multifunctionality index and that of carbon cycle. Crop rotation shifted soil fungal community composition, and reduced the proportion of putative pathotrophs. The overall fungal community was almost equally explained by soil and plant variables, while fungal functional groups (i.e., saprotrophs and pathotrophs) were more affected by soil variables. The indicator taxa in the non-legume-winter wheat rotation were distinctly different from those in the legume-based winter wheat rotation soils, indicating that the non-legume-winter wheat rotation selects different fungal taxa from the legume-based winter wheat rotation. Moreover, the changes in community composition of soil fungi, putative saprotrophs and pathotrophs were related to soil multifunctionality and that of carbon and nitrogen cycles.ConclusionsOur results highlight that long-term crop rotations shape the soil fungal communities; the changes in soil fungi and fungal functional groups have potential to improve soil multifunctionality in the crop rotation systems in drylands.

TI  - Linking microbial community dynamics to rhizosphere carbon flow in a wetland rice soil
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Photosynthesis by terrestrial vegetation is the driving force of carbon cycling between soil and the atmosphere. The soil microbiota, the decomposers of organic matter, is the second player carrying out carbon cycling. Numerous efforts have been made to quantify rhizodeposition and soil respiration to understand and predict the carbon cycling between the soil and atmosphere. However, there have been few attempts to link directly the soil microbial community to plant photosynthesis. We carried out a pulse-chase labeling experiment in a wetland rice system in which rice plants of various ages were labeled with (CO2)-C-13 for 6 h and the distribution of the assimilated C-13 to soil microorganisms was estimated by analyzing the C-13 profile of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). The results showed that total PLFA increased with plant growth, indicating an increase of microbial biomass. But the mono-unsaturated PLFAs increased faster than the branched chain fatty acids. The C-13 was incorporated into PLFAs immediately after the plant (CO2)-C-13 assimilation, proving the tight coupling of microbial activity to plant photosynthesis. In line with the finding of seasonal change in total PLFAs, more of C-13 was distributed to the straight chain fatty acids (16:0, 16:1omega7, 18:1omega7 and 18:1omega9) than to the branched chain fatty acids. The total plant carbon incorporation estimated from C-13 labeling roughly corresponded to the increase in total PLFAs over the growing season of plants. Our study suggests that microbial populations in rice soil differ greatly in their responses to plant photosynthate input. (C) 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

TI  - Recycled by leaf inhabitants: Terrestrial bacteria drive the mineralization of organic matter in lake water
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Terrestrial organic matter subsidizes aquatic food webs and plays an important role in carbon cycling in lake ecosystems, where it is decomposed mainly by microbes. However, the contribution of terrestrial and aquatic microbiomes on terrestrial carbon cycling and their effects on the biochemical fate of carbon has remained understudied. Therefore, we explored the microbial carbon utilization of three chemically differing leaf species in lake water in microcosms and quantified the biochemical endpoints of leaf carbon in CO2, CH4, and microbial biomass. Additionally, we identified microbial taxa responsible for leaf carbon recycling and studied the role of epiphytic and endophytic leaf microbiomes in microbial community succession in lake water. Microbially utilized leaf carbon was mainly respired (82.7 +/- 1.4%), whereas a small proportion (17.1 +/- 1.4%) was assimilated into biomass. Carbon from nitrogen-rich alder leaves was taken up at the fastest rate, whereas birch leaf addition produced the highest concentrations of CH4, suggesting that leaf chemistry affects the decomposition rate and biochemical fate of carbon. In particular, terrestrial bacteria shaped the succession of aquatic bacterial communities. The addition of leaves resulted in the equal contribution of epiphytic and endophytic bacteria in the lake water, whereas epiphytic fungi dominated the fungal community structure. Our results suggest that terrestrial bacteria originating from terrestrial leaves influence the microbiome succession in lake ecosystems and play a key role in linking terrestrial carbon to an aquatic food web and determining the quality of carbon emissions that are released into the atmosphere.

TI  - Ammonia-oxidising Crenarchaeota: important players in the nitrogen cycle?
T2  - TRENDS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Cultivation-independent molecular surveys show that members of the kingdom Crenarchaeota within the domain Archaea represent a substantial component of microbial communities in aquatic and terrestrial environments. Recently, metagenomic studies have revealed that such Crenarchaeota contain and express genes related to those of bacterial ammonia monooxygenases. Furthermore, a marine chemolithoautotrophic strain was isolated that uses ammonia as a sole energy source. Considering the ubiquity and abundance of Crenarchaeota, these findings considerably challenge the accepted view of the microbial communities involved in global nitrogen cycling. However, the quantitative contribution of Archaea to nitrification in marine and terrestrial environments still remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Light inhibition of carbon mineralization associated with iron redox processes in calcareous paddy soil
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - Purpose The iron redox cycle is closely tied to the fate of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems, especially paddy soils. Varies diurnally and seasonally, light-the crucial environmental factor-may be a fundamental factor elucidating temporal and spatial variabilities of carbon-containing gases emission. The role of sunlight in the iron-mediated carbon cycle, however, has not been fully elucidated. We conduct this study to test the role of light in the iron-mediated carbon cycling. Materials and methods In this study, we conducted anaerobic incubation experiments of a calcareous paddy soil in serum vials under alternating dark and light conditions. The dynamic evolution of the carbon and iron contents was evaluated by measuring the CO2, CH4, and O-2 concentrations in the headspace of the vials, as well as the water-soluble inorganic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and HCl-extractable ferrous iron contents in soil slurries. We also analyzed the soil microbial community structure by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results and discussion The results highlighted the positive correlation between carbon mineralization and ferric iron reduction under dark conditions. Under light conditions, however, ferrous iron was oxidized by the O-2 generated via oxygenic photosynthesis of phototrophic bacteria such as Cyanobacteria, along with a decreased production of CO2, CH4, and water-soluble inorganic carbon. The abundance of Cyanobacteria positively correlated to O-2 levels and MBC content significantly. Light-induced periodic variations in the redox conditions facilitated carbon fixation in microbial biomass and up to 31.79 mu mol g(-1) carbon was sequestrated during 30 days light incubation. Conclusions These results indicate that light inhibits the emission of carbon-containing greenhouse gases associated with the iron redox cycle in calcareous paddy soil. Assimilation of inorganic carbon by phototrophs may responsible for the inhibition of carbon mineralization. Our study suggests that procedures allowing more light to reach the soil surface, for instance, reducing the planting density, may mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and promote carbon sequestration in paddy soils.

TI  - NLOSS:: A mechanistic model of denitrified N2O and N2 evolution from soil
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Soil microbial denitrification is a significant source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), a trace gas important in global climate change and stratospheric ozone depletion. In this paper we describe a mechanistic submodel, which is incorporated in the model NLOSS, designed to predict the soil biogenic source and efflux of N2O and N-2 during denitrification, NLOSS simulates transient soil moisture and temperature, decomposition, soil anaerobicity, denitrifying bacterial biomass, rates of soil nitrogen transformations, soil trace-gas transport, and gas efflux to the atmosphere. Uncertainty in predicted N gas effluxes is commuted using a Monte Carlo approach. We test NLOSS's denitrification estimates by comparing predictions with results from a N-15 tracer experiment in a Mexican agricultural system. The model accurately predicted the measured soil moisture and denitrified N2O and N-2 fluxes during the experiment. We also apply NLOSS to compute denitrified N trace-gas speciation curves as a function of soil hydrologic properties and moisture content. These speciation curves will be used in future work to extrapolate the plot-scale modeling results presented here to field and regional estimates of N trace-gas emissions. The results presented here suggest that NLOSS can be used to identify the processes most important for trace-gas losses and to facilitate efforts to scale plot-level modeling results to regional estimates of N trace-gas emissions.

AB  - The activities of CO2 emission, N-2 fixation, and denitrification, as well as the physiological state of the community of microbial decomposers are assessed at different stages of decay of coarse woody debris (CWD) in the incubation experiments with the Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) and the humus horizon of podzolic soil (Retisol). The CWD of five decomposition stages and soil are sampled at the experimental plots of the Central Forest State Reserve (Tver oblast, Russia). The maximum CO2 emissions are associated with CWD decay stages III and IV. In addition, characteristic of these stages are the maximum values of the important indices of CWD and soil microbial activity, such as the substrate-induced respiration (SIR, 50 mu g C-CO2/(g h), share of easily decomposable C in organic matter (A(1), 66%), and metabolic quotient qCO(2) (0.78). Unlike the CO2 emission, the maximum activity of N-2 fixation is recorded earlier, during decay stage II. The N-2 fixation and denitrification activities indicate a gradual and intricately regulated transition process from the properties of CWD bacterial and fungal communities to those in soil during stages II, III, and IV. A dramatic decrease (more than threefold) is observed only for the C : N ratio in CWD at decay stage IV as compared with stage III. Although the CO2 emission at stage V sharply decreases, the CWD organic matter is less stable as compared with that of the Retisol.

TI  - Forest type and stand structure influence soil microbial network composition and stability in urban forests: Insights from Beijing, China
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
AB  - Urban forests are essential for enhancing urban livability, with their soil microbial communities playing a key role in ecosystem stability and function. However, how different urban forest types influence these microbial communities is not well understood. We investigated soil microbial communities in five distinct forests (dominated by Populus tomentosa, Robinia pseudoacacia, Salix matsudana, Eucommia ulmoides, and Ailanthus altissima) in Beijing's plain ecological forests. Using metagenomic sequencing, microbial co-occurrence network analysis, and structural equation modeling, we found that forest type significantly affected microbial diversity, functional gene abundance, and the structure of microbial networks. Salix matsudana soils exhibited the highest microbial diversity, and community structure differed significantly among forest types. Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla, indicative of their oligotrophic adaptation to carbon-rich forest soils and their specialized roles in nitrogen cycling, respectively. Populus tomentosa showed highest interconnectivity, while Robinia pseudoacacia had maximal topological integration. Network robustness was strongest in Salix matsudana, whereas Populus tomentosa and Ailanthus altissima were most vulnerable. A total of 430 key microbial functional genes (level 3 KEGG orthologues) were identified, primarily involved in carbon cycling and microbial metabolism. Structural equation modeling accounted for 76.4 % of the variance in network robustness (R2 = 0.764) and 35.7 % of the variance in vulnerability (R2 = 0.357). The analysis identified tree density and height as critical determinants of network stability, while bacterial diversity and ammonium nitrogen emerged as the primary factors influencing network vulnerability. These findings provide important insights into the complex interactions between forest type, environmental factors, and soil microbial communities, highlighting the critical role of microbial network stability in informing urban forest management strategies.

TI  - Carbon-cycling microorganisms in permafrost and their responses to a warming climate: A review
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
AB  - Global climate warming is accelerating permafrost degradation. The large amounts of soil organic matter in permafrost-affected soils are prone to increased microbial decomposition in a warming climate. Along with permafrost degradation, changes to the soil microbiome play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding and in predicting the feedback of permafrost carbon. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge of carbon-cycling microbial ecology in permafrost regions. Microbiomes in degrading permafrost exhibit variations across spatial and temporal scales. Among the short-term, rapid degradation scenarios, thermokarst lakes have distinct biogeochemical conditions promoting emission of greenhouse gases. Additionally, extreme climatic events can trigger drastic changes in microbial consortia and activity. Notably, environmental conditions appear to exert a dominant influence on microbial assembly in permafrost ecosystems. Furthermore, as the global climate is closely connected to various permafrost regions, it will be crucial to extend our understanding beyond local scales, for example by conducting comparative and integrative studies between Arctic permafrost and alpine permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at global and continental scales. These comparative studies will enhance our understanding of microbial functioning in degrading permafrost ecosystems and help inform effective strategies for managing and mitigating the impacts of climate change on permafrost regions.

TI  - Different microbial distributions in the Yellow River delta
T2  - DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT
AB  - The microbial rules of nitrogen removal in wetlands with high salinity were unclear, which was important in the study of saline wastewater purification. In this study microbial quantity, diversity and physicochemical factors related to nitrogen cycling processes in a saline natural wetland were conducted. Results of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) revealed that relative abundance of anammox 168 rRNA gene (anammox for short) took the majority of the four tested nitrogen cycle genes (awn, Nitrospira 16S rRNA gene or nobL, for short, airs). The abundances of anammox were coupled well with salinity while the aerobic bacteria were inhibited. Deep 16S rRNA gene analysis of bacterial and archaea communities from soils showed that there were no significant differences in bacteria community structure between inland and inshore soils. However, the archaea community analysis indicated interesting results that Euryarchaeota was dominant in inshore soils, while Woesearchaeota took up over half of the inland soils. Furthermore, the.subdivision halobacteria of Euryarchaeota inshore and Woesearchaeota tycertae Sedis AR15-18 inland were the most potential candidates to remove the nitrogen in high-salt areas. These findings provided a preliminary conception for the design of constructed wetlands in treating high saline wastewater.

TI  - Contrasting effects of warming and N deposition on soil microbial functional genes in a subtropical forest
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Climate warming and nitrogen (N) deposition are expected to increase in the coming decades. The consequences of the interaction between warming and N deposition on forest ecosystems and their functions (i.e., carbon sequestration) remain uncertain. In this study, we examined the composition, diversities, and abundances of soil microbial functional genes in a subtropical forest after four years of exposure to warming and N addition. We found that warming alone did not have a significant effect on the composition, diversities, and abundances of functional genes, suggesting that four years were not long enough to reach the critical threshold that would activate a response to warming from soil functional genes in the subtropical forest. Conversely, warming significantly decreased soil labile carbon (C) content. The application of N in combination with warming significantly enhanced the diversities and abundances of functional genes associated with C and N cycling, leading to an accelerated loss of soil N. Interestingly, the interaction between warming and N addition did not have a significant effect on the diversities and abundances of functional genes associated with C and N cycling. Redundancy analysis indicated that a decrease in pH caused by N addition significantly affected the abundances of those functional genes. Overall, our study fills a research gap by examining the effect of simultaneous warming and N deposition on soil microbial functional genes in subtropical forests. Additionally, the study indicates that microbial functional genes are more sensitive to a combination of warming and N addition than to warming alone. Therefore, the effects of multi-factor global change on soil microbial functional genes cannot be underestimated.

TI  - TROPHIC INTERACTIONS AND NITROGEN CYCLING IN A SEMIARID GRASSLAND SOIL .1. SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF THE NATURAL-POPULATIONS, THEIR INTERACTIONS AND EFFECTS ON NITROGEN CYCLING
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - (1) Organism trophic structure and interactions and soil nutrient levels were assessed for a semi-arid grassland steppe monthly between April and October 1982. The observed trophic interactions with resultant changes in soil nitrogen were interpreted on the basis of simple predator-prey microcosm studies and models. (2) Seasonal responses in trophic interactions and N mineralization-immobilization processes were: (i) in the spring, predator groups (protozoa and nematodes) increased as their  food sources (bacteria and fungi, mainly) increased, subsequently reducing microbial biomass; (ii) reduced decomposer and increased grazer numbers occurred concomitant with increases in soil inorganic N; (iii) increased decomposer numbers (fourfold increase in bacterial numbers in September, for example) corresponded to decreased levels of soil inorganic N. (3) The complex, highly interconnected, and multi-linked food web that exists in the shortgrass prairie appeared to be stable in spite of considerable abiotic fluctuations (temperature extremes, water stress, and short period of active plant growth). The ability of predators to use more than one prey group provided a stabilizing influence.

TI  - Plant carbon allocation drives turnover of old soil organic matter in permafrost tundra soils
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Carbon cycle feedbacks from permafrost ecosystems are expected to accelerate global climate change. Shifts in vegetation productivity and composition in permafrost regions could influence soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover rates via rhizosphere (root zone) priming effects (RPEs), but these processes are not currently accounted for in model predictions. We use a radiocarbon (bomb-C-14) approach to test for RPEs in two Arctic tall shrubs, alder (Alnus viridis(Chaix) DC.) and birch (Betula glandulosaMichx.), and in ericaceous heath tundra vegetation. We compare surface CO(2)efflux rates and(14)C content between intact vegetation and plots in which below-ground allocation of recent photosynthate was prevented by trenching and removal of above-ground biomass. We show, for the first time, that recent photosynthate drives mineralization of older (>50 years old) SOC under birch shrubs and ericaceous heath tundra. By contrast, we find no evidence of RPEs in soils under alder. This is the first direct evidence from permafrost systems that vegetation influences SOC turnover through below-ground C allocation. The vulnerability of SOC to decomposition in permafrost systems may therefore be directly linked to vegetation change, such that expansion of birch shrubs across the Arctic could increase decomposition of older SOC. Our results suggest that carbon cycle models that do not include RPEs risk underestimating the carbon cycle feedbacks associated with changing conditions in tundra regions.

TI  - Assessing the Microbial Community and Functional Genes in a Vertical Soil Profile with Long-Term Arsenic Contamination
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Arsenic (As) contamination in soil and groundwater has become a serious problem to public health. To examine how microbial communities and functional genes respond to long-term arsenic contamination in vertical soil profile, soil samples were collected from the surface to the depth of 4 m (with an interval of 1 m) after 16-year arsenic downward infiltration. Integrating BioLog and functional gene microarray (GeoChip 3.0) technologies, we showed that microbial metabolic potential and diversity substantially decreased, and community structure was markedly distinct along the depth. Variations in microbial community functional genes, including genes responsible for As resistance, carbon and nitrogen cycling, phosphorus utilization and cytochrome c oxidases were detected. In particular, changes in community structures and activities were correlated with the biogeochemical features along the vertical soil profile when using the rbcL and nifH genes as biomarkers, evident for a gradual transition from aerobic to anaerobic lifestyles. The C/N showed marginally significant correlations with arsenic resistance (p = 0.069) and carbon cycling genes (p = 0.073), and significant correlation with nitrogen fixation genes (p = 0.024). The combination of C/N, NO3- and P showed the highest correlation (r = 0.779, p = 0.062) with the microbial community structure. Contradict to our hypotheses, a long-term arsenic downward infiltration was not the primary factor, while the spatial isolation and nutrient availability were the key forces in shaping the community structure. This study provides new insights about the heterogeneity of microbial community metabolic potential and future biodiversity preservation for arsenic bioremediation management.

TI  - Earth System Model Needs for Including the Interactive Representation of Nitrogen Deposition and Drought Effects on Forested Ecosystems
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - One of the biggest uncertainties of climate change is determining the response of vegetation to many co-occurring stressors. In particular, many forests are experiencing increased nitrogen deposition and are expected to suffer in the future from increased drought frequency and intensity. Interactions between drought and nitrogen deposition are antagonistic and non-additive, which makes predictions of vegetation response dependent on multiple factors. The tools we use (Earth system models) to evaluate the impact of climate change on the carbon cycle are ill equipped to capture the physiological feedbacks and dynamic responses of ecosystems to these types of stressors. In this manuscript, we review the observed effects of nitrogen deposition and drought on vegetation as they relate to productivity, particularly focusing on carbon uptake and partitioning. We conclude there are several areas of model development that can improve the predicted carbon uptake under increasing nitrogen deposition and drought. This includes a more flexible framework for carbon and nitrogen partitioning, dynamic carbon allocation, better representation of root form and function, age and succession dynamics, competition, and plant modeling using trait-based approaches. These areas of model development have the potential to improve the forecasting ability and reduce the uncertainty of climate models.

TI  - Species loss and nitrogen pollution alter litter decomposition dynamics in coastal salt marshes
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Litter decomposition is a central ecosystem function because dead plant biomass plays a critical role in carbon storage, the nitrogen (N) cycle, and as food/habitat for animals and microorganisms. In the face of global change, interactions between organisms that participate in litter decomposition are likely to change due to species loss and N pollution. To understand how these global change factors may interact to alter litter decomposition, we manipulated the detritivore community and N concentrations in a coastal salt marsh for 2 years. We chose to manipulate densities of a dominant, detritivorous snail (Melampus bidentatus) because its population size is expected to decline due to climate change, yet its impact on litter decomposition has not been tested in the field. We measured litter decomposition rates, detritivore densities, and the N concentrations of sediment and litter. We found that endogenous N enrichment (N added live plants before decomposition), exogenous N enrichment (N added to decomposing plants) and higher densities of Melampus increased litter decomposition rates. Linear mixed models further revealed that snails, other detritivores, and soil NH4+ were the best predictors of litter mass loss in the middle stages of decomposition. Notably, exogenous N added to litter already enriched with N further increased mass loss but did not increase litter %N. Our study reveals how global change in the form species loss and N pollution can have palpable impacts on carbon cycling and ecosystem function.

TI  - Bacterial community dynamics explain carbon mineralization and assimilation in soils of different land-use history
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil dwelling microorganisms are key players in the terrestrial carbon cycle, driving both the degradation and stabilization of soil organic matter. Bacterial community structure and function vary with respect to land use; yet the ecological drivers of this variation remain poorly described and difficult to predict. We conducted a multi-substrate DNA-stable isotope probing experiment across cropland, old-field, and forest habitats to link carbon mineralization dynamics with the dynamics of bacterial growth and carbon assimilation. We tracked the movement of C-13 derived from five distinct carbon sources as it was assimilated into bacterial DNA over time. We show that carbon mineralization, community composition, and carbon assimilation dynamics all differed with respect to land use. We also show that microbial community dynamics affect carbon assimilation dynamics and are associated with soil DNA content. Soil DNA yield is easy to measure and may be useful in predicting microbial community dynamics linked to soil carbon cycling. Soil dwelling microorganisms are key players in the terrestrial carbon cycle, driving both the degradation and stabilization of soil organic matter. Microbial communities vary with respect to land use, but we still have an incomplete understanding of how variation in community structure links to variation in community function. DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) is a high-resolution method that can identify specific microbial taxa that assimilate carbon in situ. We conducted a large-scale multi-substrate DNA-SIP experiment to explore differences in bacterial activity across land-use regimes. We show that microbial community dynamics vary with land use, that these dynamics are linked to soil carbon cycling, and that they are associated with easily measured soil properties.

TI  - The effect of biochar types on carbon cycles in farmland soils: A meta analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Application of biochar has been demonstrated to be a successful strategy for boosting soil carbon sequestration and altering the agricultural soil carbon cycle. However, in the studies involving biochar worldwide, the effects of different types of biochar on the soil carbon component response direction and increase are not consistent. Therefore, to assess the effects of applying four types of biochar during the soil carbon cycle on carbon components on a farmland, we performed a meta-analysis of 1150 comparisons from 86 peer-reviewed publications. Generally speaking, the types of biochar raw materials have a significant impact on soil carbon cycle. The application of chaff biochar significantly inhibited (10.0 %) soil respiration, while the application of manure biochar (47.0 %), straw biochar (11.2 %) and wood biochar (8.7 %) showed a strong promotion effect on CO2 emission. In addition, although the soil organic C, microbial biomass C and dissolved organic C all had positive responses to the application of the four biochar types, the degree and increase in their response varied greatly due to the differences in biomass raw materials. Moreover, by increasing the biochar rates applied to coarsetextured soils with low average annual rainfall and an average temperature under controlled circumstances, the relative increase in SOC was encouraged. Meanwhile, applying low temperature pyrolytic biochar (<= 400 C-degrees) at a lower rate (<25 t/ha) in the long-term experiment (>3 years) is more beneficial to soil C sequestration and emission reduction. Hence, climatic conditions, agricultural management practices, and initial soil properties jointly constrained and influenced the ability of biochar to alter the soil C cycle. Based on this, our research offers a fresh viewpoint for making a profound study biochar-enhanced soil C cycle.

TI  - Intensified river salinization alters nitrogen-cycling microbial communities in arid and semi-arid regions of China
T2  - ECO-ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH
AB  - Freshwater salinization is receiving increasing global attention due to its profound influence on nitrogen cycling in aquatic ecosystems and the accessibility of water resources. However, a comprehensive understanding of the changes in river salinization and the impacts of salinity on nitrogen cycling in arid and semi-arid regions of China is currently lacking. A meta-analysis was first conducted based on previous investigations and found an intensification in river salinization that altered hydrochemical characteristics. To further analyze the impact of salinity on nitrogen metabolism processes, we evaluated rivers with long-term salinity gradients based on in situ observations. The genes and enzymes that were inhibited generally by salinity, especially those involved in nitrogen fixation and nitrification, showed low abundances in three salinity levels. The abundance of genes and enzymes with denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium functions still maintained a high proportion, especially for denitrification genes/enzymes that were enriched under medium salinity. Denitrifying bacteria exhibited various relationships with salinity, while dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium bacterium (such as Hydrogenophaga and Curvibacter carrying nirB) were more inhibited by salinity, indicating that diverse denitrifying bacteria could be used to regulate nitrogen concentration. Most genera exhibited symbiotic and mutual relationships, and the highest proportion of significant positive correlations of abundant genera was found under medium salinity. This study emphasizes the role of river salinity on environment characteristics and nitrogen transformation rules, and our results are useful for improving the availability of river water resources in arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Symbiotic soil fungi enhance resistance and resilience of an experimental grassland to drought and nitrogen deposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Ecosystem stability is threatened by multiple global change factors such as drought and elevated nitrogen deposition. Yet, it is still poorly understood whether soil organisms can buffer against such perturbations. Here we focus on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a common and widespread group of soil fungi. AMF form symbiotic associations with the majority of terrestrial land plants and promote a range of ecosystem services including plant production, diversity and nutrient cycling.
   We tested whether AMF have the ability to enhance the resistance and resilience of plant communities under soil moisture deficit (hereby drought) and nitrogen deposition. Grassland microcosms with 11 different plant species were established with and without AMF and exposed to elevated nitrogen levels and to an intermittent period of drought.
   Drought strongly reduced plant productivity and nitrogen cycling, but had limited effects on plant diversity. Nitrogen enrichment reduced plant diversity and increased nitrogen leaching and N2O emissions. The presence of AMF enhanced plant productivity, plant diversity and reduced nitrogen losses. AMF facilitated the resistance of plant productivity and nitrogen cycling to drought and the recovery of the plant community structure back to its pre drought state. Furthermore, AMF also mitigated the adverse effects of nitrogen enrichment on the resistance of multiple ecosystem functions to drought.
   Synthesis. Our work highlights the integral role of AMF for the stability of ecosystem functioning; AMF are not only able to promote resistance to harsh conditions of global change but also improve resilience by enabling plant communities to recover. These findings underline AMF's insurance capacity to buffer ecosystems against global change.

TI  - Life history strategies to study the succession of H2-oxidizing bacteria and their ecological role along H2 concentration gradients in upland soils
T2  - LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The recent discovery of atmospheric chemosynthesis has caused a paradigm shift in the way H2-oxidizing bacteria (HOB) are examined. The field has transitioned from the consideration of HOB as a specialized functional group benefiting from the energy potential of H2 for mixotrophic growth or persistence to a versatile group of bacteria using multiple trace gases. We discuss four life history strategies supported by H2, namely chemolithoautotrophic growth, mixotrophic growth, persistence, and atmospheric chemosynthesis. There is experimental evidence supporting the role of HOB in various ecosystem services beyond the uptake of H2 including, for instance, carbon cycling, plant growth promotion, and primary production. Decoupling between the intensity of HOB activation in soil and compositional change of microbial communities remains puzzling, highlighting our poor understanding of the ecological role of HOB. We call for new experimental approaches to delineate the interactions between HOB and the other members of the community. We propose a dedicated framework integrating life history strategies of HOB for mechanistic assessment of microbial interactions and processes supported by H2 in soil.

TI  - Interplanting of Corn (Zea mays L.) Shifts Nitrogen Utilization by Promoting Rhizosphere Microbial Nitrogen Nitrification
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Interplanting is an efficient method of improving nutrient utilization. However, the impact of intraspecific interplanting on rhizosphere microbial nitrogen cycling needs to be studied further. In this study, two corn cultivars were selected as the materials: Zhengdan958 (ZD958, high nitrogen use efficiency) and Denghai3622 (DH3622, low nitrogen use efficiency). Three planting patterns (interplanting, ZD958 monocropping, and DH3622 monocropping) were set up to study the effects of interplanting on crop growth and rhizosphere microbial nitrogen cycle function under two nitrogen levels: low nitrogen (140 kg N ha(-1)) and normal nitrogen (280 kg N ha(-1)). The results showed that the grain yield and nitrogen content in interplanting were significantly increased due to an enhanced leaf area index and root dry weight. The nitrogen accumulation and nitrogen use efficiency were enhanced by 8.14% and 19.38% in interplanting, which resulted in reductions in NH4+ and NO3- content in the rhizosphere. Interplanting enhanced rhizosphere nitrogen cycling processes; nitrification, denitrification, and nitrate reduction were increased. This study demonstrated that interplanting promotes corn nitrogen acquisition from the soil and indirectly regulates rhizosphere microbial function. These findings imply that the intraspecific interplanting of crops with appropriate functional traits is a promising approach to establishing diversified, productive, and efficient resource utilization ecosystems.

TI  - Latitude and pH driven trends in the molecular composition of DOM across a north south transect along the Yenisei River
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
AB  - We used electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS) to identify the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected from different ecosystems along a transect crossing Siberia's northern and middle Taiga. This information is urgently needed to help elucidate global carbon cycling and export through Russian rivers. In total, we analyzed DOM samples from eleven Yenisei tributaries and seven bogs. Freeze-dried and re-dissolved DOM was desalted via solid phase extraction (SPE) and eluted in methanol for ESI-FT-ICR- MS measurements. We recorded 15209 different masses and identified 7382 molecular formulae in the mass range between m/z = 150 and 800. We utilized the relative FT-ICR-MS signal intensities of 3384 molecular formulae above a conservatively set limit of detection and summarized the molecular characteristics for each measurement using ten magnitudeweighted parameters ((O/C)(w), (H/C)(w), (N/C)(w), (DBE)(w), (DBE/C)(w), (DBE/O)(w), (DBE-O) w, (C#) w, (MW) w and (AI) w) for redundancy analysis. Consequently, we revealed that the molecular composition of DOM depends mainly on pH and geographical latitude. After applying variation partitioning to the peak data, we isolated molecular formulae that were strongly positive or negatively correlated with latitude and pH. We used the chemical information from 13 parameters (C#, H#, N#, O#, O/C, H/C, DBE, DBE/C, DBE/O, AI, N/C, DBE-O and MW) to characterize the extracted molecular formulae. Using latitude along the gradient representing climatic variation, we found a higher abundance of smaller molecules, nitrogen-containing compounds and unsaturated C=C functionalities at higher latitudes. As possible reasons for the different molecular characteristics occurring along this gradient, we suggested that the decomposition was temperature dependent resulting to a higher abundance of non-degraded lignin-derived phenolic substances. We demonstrated that bog samples, which were differentiated from river samples by their lower pH values, distinguish themselves by their higher unsaturation and molecular size. These molecular characteristics might suggest less phenol oxidase degradation occurs alongside a higher abundance of phenolic substances in bogs due to low pH and anoxic conditions. We concluded that heating at the higher latitudes will increase decomposition and feedback on the nitrogen cycle due to the increased mineralization of organic nitrogen compounds, although the peat system will be less affected due to pH inhibition.

TI  - Viral community structure and functional potential vary with lifestyle and altitude in soils of Mt. Everest
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - More and more focus has been placed on the processes by which viruses interact with bacteria to influence the biogeochemical cycles. The intricacy of soil matrix and the incompleteness of databases, however, constrains the investigation on the mechanisms of soil viruses exerting ecological functions. The modification of ICTV classification system in 2021 was also a huge shock to the results of the existing studies on virome. We used viral metagenomes combined with soil properties to investigate the viral community composition and auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) profiles of various lifestyles in soils of Mount Everest at different altitudes. Viral lifestyles and soil nutrient levels were found to significantly influence the diversity and composition of viral communities. Temperate virus lifestyle dominated in high-altitude soils with lower level of nutrients because of its stronger survival adaptability, and the structural and functional diversity of viral communities was positively correlated with the contents of nutrients (total carbon and total nitrogen). The primary types of AMGs carried by temperate and virulent viruses differed, while a variety of genes involved in carbon metabolism highlighted the potential importance of viruses in the soil carbon cycle of Mount Everest. Moreover, the abundance of AMGs encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes had a significant and positive correlation with soil C/N ratio. Overall, these findings provide a context for further exploration on the regulatory mechanisms of viruses in carbon cycle via interactions with microorganisms.

TI  - Phosphorus strategy alters mechanism of microbial stress caused by soil arsenic contamination
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Phosphorus and arsenic, as elements of the same main group, co-existing affected soil microbial-mediated transformations of arsenic and phosphorus, thereby altering arsenic toxicity and phosphorus availability. Understanding the effects of changes in concentrations on microbial arsenic metabolism and phosphorus cycling is important for controlling arsenic pollution. In this study, we investigated the microbial communities and functions of arsenic-metabolism and phosphorus-cycling microorganisms in soils surrounding gold mines with moderate and very high available phosphorus concentrations, and high, moderate and low arsenic concentrations. The results showed that in soils with high available phosphorus concentrations, the cooperation between microorganisms combining arsenic-metabolism and phosphorus-cycling was closer. Key microorganisms contribute significantly to both arsenic detoxification and phosphorus solubilization functions. In soils with low available phosphorus concentrations, there was a positive correlation between microbial arsenic metabolism genes abundance and organic phosphorus mineralization phnI abundance. These genes were also positively correlated with arsenic concentration. This suggests that microbial phosphorus activation functions may be an

TI  - Tuber melanosporum Vittad. abundance and specific soil parameters predict soil enzymatic activity in wild and managed truffle producing systems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil microorganisms are able to produce extracellular enzymes and are crucial for ecosystem processes like decomposition and nutrient cycling. The black truffle ( Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) is a highly valued ectomycorrhizal edible fungus. It exerts a strong allelopathic effect, creating a burnt area around the host tree that impacts soil biotic and abiotic properties, and likely affects soil functioning as well. This study investigated the influence of black truffle abundance on soil functions, at different seasons and truffle-producing systems. A regional field design was set up in black truffle productive plantations and forests across the natural distribution area of this fungus in Spain. Physico-chemical soil properties, potential soil enzymatic activities related with carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen cycling, and soil fungal richness and abundance were determined. Black truffle- producing forests generally exhibited lower enzymatic activity compared to plantations, except for chitinase. Besides greater soil enzymatic activity -mainly related with rapid carbon and nitrogen turnover- was observed in late spring than autumn, independently of the type of truffle producing system. Our findings revealed a significant negative impact of black truffle abundance on soil enzymatic activities, and particularly on those involved in carbon and nitrogen mobilisation. Besides the strong local site effect, other biotic and abiotic factors differently impacted soil functioning in truffle forests (Mg) and plantations (Ascomycetes richness, CaCO3, Na). These results offer insights into the ecology and functionality of host-truffle-soil interactions and provide valuable information for optimising management practices in black truffle plantations.

TI  - Tree diversity effects on litter decomposition are mediated by litterfall and microbial processes
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Forest ecosystems are critical for their carbon sequestration potential. Increasing tree diversity has been shown to enhance both forest productivity and litter decomposition. Litter diversity increases litter decomposability by increasing the diversity of substrates offered to decomposers. However, the relative importance of litter decomposability and decomposer community in mediating tree diversity effects on decomposition remains unknown. Moreover, tree diversity modulation of litterfall spatial distribution, and consequently litter decomposition, has rarely been tested. We studied tree diversity effects on leaf litter decomposition and its mediation by the amount of litterfall, litter species richness and decomposability, and soil microorganisms in a large-scale tree diversity experiment in subtropical China. Furthermore, we examined how litter functional identity and diversity affect leaf litter decomposability. Finally, we tested how leaf functional traits, tree biomass, and forest spatial structure drive the litterfall spatial distribution. We found evidence that tree species richness increased litter decomposition by increasing litter species richness and the amount of litterfall. We showed that soil microorganisms in this subtropical forest perform 84-87% of litter decomposition. Moreover, changes in the amount of litterfall and microbial decomposition explained 19-37% of the decomposition variance. Additionally, up to 20% of the microbial decomposition variance was explained by litter decomposability, while litter decomposability itself was determined by litter functional identity, diversity, and species richness. Tree species richness increased litter species richness and the amount of litterfall (+200% from monoculture to eight-species neighborhood). We further demonstrated that the amount of species-specific litterfall increased with increasing tree proximity and biomass, and was modulated by leaf functional traits. These litterfall drivers increased the spatial heterogeneity of litter distribution, and thus litter decomposition. We highlighted multiple biomass- and diversity-mediated effects of tree diversity on ecosystem properties driving forest nutrient cycling. We conclude that considering spatial variability in biotic properties will improve our mechanistic understanding of ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Disproportionate microbial responses to decadal drainage on a Siberian floodplain
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Permafrost thaw induces soil hydrological changes which in turn affects carbon cycle processes in the Arctic terrestrial ecosystems. However, hydrological impacts of thawing permafrost on microbial processes and greenhouse gas (GHG) dynamics are poorly understood. This study examined changes in microbial communities using gene and genome-centric metagenomics on an Arctic floodplain subject to decadal drainage, and linked them to CO2 and CH4 flux and soil chemistry. Decadal drainage led to significant changes in the abundance, taxonomy, and functional potential of microbial communities, and these modifications well explained the changes in CO2 and CH4 fluxes between ecosystem and atmosphere-increased fungal abundances potentially increased net CO2 emission rates and highly reduced CH4 emissions in drained sites corroborated the marked decrease in the abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs. Interestingly, various microbial taxa disproportionately responded to drainage: Methanoregula, one of the key players in methanogenesis under saturated conditions, almost disappeared, and also Methylococcales methanotrophs were markedly reduced in response to drainage. Seven novel methanogen population genomes were recovered, and the metabolic reconstruction of highly correlated population genomes revealed novel syntrophic relationships between methanogenic archaea and syntrophic partners. These results provide a mechanistic view of microbial processes regulating GHG dynamics in the terrestrial carbon cycle, and disproportionate microbial responses to long-term drainage provide key information for understanding the effects of warming-induced soil drying on microbial processes in Arctic wetland ecosystems.

TI  - New directions in black carbon organic geochemistry
T2  - MARINE CHEMISTRY
CP  - Symposium on New Approaches in Marine Organic Biogeochemistry held in Honor of the Life and Science of John I Hedges
AB  - In the past 30 years, the field of black carbon (BC) research has expanded broadly, stretching from its traditional core in the atmospheric sciences into oceanography, soil science, and even anthropology. Results produced in this period of expansion have been exciting: BC has been detected in many important geochemical pools, and interesting new research directions open as we learn about the role of this byproduct of biomass burning in the carbon cycle. Especially important research directions will be the quantification of BC loss processes (both biotic and abiotic), measurement of BC decomposition products in environmentally relevant reservoirs, and exploration of the interactions between BC and its host organo-mineral matrix, including the role of BC in pedogenesis.
   However, along with exciting results, we have also seen apparent discrepancies between BC studies. These discrepancies occur at least in part because of a lack of a common language, common methods, and a common model of BC. This paper lays out the framework many BC researchers use to understand the role of BC in the carbon cycle, discussing the 'combustion continuum' BC model and the methodological continuum that this model implies.

TI  - Progress and prospects in understanding the effects of forest management practices on soil nitrogen cycling
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) cycling plays a pivotal role in forest ecosystem productivity and nutrient regulation. This and highlights future research priorities for elucidating underlying mechanisms and optimising forest ecosystem functioning (Figure 1). Management interventions such as thinning, species composition adjustment, and understory vegetation control have been shown to affect N inputs and transformation pathways by modifying litter quality, microbial community structure, and N-cycling enzyme activities. However, current findings remain inconsistent, and mechanistic insights are still limited. Future research should focus on disentangling the multi-scale, multifactorial interactions through which forest management regulates soil N cycling. Integrative approaches that link molecular biology with ecosystem-level processes are needed to clarify the interplay among microbial dynamics, enzyme activity, root exudates, and soil physicochemical properties across spatial and temporal scales. In addition, research should explore how forest management affects community structure, litter inputs, soil aggregation, and subsurface biochemical processes to reveal the synergistic regulation of nitrogen cycling by biological, physical, and chemical drivers. Establishing long-term monitoring networks across a range of forest types and climatic regimes, combined with tools such as metagenomics, high-throughput sequencing, and stable isotope tracing, will enable the precise characterisation of key nitrogen-cycling genes and fluxes. In the context of global environmental change, it is also crucial to assess how forest management modulates the coupling of nitrogen, carbon, and water cycles and the resultant ecological feedbacks.

TI  - Unraveling microbial processes involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling and greenhouse gas emissions in rewetted peatlands by molecular biology
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Restoration of drained peatlands through rewetting has recently emerged as a prevailing strategy to mitigate excessive greenhouse gas emissions and re-establish the vital carbon sequestration capacity of peatlands. Rewetting can help to restore vegetation communities and biodiversity, while still allowing for extensive agricultural management such as paludiculture. Belowground processes governing carbon fluxes and greenhouse gas dynamics are mediated by a complex network of microbial communities and processes. Our understanding of this complexity and its multi-factorial controls in rewetted peatlands is limited. Here, we summarize the research regarding the role of soil microbial communities and functions in driving carbon and nutrient cycling in rewetted peatlands including the use of molecular biology techniques in understanding biogeochemical processes linked to greenhouse gas fluxes. We emphasize that rapidly advancing molecular biology approaches, such as high-throughput sequencing, are powerful tools helping to elucidate the dynamics of key biogeochemical processes when combined with isotope tracing and greenhouse gas measuring techniques. Insights gained from the gathered studies can help inform efficient monitoring practices for rewetted peatlands and the development of climate-smart restoration and management strategies.

TI  - Rhizosphere effects on soil nutrient dynamics and microbial activity in an Australian tropical lowland rainforest
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Via vast exchanges of energy, water, carbon, and nutrients, tropical forests are a major driving force in the regulation of Earth's biogeochemical, hydrological, and climatic cycles. Given the critical role of rhizosphere processes in nutrient cycling, it is likely that rhizosphere processes in tropical rainforests form a major component of the biome's interactions with global cycles. Little is known, however, about rhizospheric processes in rainforest soils. In order to investigate the influence of rhizosphere processes upon rainforest nutrient cycling, we compared the nutrient status and microbial activity of rhizospheric soil from Australian lowland tropical rainforest with that of the surrounding bulk soil. We found a marked difference in the biological and chemical nature of the rhizosphere and bulk soils. Total carbon, microbial biomass carbon, total nitrogen, soluble nitrogen, and a suite of trace element concentrations, alongside microbial respiration and the rate and diversity of carbon substrate use, were all significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil than the bulk soil. Rhizosphere soil delta(15)N was significantly lower than that of the bulk soil. Ratios of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur differed significantly between the rhizosphere and bulk soil. These clear differences suggest that rhizosphere processes strongly influence nutrient cycling in lowland tropical rainforest, and are likely to play an important role in its interaction with global cycles. This role may be under-represented with composite sampling of rhizosphere and bulk soil. Further research is required regarding the mechanisms of rainforest rhizospheric processes and their relationship with ecosystem productivity, stability, and environmental change.

TI  - Microbial response time to sugar and amino acid additions to soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil microbial respiration is derived predominantly from the turnover of carbohydrates and proteins in soil. In most agricultural ecosystems, these C compounds enter soil mainly from rhizodeposition (root exudation and turnover). Our aim was to determine how long it takes for the microbial population to reach their maximum mineralization potential after the addition of low-molecular-weight (MW) rhizodeposits to the soil. We added sugar in the form of glucose and amino acids in the form of glycine to an arable, grazed grassland, Eucalyptus forest and boreal forest soil and monitored CO2 efflux over a 6-h period. Artificial rainwater amended (zero C addition) or unamended soils were used as controls. The Michaelis-Menten substrate utilization profiles showed vastly different patterns of microbial mineralization capacity and substrate affinity between the soils. However, in all soils we showed that activation of the soil microbial community to C addition occurred almost instantaneously (<= 60s) with the average time taken to reach half maximal CO2 production being 14 +/- 8 min for glucose and 10 +/- 8 min for glycine. After reaching their maximal mineralization potential, the rate of CO2 evolution remained constant for the remainder of the experiment. Our results showed that while substrate uptake and mineralization within the soil microbial biomass was activated quickly, subsequent adaptation and upregulation of its C processing capacity did not occur at least in the short term. The fast rate of microbial activation and Substrate use we partially attribute to the large degree of functional redundancy that exists within the soil microbial community for processing rhizodeposits.

TI  - Estimating the Importance of Viral Contributions to Soil Carbon Dynamics
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Biogeochemical models for predicting carbon dynamics increasingly include microbial processes, reflecting the importance of microorganisms in regulating the movement of carbon between soils and the atmosphere. Soil viruses can redirect carbon among various chemical pools, indicating a need for quantification and development soil carbon models that explicitly represent viral dynamics. In this opinion, we derive a global estimate of carbon potentially released from microbial biomass by viral infections in soils and synthesize a quantitative soil carbon budget from existing literature that explicitly includes viral impacts. We then adapt known mechanisms by which viruses influence carbon cycles in marine ecosystems into a soil-explicit framework. Finally, we explore the diversity of virus-host interactions during infection and conceptualize how infection mode may impact soil carbon fate. Our synthesis highlights key knowledge gaps hindering the incorporation of viruses into soil carbon cycling research and generates specific hypotheses to test in the pursuit of better quantifying microbial dynamics that explain ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes. The importance of identifying critical drivers behind soil carbon dynamics, including these elusive but likely pervasive viral mechanisms of carbon redistribution, becomes more pressing with climate change.

T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) alter soil properties and plant physiology and pose a significant risk to crop health and food quality. This study assessed the effects of MPs (polyamide-PA, low-density polyethylene-LDPE, and polypropylene-PP) on Andisol and Raphanus sativus L. as a model plant. Plant characteristics, including growth, chlorophyll content, oxidative stress, antioxidant capacity, and bioactive compound profiles, were evaluated. In addition, the effects on soil nutrients, microbiological properties, and bacterial nitrogen-cycling gene abundance were studied, revealing alterations in both soil and plants. Soil pH increased up to 4.3%, whereas dissolved organic carbon and polyphenol levels decreased, particularly in the PA (26%) and PP (29%) treatments. LDPE and PP increased beta-glucosidase activity (14% and 23%, respectively) and basal soil respiration (25% and 26%, respectively). Nitrogen-cycling genes nifH, amoA, and nirS were notably more abundant in PP-treated soils, with increases of 79%, 76%, and 62%, respectively. In R. sativus , PA and LDPE increased SPAD values by 9.9% and increased biomass in rootlets (155% in PA, 60% in LDPE) and radishes (125% in PP). Oxidative stress levels in radishes increased by 63% and 73% after exposure to LDPE and PP, respectively. MPs altered glucosinolate profiles in leaves and rootlets. Furthermore, PA and LDPE modified anthocyanin profiles in leaves, whereas PP altered the profile in radishes. This study highlights the impact of MPs on soil and plant physiology, identifying polyphenols and microbial biomass carbon as key predictors of R. sativus response.

TI  - The impact of Pentaclethra macroloba on soil microbial nitrogen fixing communities and nutrients within developing secondary forests in the Northern Zone of Costa Rica
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - In the current study, we showed that Pentaclethra macroloba appears to influence the microbial communities within the soil of secondary forests in the Northern Zone of Costa Rica. The soil closest to the Pentaclethra macroloba trees ("tree soil") had a lower abundance of the N-fixing bacteria Frankia, but greater amounts of both nifH gene and Rhizobium than soils furthest away ("forest soils"). These soils also had greater amounts of microbial biomass and were more efficient at organic carbon use as indicated by lower metabolic quotient values (qCO(2)). This suggests that the use of Pentaclethra macroloba in restoration of soils from harvested forests may provide a good strategy for recuperating nitrogen in the soils due to its association with N-fixing bacteria near the roots of the trees and in the nearby soils. As well, these trees were associated with enhanced microbial biomass, microbial activity, and microbial mediated enhanced efficiency of C use into the biomass, suggesting their value in improving soil richness. A tangential discovery during this study was that it was the first, to our knowledge to show the presence of Frankia in association with Pentaclethra macroloba. It is interesting to note that significant amounts of Frankia were found throughout the soils in this study, and it was present in all sites at levels far greater than Rhizobium. It is likely that Frankia is more critical in recuperating soil N within these developing secondary forests.

TI  - Influence of chemical fumigation and biofumigation on soil nitrogen cycling processes and nitrifier and denitrifier abundance
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Chemical fumigation and biofumigation are used to reduce soil-borne diseases in agricultural production systems; however, other essential soil processes such as the soil nitrogen (N) cycle may also be affected. This study compared the effects of chemical fumigation and biofumigation on soil net N mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, and soil nitrifier and denitrifier abundance. Six treatments were compared using soil microcosms over a 160-day incubation period: fumigation with chloropicrin; fumigation with metam sodium used alone (MS) or combined with barley plant residues (MSBR); biofumigation with mustard residues; addition of nonbiofumigant barley residues; and an untreated control. Biofumigation did not inhibit soil nitrification, whereas chemical fumigation with MS (with or without barley) and chloropicrin inhibited nitrification for 16 and 64 days, respectively. Biofumigation, barley residues, and MSBR increased soil respiration, N2O emission, and denitrification rates. However, biofumigation had lower denitrification and N2O cumulative emissions and rates compared to barley residues, suggesting that biofumigation may reduce N2O production pathways. All chemical fumigation treatments significantly decreased nitrifier gene abundance compared to biofumigation; however, only chloropicrin decreased the abundance of denitrifying genes. After 160 days, 22% of the added plant residue dry matter remained in the MSBR-treated soil, which was similar to 2-fold greater than the barley-treated soil, indicating chemical fumigation may also affect the carbon cycle. Overall, these results suggest that chemical fumigation, especially with chloropicrin, has a greater impact on nitrification and nitrifier and denitrifier gene abundance than biofumigation with mustard residues.

TI  - Warming counteracts grazing effects on the functional structure of the soil microbial community in a Tibetan grassland
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Grazing intensity and global warming are expected to increase in the forthcoming decades, with uncertain consequences for their interaction on grassland ecosystems and their functions. We investigated the effects of warming, grazing and their interaction in a factorial warming (+1.2-1.7 degrees C) and grazing (moderate intensity with ca. 50% vegetation consumption) experiment in a Tibetan alpine meadow on microbial communities by studying functional genes involved in soil carbon and nitrogen cycles, using GeoChip technology. Our results showed that microbial functional gene structure and abundances were largely affected by the interactive effect of grazing and warming, rather than the main effect of warming or grazing. Compared to the control, grazing alone significantly increased the functional gene alpha diversity, changed the overall functional community structure, and increased the abundances of C fixation, C degradation, N mineralization and denitrification genes, likely due to the stimulating impact of urine and dung deposition. Warming alone did not change these microbial properties, possibly related to the unchanged soil nutrient status. Despite an increase in soil NO3- concentrations and the deposition of urine and dung, the combined treatment did not change functional gene alpha diversity, community structure, or C/N cycling gene abundances, possibly resulting from the limiting effect of water depletion in the combined treatment. Our study revealed antagonistic interactions between warming and grazing on microbial functional gene structure and abundances, which remained stable under the moderate intensity of grazing in future warming scenario in the Tibetan alpine meadow, raising potentially important implications for predicting future soil carbon and nitrogen processes in these systems.

TI  - Response of cbbL Carbon-Sequestering Microorganisms to Simulated Warming in the River Source Wetland of the Wayan Mountains
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - As a globally critical carbon reservoir, the response mechanism of wetland ecosystems to climate change on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has attracted significant scientific scrutiny. This study investigated the temperature sensitivity of cbbL-harboring carbon-sequestering microbial communities and their coupling with carbon-nitrogen cycle dynamics through a simulated field warming experiment conducted in the Wayan Mountains' river source wetland in the northeastern QTP. Key findings revealed that warming markedly elevated Alpha diversity (ACE and Chao1 indices), whereas Shannon and Simpson indices remained stable, indicating that temperature increases primarily altered community composition by enhancing species richness rather than evenness. Taxonomic analysis demonstrated significant increases in the relative abundances of Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria, while Proteobacteria retained dominance but exhibited reduced relative abundance. At the genus level, Thioflexothrix, Ferrithrix, and Rhodospirillum dominated the community, with Thioflexothrix and Ferrithrix showing warming-induced abundance increments. Functional predictions indicated that warming preferentially stimulated heterotrophic and photoheterotrophic functional guilds. Soil physicochemical analyses further revealed warming-driven increases in nitrate nitrogen (NN), total carbon (TC), and total nitrogen (TN), concurrent with decreased soil moisture. Redundancy analysis identified TC as the predominant determinant of microbial community structure (followed by TN > NN), while pH and ammonium nitrogen (AN) exerted comparatively limited influence. Strong positive correlations between microbial communities and carbon/nitrogen indicators suggested that enhanced carbon-nitrogen resource availability served as the central driver of community succession. These findings elucidate the temperature-responsive mechanisms of cbbL-type carbon-sequestering microorganisms in alpine wetlands, offering critical insights for the adaptive management of carbon cycling in high-altitude ecosystems and advancing strategies toward achieving carbon neutrality goals.

TI  - Microsite Determines the Soil Nitrogen and Carbon Mineralization in Response to Nitrogen Addition in a Temperate Desert
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Nitrogen deposition can change the soil in N and C cycling processes. However, a general understanding of how N deposition changes C and N mineralization has not yet been reached. Soil organic C and N mineralization beneath the dominant shrubs of Haloxylon ammodendron and between the shrubs in response to two levels of N addition (2.5 gN m(-2) and 5 gN m(-2) per year) were investigated in the 1st, 4th, and 9th year of N addition in a temperate desert of northern China. N addition promoted soil N mineralization (RmN), and the nitrification rate (R-NN) increased C mineralization in the interplant and decreased it beneath shrubs. N addition increased soil microbial biomass C (C-mic), N (N-mic), and PLFAs in the interplant, and decreased it beneath shrubs. RmN and R-NN were related to N-mic, and R-CM was related to C-mic and the total PLFAs. N addition increased the fungal biomass alongside the ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs in the interplants while decreasing them beneath shrubs. Our results support how N addition can increase soil N mineralization and nitrification, but the effects on soil C mineralization are dependent on the amount of nitrogen addition, the soil's available carbon content, and water. Finally, the divergent responses of microbial communities to N addition between microsites suggest that the "fertile islands" effects on nutrients and microbial biomass are important when estimating feedbacks of C and N cycling to projected N deposition in the desert ecosystem.

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of nitrogen fixing, nitrifying and denitrifying microbes in an unfertilized grassland soil
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The microbial groups of nitrogen fixers, ammonia oxidizers, and denitrifiers largely drive the inorganic nitrogen cycle in temperate terrestrial ecosystems. Their spatial and temporal dynamics, however, vary depending on the studied scale. The present study aimed to fill a knowledge gap by providing an explicit picture of spatial and temporal dynamics of a subset of these soil microorganisms at the plot scale. We selected an unfertilized perennial grassland, where nitrogen cycling is considered to be efficient and tightly coupled to plant growth. At six times over one growing season 60 soil samples were taken from a 10 m x 10 m area and abundances of marker genes for total archaea and bacteria (16S rRNA), nitrogen fixing bacteria (nifH), ammonia oxidizing archaea (amoA AOA) and bacteria (amoA AOB), and denitrifying bacteria (nirS, nirK and nosZ) were determined by qPCR. Potential nitrification activity (PNA) and denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) were determined. Seasonal changes in abundance patterns of marker genes were detected, and were associated with changes in substrate availability associated with plant growth stages. Potential nitrification and denitrification enzyme activities were strongly spatially structured at the studied scale, corresponding to periods of rapid plant growth, June and October, and their spatial distributions were similar, providing visual evidence of highly localized spatial and temporal conditions at this scale. Temporal variability in the N -cycling communities versus the stability of their respective potential activities provided evidence of both short-lived temporal niche partitioning and a degree of microbial functional redundancy. Our results indicate that in an unfertilized grassland, at the meter scale, abundances of microbial N-cycling organisms can exhibit transient changes, while nitrogen cycling processes remain stable.

TI  - The Fungal Contribution to the Nitrogen Cycle in Agricultural Soils
T2  - METAGENOMICS OF THE MICROBIAL NITROGEN CYCLE: THEORY, METHODS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Nitrate assimilation and its regulation is well studied for several model fungi but little is known about the fungal contribution to microbial nitrogen cycles in agricultural soils, although fungal dominated systems are less prone to nitrogen losses via leaching and denitrification. Tools were recently developed to characterize gene pools and expression levels of fungal assimilatory nitrate reductases in environmental samples and carbon source availability was identified as one of the major parameter determining nitrate assimilation capacities. Even though the majority of the environmental sequences could be classified to family, genus or species level, a considerably high number could only be assigned to higher taxonomic levels. Ongoing addition of new fungal nitrate reductase genes from whole genome sequencing efforts and from PCR amplification from pure culture isolates already led to improved affiliation of environmental sequences. Precaution is however necessary in the interpretation of higher order affiliations: Horizontal gene transfer events seem to be rather common in the evolution of fungal nitrate assimilation. No fungal nitrate reductases are found in publicly accessible soil metagenomic and metatranscriptomic libraries. Future studies will focus on integration of data from metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, stable isotope probing, isotope pool dilution assays and modelling approaches. The goal of these studies is to obtain a comprehensive picture of the fungal contribution to the soil microbial nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Modelling nitrous oxide emissions from grazed grassland systems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Grazed grassland systems are an important component of the global carbon cycle and also influence global climate change through their emissions of nitrous oxide and methane. However, there are huge uncertainties and challenges in the development and parameterisation of process-based models for grazed grassland systems because of the wide diversity of vegetation and impacts of grazing animals. A process-based biogeochemistry model, DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), has been modified to describe N2O emissions for the UK from regional conditions. This paper reports a new development of UK-DNDC in which the animal grazing practices were modified to track their contributions to the soil nitrogen (N) biogeochemistry. The new version of UK-DNDC was tested against datasets of N2O fluxes measured at three contrasting field sites. The results showed that the responses of the model to changes in grazing parameters were generally in agreement with observations, showing that N2O emissions increased as the grazing intensity increased.

TI  - Mineralisation and sorption of dissolved organic nitrogen compounds in litter and soil from sugarcane fields
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) represents an important soluble nutrient pool in soil, however, little is known about the dynamics of DON in the litter and topsoil of Brazilian sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) fields, particularly those that are harvested mechanically, without burning. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the microbial mineralisation and sorption affinity of DON compounds in litter and soil from the litter-soil transition zone of two sugarcane plantations located in southeastern Brazil. We directly measured the C mineralisation of C-14-labelled amino acids (mix of 17 amino acids), peptides (L-dialanine and L-trialanine), urea, and protein (isolated from tobacco leaves) by capturing (CO2)-C-14 evolved from the litter and soil over 168 h. A sorption assay was performed using the same treatments. We found differences in the organic and mineral N pools of the litter and soil, as well as in microbial community composition. Except for protein in the soil, the DON compounds were taken up rapidly by microbes. However, the C use efficiency was higher for the amino acid mix than for the peptides and urea, indicating more rapid post-uptake catabolism (with subsequent mineralisation as (CO2)-C-14) of both compounds. In addition, protein had the highest sorption affinity, especially in soil, and the weak sorption affinity of the amino acids, peptides, and urea indicates moderate bioavailability of these fractions to microbes and plants. We conclude that strong sorption of protein to the solid phase limits its bioavailability and represents a rate limiting step in DON turnover. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Global climate change and its impacts on the terrestrial Arctic carbon cycle with special regards to ecosystem components and the greenhouse-gas balance
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - The climatic changes on earth may have serious implications for the carbon (C) cycle in the terrestrial Arctic throughout the 21st century. Arctic vegetation takes up carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere producing biomass. In a cold and often moist soil environment, dead organic matter is preferentially preserved as soil organic matter (SOM) due to the inhibition of decomposition processes. However, viable soil microbes exhale huge amounts of CO2 and methane (CH4) annually. Hence, Arctic ecosystems exhibit annual fluxes of both carbon-based (CO2 and CH4) greenhouse gases (GHGs) that are in an order of magnitude of millions of tons. Rising Arctic temperatures lead to the degradation of much of today's permafrost in the long run. As a result, large quantities of frozen SOM may become available for decomposers, and GHGs that are entrapped in permafrost may be released. At the same time, warming tends to stimulate the growth, development, and reproduction of many Arctic plants, at least transiently. The present northward migration of boreal shrubs and trees into southern tundra areas may be amplified by that, increasing the ecosystems' gross primary production and, thus, their C sequestration. On the other hand, rising temperatures boost SOM decomposition and microbial respiration rates. In general, soil temperature and soil moisture are key environmental variables to control the, intensity of aerobic and anaerobic respiration by microbes, and autotrophic respiration by plants. On the basis of published data on Arctic CO2 and CH4 fluxes, the calculations on the terrestrial C-based Arctic GHG balance made in this review reveal a current annual GHG exchange that ranges between a weak storage of <= 225 Tg CO2 equivalent (eq.) y(-1) and a huge release of 1990 Tg CO2 eq. y(-1). Hence, the Arctic GHG balance does apparently already contribute positively to the climatic changes at present. Regarding the future, the relative development of the uptake and release of CO2 and CH4 by northern ecosystems is fundamental to the overall GHG status of the Arctic under scenarios of continued climate change.

TI  - Nutrients cause consolidation of soil carbon flux to small proportion of bacterial community
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - The fate of soil carbon depends on microbial processes, but whether different microbial taxa have individualistic effects on carbon fluxes is unknown. Here the authors use 16 S amplicon sequencing and stable isotopes to show how taxonomic differences influence bacterial respiration and carbon cycling across four ecosystems.
   Nutrient amendment diminished bacterial functional diversity, consolidating carbon flow through fewer bacterial taxa. Here, we show strong differences in the bacterial taxa responsible for respiration from four ecosystems, indicating the potential for taxon-specific control over soil carbon cycling. Trends in functional diversity, defined as the richness of bacteria contributing to carbon flux and their equitability of carbon use, paralleled trends in taxonomic diversity although functional diversity was lower overall. Among genera common to all ecosystems, Bradyrhizobium, the Acidobacteria genus RB41, and Streptomyces together composed 45-57% of carbon flow through bacterial productivity and respiration. Bacteria that utilized the most carbon amendment (glucose) were also those that utilized the most native soil carbon, suggesting that the behavior of key soil taxa may influence carbon balance. Mapping carbon flow through different microbial taxa as demonstrated here is crucial in developing taxon-sensitive soil carbon models that may reduce the uncertainty in climate change projections.

TI  - Effects of vegetation degradation on soil microbial communities and ecosystem multifunctionality in a karst region, southwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Vegetation degradation caused by intense human disturbances poses a significant challenge to the preservation and improvement of ecosystem functions and services in the karst region of southwest China. Soil microorganisms are major regulators of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). Currently, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the effects of vegetation degradation on soil microbial communities and their corresponding multiple ecosystem functions in karst regions. In this study, we selected the vegetation degradation sequences of second natural forest (NF), agroforestry (AS) and cropland (CL) to investigate the diversity of bacterial, fungal and protistan communities, and their hierarchical co-occurrence network, and EMF to explore the relationships between them. Compared to the NF, the carbon cycling index, nitrogen cycling index, soil water regulation power, and the EMF were significantly decreased by 8.2%-50.6%, 48.7%-86.8%, 19.8%-24.5%, and 31.4%- 69.5% in the AS and CL, respectively. The development of EMF can be explained by the fungal, protistan and microbial hierarchical beta-diversity, as well as the complexity (e.g. degree) of microbial hierarchical interactions during the process of vegetation degradation. Notably, correlations between the abundances of sensitive amplicon sequence variants (sASVs) for different karst vegetation types and EMF varied in distinct network modules, being positive in module 1 and negative in module 2. Moreover, the relative abundance of keystone taxa in fungal and protistan communities provided greater contributions to EMF than the bacterial communities. Additionally, random forest modeling showed that carbon and nitrogen sources, and soil water content, and trace elements (e.g. exchangeable magnesium, iron, manganese, and zinc) were identified as key driving factors of the EMF. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that vegetation degradation obviously alters soil microbial diversities and hierarchical interactions, emphasizing their key role in maintaining ecosystem functions and health in karst regions.

TI  - Resource Availability Effects on Nitrate-Reducing Microbial Communities in a Freshwater Wetland
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - Microbial communities in freshwater wetland soils process nitrate via denitrification (DNF) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Because the processes generate different end products (N-gas versus NH4 (+)), the relative dominance of DNF versus DNRA has implications for ecosystem nitrogen cycling, greenhouse gas production, and downstream eutrophication. To examine how resource availability affects these two microbial groups, wetland soil was supplemented with labile (compost) or recalcitrant (wood) organic matter (OM) and/or potassium nitrate fertilizer. Following a three-month in situ incubation, the abundance and composition of the DNF- and DNRA-capable microbes were examined via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) using process-specific functional genes (DNF: nirS qPCR, nosZ T-RFLP; DNRA: nrfA qPCR and T-RFLP). Denitrifer abundance was positively related to OM lability and simultaneous nitrate amendment enhanced OM effects, while DNRA abundance varied little across treatments. For both groups, community structure showed an interactive response to OM type and nitrate availability, even when abundances did not change. This work highlights the importance of considering co-varying resource gradients, and the differential responses of DNF and DNRA communities to resource manipulation provides insight into the environmental regulators of ecosystem nitrate removal in wetlands.

TI  - Current Progress and Future Trends in Carbon Sources and Sinks in Farmland Ecosystems: A Bibliometric Analysis (2002-2023)
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Farmland ecosystems, as the most active carbon pool, are integral to global climate change and carbon cycling. Therefore, systematically studying the roles of carbon sources and sinks in farmland ecosystems is essential to deepening our understanding of the carbon cycle and meeting the goals of "peak carbon emissions" and "carbon neutrality" in agriculture. Using the Web of Science database, this study reviewed 1411 articles (2002-2023) via bibliometric analysis to identify key research themes, trends, future priorities and address suggestions for future directions in farmland ecosystem carbon sources and sinks. The main results include the following: (1) Over the past 22 years, global research in this field has shown a consistent growth trend, with remarkably rapid expansion in the past three years. China, the United States, and Germany are the most influential countries. As the research scope has expanded, the field has evolved into an interdisciplinary domain. (2) The diversity of this research area has become enriched, and the research content is becoming more refined and systematic. The main research topics focus on carbon sequestration, soil organic carbon (SOC), farmland management, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon stocks, ecosystem services, land use changes, climate change, and spatiotemporal heterogeneity. (3) Current research hotspots primarily focus on studying soil microbial carbon sequestration mechanisms, the application of remote sensing technologies, and reducing GHG emissions to achieve "carbon neutrality". While existing studies have systematically elucidated carbon sequestration mechanisms mediated by soil aggregates, microorganisms, and minerals, critical knowledge gaps persist. Regional disparities in the relative contributions of these mechanisms remain unresolved, compounded by methodological inconsistencies in carbon assessment that introduce substantial uncertainties. Although farmland management practices are identified as pivotal drivers of carbon flux variation, the interactive effects of anthropogenic interventions and natural factors on ecosystem-scale carbon balance require further mechanistic exploration. This review provides a comprehensive reference for further study on carbon sources and sinks of farmland ecosystems and devising effective emission reduction strategies.

TI  - Plant-induced nutrient enrichment alters microbial carbon cycling gene expression in Pb-Zn contaminated rhizospheres
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsThis study aims to elucidate whether native plants (Carex breviculmis, Buddleja davidii, Artemisia annua) can mediate rhizosphere nutrient enrichment that in turn shapes microbial carbon cycling gene expression in a Pb-Zn waste heap.MethodsRhizosphere soil from colonizing plants were collected and analyzed for nutrient status and C-cycling functional genes via metagenomics.ResultsNative plants significantly enhanced the diversity and restructured C-cycling genes, with A. annua and B. davidii exerting strongest effects. Plant growth, particularly of A. annua and B. davidii, enhanced rhizosphere nutrient content (soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen), thereby elevating resource availability. This resource reconfiguration directly drove microbial community restructuring and their adaptive metabolic strategies: microbes preferentially upregulated the relative abundance of C decomposition-related genes (e.g., Glycoside Hydrolases) while downregulating C biosynthesis-related genes (e.g., Glycosyl Transferases). Consequently, the microbial community transitioned from an oligotrophic-adapted state dominated by taxa reliant on recalcitrant organic matter (e.g., Kitasatosporales) to a copiotrophic-responsive state enriched with taxa favoring labile carbon sources (e.g., Sphingomonadales and Solirubrobacterales). Notably, certain Actinobacteria taxa (e.g., Pseudonocardiales and Micromonosporales) exhibited functional flexibility, maintaining capabilities for degrading complex organic substrates while adaptively responding to rhizosphere resource inputs. This microbial shift helps accelerate organic matter turnover and improve nutrient availability in the metal-contaminated soil.ConclusionThese findings highlight the critical role of plant-microbe interactions in regulating soil carbon cycling and functional resilience in heavy metal-polluted environments, offering a scientific foundation for developing targeted phytoremediation approaches and improving the efficiency of ecological restoration in metal-contaminated areas.

TI  - Microbial Inoculants Modify the Functions of Resident Soil Microbes to Expedite the Field Restoration of the Abandoned Mine
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Global-scale mining activities have had significant deleterious impacts on local ecosystems and the overall environment, which will necessitate robust restoration efforts. A practical approach includes combining microbial inoculants with the technology of external soil spray seeding. This approach holds the potential for sustainable abandoned mine site restoration by enhancing plant growth through the modulation of soil nutrients and microbial communities. Nonetheless, the detailed effects of microbial inoculants on specific aspects of soil microbial community functions and their complex interactions with plant growth remain underexplored, particularly in the context of restoration efforts. To bridge this gap, we performed a four-year field study at an abandoned carbonate mine location, using metagenomic sequencing to evaluate the influence of microbial inoculants on soil microbial functionality. Our research revealed that introducing microbial inoculants greatly enhanced essential soil parameters and notably increased plant biomass. Additionally, these inoculants altered the functional gene makeup of the microbial community, significantly boosting the relative abundance of processes such as nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA), dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA), and organic phosphorus mineralization. Conversely, there was a decrease in the relative abundance of carbon degradation, phosphorus regulation, and transport processes. We observed strong correlations between the abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and plant biomass. Crucially, microbial inoculants affect plant biomass by initially altering soil properties and subsequently coordinating nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. These findings provide valuable insights into the role of microbial inoculants in mine site restoration and offer a theoretical foundation for their broader practical application.

TI  - Different types of land use influence soil physiochemical properties, the abundance of nitrifying bacteria, and microbial interactions in tropical urban soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have led to unexpected changes in microbial community composition and structure, resulting in an interruption of soil ecological roles in urban environments. We questioned the impact of the different land use (e.g., agricultural, industrial, recreational, coastal, and residential areas) on the distribution of nitrifying bacteria and microbial interaction in tropical soil. The dominant nitrifying bacteria were ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in tropical soils up to 107 copies/g of soil, while the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) was significantly higher in agricultural soil only. Comammox (CMX) was ubiquitous up to 105 copies/g of tropical soil, indicating that CMX might share ecological niches with AOA and considerably contribute to nitrification in urban areas. The most abundant phylum is Actinobacteria, accounting for 27-34 % relative abundance among most land-use types, but Proteobacteria was observed as the most prevalent phylum in agricultural soil. The physicochemical properties (e.g., soil pH and nutrient contents) of different types of land use influenced microbial richness and diversities associ-ated with nitrogen cycling. Multivariate analysis disclosed that agricultural soils were distinct from other land uses be-cause of the concentrations of nutrients and heavy metals and the abundance of microorganisms associated with nitrogen cycles. Also, the microbial co-occurrence network revealed that agricultural soils were a highly intercon-nected network of the microbial community. In this study, C: N ratio might have a significant impact on ecological net-works and the abundance of nitrogen-related taxa, which could influence microbial interactions and complexity in tropical soils. Thus, the impact of anthropogenic land use induced changes in microbial composition and diversity, co-occurrence network, and nitrifying bacteria, leading to potential transformation in ecological services of tropical soils and nitrogen cycling in urban environments.

TI  - Simple additive effects are rare: a quantitative review of plant biomass and soil process responses to combined manipulations of CO2 and temperature
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - In recent years, increased awareness of the potential interactions between rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([ CO2 ]) and temperature has illustrated the importance of multifactorial ecosystem manipulation experiments for validating Earth System models. To address the urgent need for increased understanding of responses in multifactorial experiments, this article synthesizes how ecosystem productivity and soil processes respond to combined warming and [ CO2 ] manipulation, and compares it with those obtained in single factor [ CO2 ] and temperature manipulation experiments. Across all combined elevated [ CO2 ] and warming experiments, biomass production and soil respiration were typically enhanced. Responses to the combined treatment were more similar to those in the [ CO2 ]-only treatment than to those in the warming-only treatment. In contrast to warming-only experiments, both the combined and the [ CO2 ]-only treatments elicited larger stimulation of fine root biomass than of aboveground biomass, consistently stimulated soil respiration, and decreased foliar nitrogen (N) concentration. Nonetheless, mineral N availability declined less in the combined treatment than in the [ CO2 ]-only treatment, possibly due to the warming-induced acceleration of decomposition, implying that progressive nitrogen limitation (PNL) may not occur as commonly as anticipated from single factor [ CO2 ] treatment studies. Responses of total plant biomass, especially of aboveground biomass, revealed antagonistic interactions between elevated [ CO2 ] and warming, i.e. the response to the combined treatment was usually less-than-additive. This implies that productivity projections might be overestimated when models are parameterized based on single factor responses. Our results highlight the need for more (and especially more long-term) multifactor manipulation experiments. Because single factor CO2 responses often dominated over warming responses in the combined treatments, our results also suggest that projected responses to future global warming in Earth System models should not be parameterized using single factor warming experiments.

TI  - Microtopographic heterogeneity mediates the soil respiration response to grazing in an alpine swamp meadow on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Soil respiration (Rs) is a major component of terrestrial carbon cycling, which varies greatly with spatial heterogeneity or under grazing. There is scant evidence for the interactive effects of microtopography and grazing on Rs, particularly in alpine swamp meadow ecosystems where hummocks and hollows are common micro topographic features. We conducted a grazing exclusion experiment in an alpine swamp meadow on the central Tibetan Plateau. Seasonal variation in Rs and relevant environmental factors were observed between hummocks and hollows in the free grazing plots and grazing exclusion plots. The growing season Rs was significantly higher in the hummocks than that in the hollows. The responses of Rs to grazing varied greatly with microtopographic heterogeneity, with grazing significantly decreasing Rs in the hummocks but greatly increasing Rs in the hollows. The grazing-induced relative changes in aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon were positively correlated with the changes in Rs. Grazing and microtopography caused changes in soil temperature and microbial biomass were the major factors that driving the seasonal variation in Rs. This information stresses the importance of hummock-hollow microtopography in regulating carbon cycling in grazed alpine swamp meadows.

TI  - Selenium enhanced nitrogen accumulation in legumes in soil with rhizobia bacteria
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The loss of nitrogen in soil directly leads to ecological pollution such as water eutrophication. Urgent need to develop green and efficient approaches to increase nitrogen absorption in plants benefits to improve soil nitrogen use efficiency. Selenium is one of the beneficial elements of plants and has been proven to promote efficient nitrogen uptake by plants. However, previous studies focused on the effects of selenium on plant physiological functions while ignoring the regulation of selenium on the soil nitrogen cycle. This study aims to investigate the regulatory effect of selenium on legume rhizosphere microecology and soil nitrogen cycle process, and the key to legume biomass and nitrogen accumulation, soil physicochemical factors, microbiome characteristics and soil nitrogen cycle process. The results showed that selenium application increased the biomass (increased by 7.26% similar to 21.85% compared with CK) and nitrogen accumulation of legumes (increased by 18.29% similar to 54.09% compared with CK). By 16S rRNA sequencing of rhizosphere soil and roots, we found selenium increased nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Rhizobiaceae and Frankia and nitrifying bacteria such as Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Chloroflex in rhizosphere. Moreover, selenium up-regulated soil nitrogen fixation genes (nifH) and nitrification genes (Arch-amoA, nxrA), and down-regulated denitrification genes (narG, nirS). These changes lead to a significant decrease in soil NO3-/NH4+, which was helpful for the uptake and utilization of legumes. When soil inoculated with rhizobia, the nitrogen accumulation in legumes promoted by Se was much higher than soil non-inoculated with rhizobia bacteria. This study explored the feasibility and great potential of selenium to promote nitrogen accumulation in legumes from the perspective of rhizosphere microecology, proposes and proves the approach to reduce the application of large amounts of elements by introducing selenium, which is conducive to reducing the use of nitrogen fertilizer from the source and alleviating nitrogen pollution.

TI  - Virus ecology and 7-year temporal dynamics across a permafrost thaw gradient
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil microorganisms are pivotal in the global carbon cycle, but the viruses that affect them and their impact on ecosystems are less understood. In this study, we explored the diversity, dynamics, and ecology of soil viruses through 379 metagenomes collected annually from 2010 to 2017. These samples spanned the seasonally thawed active layer of a permafrost thaw gradient, which included palsa, bog, and fen habitats. We identified 5051 virus operational taxonomic units (vOTUs), doubling the known viruses for this site. These vOTUs were largely ephemeral within habitats, suggesting a turnover at the vOTU level from year to year. While the diversity varied by thaw stage and depth-related patterns were specific to each habitat, the virus communities did not significantly change over time. The abundance ratios of virus to host at the phylum level did not show consistent trends across the thaw gradient, depth, or time. To assess potential ecosystem impacts, we predicted hosts in silico and found viruses linked to microbial lineages involved in the carbon cycle, such as methanotrophy and methanogenesis. This included the identification of viruses of Candidatus Methanoflorens, a significant global methane contributor. We also detected a variety of potential auxiliary metabolic genes, including 24 carbon-degrading glycoside hydrolases, six of which are uniquely terrestrial. In conclusion, these long-term observations enhance our understanding of soil viruses in the context of climate-relevant processes and provide opportunities to explore their role in terrestrial carbon cycling.
   This study uses a 7-year metagenomic time series to explore virus communities in a permafrost thaw gradient. The findings reveal that these communities remain stable annually, but show variations across different depths and stages of thaw. These variations are examined through both macro-diversity and micro-diversity. Furthermore, the genomic analyses conducted in this study suggest that viruses may impact the carbon cycle in previously unknown ways. They do this by infecting microbes relevant to carbon processing, including the major methanogen Candidatus Methanoflorens, and by encoding enzymes known as carbon-degrading glycoside hydrolases.image

TI  - Atrazine disrupts nitrogen removal performance and greenhouse gas abatement in bioretention systems: Unraveling microbiotas and macrophytes responses
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - The potential impact of stormwater runoff-induced loss of triazine herbicides, like atrazine (ATZ), on soil nitrogen cycling remains poorly understood. Bioretention systems (BRS) represent effective stormwater control measures (SCM) now understood to serve as important ATZ accumulation zones. However, the effects of ATZ exposure on nitrogen removal and greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement within BRS remain unclear. In the present study, bioretention columns were established and exposed to ATZ (0-25 mg kg-1) for 200 days. The results demonstrated that the accumulation of ATZ led to a reduction in total nitrogen removal efficiency (by 7.7-49.3 %) while simultaneously causing an increase in GHG emission fluxes (by 11.2 %-25.1 %). Moreover, ATZ significantly altered microbial activities, including nitrogen metabolism enzymes (hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, nitrate reductase, and nitrite reductase) and the electron transport system (ETSA). Microbial community analysis showed that ATZ reduced the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria (Nitrospira and Nitrosomonas), along with certain denitrifying bacteria (Thauera, Terrimonas, and Dechloromona). Besides, the compromised function of leaves and roots diminished plant nitrogen uptake, and the application of structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed an increased contribution of plants to nitrogen removal. These findings collectively suggest that the widespread presence of triazine herbicides in urban areas could potentially impact the performance of SCMs.

TI  - The effect of long-term application of nitrogen-rich fertilizers on soil resistome: A study of conventional and organic cropping systems
T2  - SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Soil resistomes of conventional and organic systems were similar in terms of ARG biodiversity.Soil resistomes of conventional and organic systems were different regarding individual ARGs.Uncultivated bacteria and archaea can contribute significantly to soil resistome.Metagenomic studies of various soil environments have previously revealed the widespread distribution of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) around the globe. In this study, we applied shotgun metagenomics to investigate differences in microbial communities and resistomes in Chernozem soils that have been under long-term organic and conventional cropping practices. The organic cropping system was seeded with Triticum spelta without any fertilizer. The conventional cropping system was seeded with Triticum durum Desf and used mineral fertilizer (NPK), that resulted in an increased amount of total and available carbon and nitrogen in soils. Across all samples, we identified a total of 21 ARG classes, among which the dominant were vancomycin, tetracycline and multidrug. Profiling of soil microbial communities revealed differences between the studied fields in the relative abundances of 14 and 53 genera in topsoil and subsoil, respectively. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations (positive and negative) among 18 genera and 6 ARGs, as well as between these ARGs and some chemical properties of soils. The analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that Nitrospirota, Thermoproteota, Actinobacteriota and Binatota phyla of archaea and bacteria serve as hosts for glycopeptide and fluoroquinolone/tetracycline ARGs. Collectively, the data obtained enrich knowledge about the consequences of human agricultural activities in terms of soil microbiome modification and highlight the role of nitrogen cycling taxa, including uncultivated genera, in the formation of soil resistome.

TI  - The replacement of maize (Zea mays L.) by cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.) as biogas substrate and its implications for the energy and material flows of a large biogas plant
T2  - BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR
AB  - Excessive cultivation of maize (Zea mays L.) as a biogas substrate has fired debate about potential land-use change effects of bioenergy cropping systems. Cup plant ( Silphium perfoliatum L.) is a perennial biogas crop that provides more environmental services than maize. This study investigated (i) how to replace maize with cup plant as a biogas substrate in a large-scale biogas plant located in southwest Germany, and (ii) how to optimize the energy and material cycles of such a biogas plant given the new feedstock. The biogas plant produces 1000 m(3) biogas per hour with plans for it to be combined with a large dairy farm (1000 dairy units). It was found that the substitution of maize with cup plant as a biogas substrate results in a methane yield reduction of 10% to 20% due to lower biomass yields. However, there exists a strong potential to increase both biomass yields and biogas substrate quality of cup plant by optimizing establishment procedures and better genotypes. Furthermore, cup plant provides food and shelter for open land animals, including birds and insects, and could hence be a suitable alternative to maize for large biogas plants, being more environmentally beneficial. Extracting proteins from cup-plant biomass could also help replace soy with locally produced protein for feeding cattle. Hydrothermal carbonization is a promising tool for closing nutrient cycles and for extracting phosphate from digestate, but more research is needed before it can be put into practice.

TI  - Genome-Resolved Metagenomics Reveals Distinct Phosphorus Acquisition Strategies between Soil Microbiomes
T2  - MSYSTEMS
AB  - Enhancing soil phosphate solubilization is a promising strategy for agricultural sustainability, while little is known about the mechanisms of how microorganisms cope with differing phosphorus availability. Using a combination of genome-resolved metagenomics and amplicon sequencing, we investigated the microbial mechanisms involved in phosphorus cycling under three agricultural treatments in a wheat-maize rotation system and two natural reforestation treatments. Available soil phosphorus was the key factor shaping bacterial and fungal community composition and function across our agricultural and reforestation sites. Membrane-bound quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase (PQQGDH) and exopolyphosphatases (PPX) governed microbial phosphate solubilization in agroecosystems. In contrast, genes encoding glycerol-3-phosphate transporters (ugpB, ugpC, and ugpQ) displayed a significantly greater abundance in the reforestation soils. The gcd gene encoding PQQGDH was found to be the best determinant for bioavailable soil phosphorus. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) affiliated with Cyclobacteriaceae and Vicinamibacterales were obtained from agricultural soils. Their MAGs harbored not only gcd but also the pit gene encoding low-affinity phos-phate transporters. MAGs obtained from reforestation soils were affiliated with Microtrichales and Burkholderiales. These contain ugp genes but no gcd, and thereby are indicative of a phosphate transporter strategy. Our study demonstrates that knowledge of distinct microbial phosphorus acquisition strategies between agricultural and reforestation soils could help in linking microbial processes with phosphorus cycling.
   IMPORTANCE The soil microbiome is the key player regulating phosphorus cycling proc-esses. Identifying phosphate-solubilizing bacteria and utilizing them for release of recal-citrant phosphate that is bound to rocks or minerals have implications for improving crop nutrient acquisition and crop productivity. In this study, we combined functional metagenomics and amplicon sequencing to analyze microbial phosphorus cycling proc-esses in natural reforestation and agricultural soils. We found that the phosphorus ac-quisition strategies significantly differed between these two ecosystems. A microbial phosphorus solubilization strategy dominated in the agricultural soils, while a microbial phosphate transporter strategy was observed in the reforestation soils. We further iden-tified microbial taxa that contributed to enhanced phosphate solubilization in the agro-ecosystem. These microbes are predicted to be beneficial for the increase in phosphate bioavailability through agricultural practices.

TI  - Differences in the home-field effects of litter decomposition modulate changes in soil microbial nutrient limitations: insights from eco-enzyme stoichiometry
T2  - CATENA
AB  - While the home-field advantage (HFA) effect explains variability in leaf litter decomposition, which is critical for soil enzyme activity and nutrient cycling, its existence and ties to nutrient limitations are still debated. In a 439-day field experiment, we compared decomposition effects of coniferous (Pinus tabuliformis, PT) and broadleaf (Quercus acutissima, QC) litters. The results showed that PT litter (high C/N ratio) exhibited a home-field disadvantage (HFD), with away soil (PT1) having 39.64 % higher total organic carbon (TOC) and 24.25 % higher total nitrogen (TN) than home soil by late decomposition. In contrast, QC litter (low C/N ratio) displayed a clear HFA, significantly increasing TOC, TN, total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in home-site soil. During decomposition, activities of enzymes associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling, including (3-glucosidase (BG), (3-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), and L-leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), increased considerably in QC soil, reaching approximately 2.49, 4.65, and 1.57 times the levels observed in the control soil, respectively. Litter input induced a significant shift in soil nutrient limitations, transitioning from initial phosphorus to nitrogen limitation during decomposition. The study demonstrated that litter input significantly influenced the direction and intensity of microbial nutrient limitation by increasing soil temperature (T) and soil water content (SWC), consequently regulating nutrient availability and nutrient stoichiometric ratios. In the PT site, litter mass loss positively promoted the release of available nutrients, intensifying microbial carbon limitation. In contrast, at the QC site, litter mass loss negatively affected total nutrient pools, and nutrient stoichiometric ratios negatively influenced both microbial carbon and nitrogen/phosphorus limitations. Furthermore, SWC, T, available nutrients (NO3--N, NH4+-N, AP), and total nutrients (TOC, TN, TP) were identified as the key factors driving variations in microbial nutrient limitations. These findings underpin HFA research in litter decomposition and soil nutrient cycling, offering new insights into forest carbon cycling in temperate semiarid forests.

TI  - rDNA- and rRNA-derived communities present divergent assemblage patterns and functional traits throughout full-scale landfill leachate treatment process trains
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Understanding the influences of microbial interactions and niche heterogeneities on microbial communities and functional traits is critical for determining its engineering and ecological significance. However, little is known about microbial community assemblage and functional gene expression throughout full-scale landfill leachate treatment plants. Here, we applied a combination of 16S rRNA and rDNA amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenomic, and qPCR approaches to unveil the ecological associations between distinct communities, functional gene expression and nitrogen cycling processes. By comparing the rDNA and rRNA-derived communities, the rRNA/rDNA ratios suggested that 57.2% of rare taxa were active, and their abundance decreased as increasing of potential activities. In particular, rDNA- and rRNA-based communities exhibited divergent assemblage patterns, and stronger intra-associations among core taxa in the rRNA-based communities than in rDNA-based communities. Furthermore, results regarding both bacterial assemblage and functional traits indicated that the habitat filtering and niche differentiation (treatment units) exerted selection on microbial communities based on functional traits, particular for key ecological functions related to nitrogen cycling. Collectively, our findings provide insights into structure-function associations at the local level and shed light on ecological rules guiding rDNA- and rRNA-based community assembly in landfill leachate treatment systems.

TI  - Forest fire induces short-term shifts in soil food webs with consequences for carbon cycling
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - We tested for fire-induced (5-6 years post-fire) changes in the structure and functioning of the soil food web along a 3000-km north-south transect across European Russia, spanning all major forest types in the northern hemisphere outside the tropics. The total biomass of the detrital food web, including microbes and invertebrates, was not affected by fire. However, fire reduced the biomass of microfauna and mites, but had no impact on mesofauna or macrofauna. Fire also reduced rates of carbon (C) mobilisation by soil biota. Our results demonstrate that fire-induced shifts in soil food webs have significant short-term effects on forest soil C cycling, but that these effects vary across forest types and geographic locations.

TI  - Moso Bamboo Invasion Reshapes Community Structure of Denitrifying Bacteria in Rhizosphere of Alsophila spinulosa
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - The uncontrolled invasion of moso bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens) dramatically alters soil nitrogen cycling and destroys the natural habitat of Alsophila spinulosa. Nevertheless, no clear evidence points out the role of denitrifying bacteria in the invasion of bamboo into the habitat of A. spinulosa. In the present study, we found that low (importance value 0.0008), moderate (0.6551), and high (0.9326) bamboo invasions dramatically altered the underground root biomass of both P. pubescens and A. spinulosa. The root biomass of A. spinulosa was maximal at moderate invasion, indicating that intermediate disturbance might contribute to the growth and survival of the colonized plant. Successful bamboo invasion significantly increased rhizospheric soil available nitrogen content of A. spinulosa, coupled with elevated denitrifying bacterial abundance and diversity. Shewanella, Chitinophaga, and Achromobacter were the primary genera in the three invasions, whereas high bamboo invasion harbored more denitrifying bacteria and higher abundance than moderate and low invasions. Further correlation analysis found that most soil denitrifying bacteria were positively correlated with soil organic matter and available nitrogen but negatively correlated with pH and water content. In addition, our findings illustrated that two denitrifying bacteria, Chitinophaga and Sorangium, might be essential indicators for evaluating the effects of bamboo invasion on the growth of A. spinulosa. Collectively, this study found that moso bamboo invasion could change the nitrogen cycling of colonized habitats through alterations of denitrifying bacteria and provided valuable perspectives for profound recognizing the invasive impacts and mechanisms of bamboo expansion.

TI  - Long-term mulched drip irrigation enhances cotton yield by improving soil quality, microbial community structure, and N conversion
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
AB  - Long-term mulched drip irrigation can improve cotton yield, but its effectiveness depends on how long the land has been cultivated, and the mechanisms behind this relationship are not yet fully understood. In this study, the uncultivated wasteland was used as a control to systematically assess how varying lengths of cotton cultivation influence soil physicochemical properties, microbial community dynamics, and nitrogen (N) transformation pathways. The results revealed that: (1) converting wasteland into cotton fields significantly improved soil quality, with survival rate and yield increasing by 10.04 % and 13.60 %, respectively, in fields cultivated for 22 years compared to those cultivated for 8 years; (2) long-term cultivation markedly enhanced microbial diversity and the relative abundance of beneficial taxa associated with crop growth; (3) genes related to fungal glutamate synthesis and ammonification, as well as bacterial nitrogen fixation and nitrification, were significantly upregulated, while those involved in bacterial glutamate synthesis, nitrite reduction, denitrification, and ammonification were downregulated; (4) core microbial taxa exhibited significant positive correlations with nitrogen cycle-related functional genes; (5) fungal diversity showed a strong positive correlation with cotton yield, whereas bacterial diversity did not. In summary, long-term cultivation can regulate microbial community structure by improving soil quality, thereby enhancing cotton yield by promoting fungal-driven nitrogen cycling and suppressing bacterial denitrification.

TI  - Simulation of the effects of microplastics on the microbial community structure and nitrogen cycle of paddy soil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous in farmland soils. However, few studies have evaluated their effects on the microbial community structure and nitrogen cycle of farmland soils. Here, 0.3% and 1% (mass percentage) of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polylactic acid (PLA) MPs were added to paddy soil to evaluate their impact on the paddy soil microenvironment. The alpha index of the PLA MP treatment was significantly different from that of the control group (p-value < 0.05). In contrast, the indices of the PET and PVC MP treatments were not different from the control (p-value > 0.05). Among the MP treatments, the alpha index of the PLA MP group was significantly different from the PET and PVC MP groups (p-value < 0.05). PCoA analysis also indicated that there were differences between PLA and other MP groups, and different MP concentrations and exposure times had a great impact on microbial composition. The three MPs affected NH4+ metabolism by changing the abundance of a NH2OH-forming gene (amoA) and an organic nitrogen-forming gene (gdh), as well as the abundances of Thiobacillus, Bradyrhizobium, Anaeromyxobacter, Geobacter, and Desulfobacca. Further, the MPs affected NO3- metabolism by regulating the abundance of the nirS and nirK genes and the abundance of Nitrospirae. In contrast, NO2- metabolism was not significantly affected by the MPs due to the low concentration of NO2-, which was attributed to the high abundance of nirS and nirK in the sample. Taken together, our findings indicated that MP addition may have an inhibitory effect on the nitrogen cycle in paddy soils and that the effect of degradable MPs may be greater than that of their non-degradable counterparts. Given the increasing severity of worldwide MP contamination, additional studies are required to assess their impact on global ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Soil pore structure may affect microbial communities involved in carbon cycling during thaw slumps development
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The prevalence of thaw slumps in permafrost regions has significant influence on soil microbial communities and carbon decomposition, which may be related to the changes in soil pore structure. However, how thaw slumps affect soil microbial communities and its relationship with changes in soil pore structure need further study. In this study, high-throughput sequencing and computed tomography scanning were utilized to analyse the soil microbial communities and pore structure during the development of thaw slumps. The results showed that the changes in the soil pore structure and microbial communities were greater in the subsided area than other area of thaw slumps. The diversity (Shannon index) of soil microbial communities and microbial functions involved in carbon cycling in the 0-10 cm soil increased by 1.41 %-5.09 % and 4.20 %-13.68 % after the development of thaw slumps. The changes in soil microbial communities were related to the soil pore structure during the development of thaw slumps. The pore equivalent diameter decreased by 1.36 %-24.66 % after the development of thaw slumps. The operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and Shannon index of microbial communities exhibited significant negative correlations with the pore equivalent diameter, indicating a negative relationship between microbial diversity and pore size. The microbial functions involved in carbon cycling were also negatively correlated with pore size. In addition, thaw slump enhanced the loss and decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC), which decreased by 51.50 % (0-10 cm) and 75.62 % (10-20 cm) in the subsided area. Our results highlight that thaw slumps can enhance the microbial diversity and function by regulating soil pore structure, and can exacerbate the carbon decomposition and positive feedback effects of climate warming. These findings provide new perspectives on the dynamics of carbon cycles under global warming.

TI  - Assessment of bacterial community composition, methanotrophic and nitrogen-cycling bacteria in three soils with different biochar application rates
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - The increased use of biochar as a soil amendment to alleviate the impact of agricultural practices on climate change has been a motivation for many studies to determine the effects of biochar on soil properties, particularly the abundance and activities of soil microbes and related biological processes. This study investigates the impact of different application rates of wood-derived biochar on community structure, nitrogen-cycling and methanotrophic bacteria in three soil types.
   Biochar was added at 0, 2.5, 5 and 10% w/w to black clay loam (BCL, Vertosol), red loam (RL, Dermosol) and brown sandy loam (BSL, Kurosol) soils. Soil chemical analysis and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using the IIlumina Mi-Seq platform were conducted on initial samples and after 10-month incubation.
   The results indicated that the addition of biochar loading levels to the different soils had a significant impact on NH4 and NO3, total C and N, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and soil moisture content. These changes were reflected in significant differences in the bacterial diversity between biochar treatments in the BSL and RL soils, while the BCL soil was more resilient to change. Complete ammonia-oxidising (Nitrospira) and nitrite-oxidising bacteria (NOB) were more abundant than standard ammonia-oxidising bacteria (AOB) in all soils. Increased biochar loading raised the abundance of nitrifying bacteria in BCL soil while Nitrospira became more abundant in BSL soil. Biochar addition affected the abundance of certain N-2 fixer groups in a soil-dependent manner. Strong positive correlations were observed in Rhizobium (r = 0.99) and Azospirillum abundance (r = 0.70) with increased biochar loading rates in BCL. Greater biochar loading also significantly increased the relative abundance of methanotrophs, especially in BCL soil.
   The impact of biochar on community structure and nitrogen-cycling bacteria depended on soil types and biochar rates which correlated to the differences in soil properties. Overall, the abundance of nitrogen-cycling bacterial groups seemed to be most affected by the changes in soil conditions, including aeration, C/N ratio, nutrients and pH in relation to biochar application in different soils. These changes show that short-term biochar loading influences community structure and leads to increases in populations of methanotrophic and nitrifying bacteria.

TI  - Methane and Nitrous Oxide Production From Agricultural Peat Soils in Relation to Drainage Level and Abiotic and Biotic Factors
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from drained agricultural peatlands contribute significantly to global warming. In a laboratory study using intact cores of peat soil from eight different sites in Sweden, factors controlling the emission of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) were examined. Soil properties, and the abundance of the total microbial community (16S rRNA gene abundance), and genes encoding for functions controlling N2O emissions (bacterial and archaeal amoA, nirS, nirK, nosZI, and nosZII) were analyzed and compared against measured greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions were measured at different drainage levels, i.e., higher soil water suction values, since drainage is an important factor controlling greenhouse gas emissions from peat soils. The results showed that N2O and CH4 emissions were generally low, except for N2O emissions at near water-saturated conditions, for which three soils displayed high values and large variations in fluxes. Relationships between N2O emissions and soil properties were mainly linked to soil pH, with higher emissions at lower pH. However, specific assemblages of nitrogen cycling guilds that included nosZII, typically present in non-denitrifying N2O reducers, were detected in soils with low N2O emissions. Overall, these results indicate that both pH and biotic controls determine net N2O fluxes.

TI  - CuO Nanoparticles Alter the Rhizospheric Bacterial Community and Local Nitrogen Cycling for Wheat Grown in a Calcareous Soil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The application of nanoparticles (NPs) to soils, as either fertilizers or fungicides (e.g., CuO NPs), has been proposed to improve the sustainability of agriculture. The observed effects could result directly from the NP-plant interactions or indirectly through effects on the soil microbiome. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of CuO NPs on the changes in the bacterial community structure and nitrogen-cycling-associated functions in a high pH soil and to correlate these changes with nitrate accumulation, soil parameter changes, and plant growth over 28 days. Triticum aestivum seedlings were exposed to 50 mg/kg CuO NPs, 50 mg/kg CuSO4, or 0.5 mg/kg CuSO4 in a standard soil (Lufa 2.1 soil, pH adjusted to 7.6). While Cu treatments reduced nitrate accumulation in the bulk soil, the effects were opposite in the rhizosphere (the soil influenced by root exudates). While nitrate accumulation in bulk soil negatively correlated with total Cu concentration, part of the nitrate concentration in the rhizosphere was explained by root uptake during plant growth, the rest being modulated by Cu treatments. The abundance of genes involved in the nitrogen cycle in the rhizosphere soil correlated with the ionic copper concentration. The increased nitrate concentration in the rhizosphere correlated with an increase of the gene abundance related to the nitrogen fixation and a decrease of denitrification gene abundance. Microbial diversity in bulk or rhizosphere soil under the different treatments alone could not explain these variations, while differences in the assemblages of bacteria associated with these functional gene abundances gave good insights. This study highlights the complexity of microbial N-related function in the rhizosphere and the need to characterize the rhizosphere soil, plant growth and root activity, NP (bio)transformations, along with microbial networks, to understand the impact of agrochemicals (here CuO NPs) on soil fertility.

TI  - Restoration using Azolla imbricata increases nitrogen functional bacterial groups and genes in soil
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Microbial groups are major factors that influence soil function. Currently, there is a lack of studies on microbial functional groups. Although soil microorganisms play an important role in the nitrogen cycle, systematic studies of the effects of environmental factors on microbial populations in relation to key metabolic processes in the nitrogen cycle are seldom reported. In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of the changes in nitrogen functional groups in mandarin orange garden soil treated with Azolla imbricata. The structures of the major functional bacterial groups and the functional gene abundances involved in key processes of the soil nitrogen cycle were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and quantitative real-time PCR, respectively. The results indicated that returning A. imbricata had an important influence on the composition of soil nitrogen functional bacterial communities. Treatment with A. imbricata increased the diversity of the nitrogen functional bacteria. The abundances of nitrogen functional genes were significantly higher in the treated soil compared with the control soil. Both the diversity of the major nitrogen functional bacteria (nifH bacteria, nirK bacteria, and narG bacteria) and the abundances of nitrogen functional genes in the soil showed significant positive correlations with the soil pH, the organic carbon content, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and NH4 (+)-N and NO3 (-)-N contents. Treatment with 12.5 kg fresh A. imbricata per mandarin orange tree was effective to improve the quality of the mandarin orange garden soil. This study analyzed the mechanism of the changes in functional bacterial groups and genes involved in key metabolic processes of the nitrogen cycle in soil treated by A. imbricata.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability in the deposition of beach-cast kelp (wrack) and inter-specific differences in degradation rates
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - Coastal habitats dominated by marine macroalgae typically exhibit high rates of primary productivity and play a key role in local and regional carbon cycles and stores. In temperate regions, large brown algae (i.e. kelps and fucoids) contribute significantly to macroalgal primary production, most of which is exported from source habitats as detritus. The ultimate fate of this detritus and the processes controlling detrital pathways into food webs and carbon cycles remain poorly understood. Based on field surveys, we quantified the biomass of kelp-derived detritus (wrack) at sandy and pebble-dominated shores in Ireland and conducted a manipulative field experiment to test for inter-specific differences in detritus degradation rates and the effect of macroinvertebrate detritivores. Overall, accumulated wrack biomass was similar on all shores but varied temporally depending on habitat type. Degradation rates and the nutritional (C:N) and chemical (polyphenol concentrations) properties differed among kelp species. Interestingly, exclusion of macroinvertebrate detritivores did not affect kelp degradation rates, C:N ratios or polyphenol content. Our findings show that rates of macroalgal breakdown differ among kelp species and that, in contrast to other aquatic systems, macroinvertebrates appear to play a very limited role in the breakdown of these marine detrital subsidies, suggesting a key role for meiofauna and microbes in detritus processing. Increasing recognition for the role of detritus in coastal food webs and carbon cycles warrants a better understanding of the mechanisms underpinning degradation rates.

TI  - Enhancing Soil Phosphorus Availability in Intercropping Systems: Roles of Plant Growth Regulators
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - Plant growth regulators (PGRs) enhance crop stress resistance but their roles in microbial-mediated phosphorus cycling within intercropping systems are unclear. Thus, We conducted a two-year field study using corn (Zea mays L. cv. Denghai 605) and soybean (Glycine max L. cv. Hedou 22) in fluvisols and luvisols soil according to World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) standard. Under a 4-row corn and 6-row soybean strip intercropping system, three treatments were applied: a water control (CK), and two plant growth regulators-T1 (EC: ethephon [300 mg/L] + cycocel [2 g/L]) and T2 (ED: ethephon [300 mg/L] + 2-Diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate [10 mg/L]). Foliar applications were administered at the V7 stage (seventh leaf) of intercropped corn plants to assess how foliar-applied PGRs (T1/T2) modulated the soil phosphorus availability, microbial communities, and functional genes in maize intercropping systems. PGRs increased the soil organic phosphorus and available phosphorus contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity, but not total phosphorus. PGRs declined the alpha-diversity in fluvisols soil but increased the alpha-diversity in luvisols soil. The major taxa changed from Actinobacteria (CK) to Proteobacteria (T1) and Saccharibacteria (T2) in fluvisols soil, and from Actinobacteria/Gemmatimonadetes (CK) to Saccharibacteria (T1) and Acidobacteria (T2) in luvisols soil. Functional gene dynamics indicated soil-specific regulation, where fluvisols soil harbored more phoD (organic phosphorus mineralization) and relA (polyphosphate degradation) genes, whereas phnP gene dominated in luvisols soil. T1 stimulated organic phosphorus mineralization and inorganic phosphorus solubilization in fluvisols soil, upregulating regulation genes, and T2 enhanced polyphosphate synthesis and transport gene expression in luvisols soil. Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, and Chloroflexi were positively correlated with organic phosphorus mineralization and polyphosphate cycling genes, whereas Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia correlated with available potassium (AP), total phosphorus (TP), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Thus, PGRs activated soil phosphorus by restructuring soil type-dependent microbial functional networks, connecting PGRs-induced shifts with microbial phosphorus cycling mechanisms. These findings facilitate the targeted use of PGRs to optimize microbial-driven phosphorus efficiency in strategies for sustainable phosphorus management in diverse agricultural soils.

TI  - Independent and Interactive Effects of Precipitation Intensity and Duration on Soil Microbial Communities in Forest and Grassland Ecosystems of China: A Meta-Analysis
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Altered precipitation regimes, both in intensity and duration, can profoundly influence the structure and function of soil microbial communities, yet the patterns and drivers of these responses remain unclear across ecosystem types. Here, using data exclusively from 101 field experiments conducted in China (yielding 695 observations), we investigated the impacts of altered precipitation on soil microbial biomass, diversity, and enzymatic activity in forest and grassland ecosystems. Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) increased in response to precipitation addition, particularly in grasslands, but they decreased under reduced precipitation, with the decline being more pronounced in forests. The magnitude and duration of precipitation manipulation significantly influenced these effects, with moderate and long-term changes producing divergent responses. Bacterial diversity was largely unaffected by all precipitation treatments, whereas fungal diversity decreased significantly under intense and short-term reductions in precipitation. Enzyme activities exhibited the following element-specific patterns: carbon- and phosphorus-cycling enzymes and antioxidant enzymes were suppressed by precipitation reduction, especially in grasslands, while nitrogen-cycling enzymes showed no consistent response. Moreover, microbial responses were significantly shaped by environmental factors, including mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and elevation. Our region-specific analysis highlights precipitation-driven microbial dynamics across China's diverse climatic and ecological conditions. These findings demonstrate that soil microbial communities respond asymmetrically to precipitation changes, with responses shaped by both ecosystem type and climatic context, underscoring the need to account for environmental heterogeneity when predicting belowground feedback to climate change.

TI  - The Effect of Different Biochar Characteristics on Soil Nitrogen Transformation Processes: A Review
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - For the last 30 years, interest has focused on biochar and its potential to store carbon in soil to mitigate climate change whilst improving soil properties for increased crop production and, therefore, could play a critical role in both agricultural sustainability and broader environmental aims. Biochar, a carbonaceous product, is formed from organic feedstock pyrolysised in the absence of air and, therefore, is a potential means of recycling organic waste. However, different feedstock and pyrolysis conditions result in a biochar with a range of altered characteristics. These characteristics influence nitrogen transformation processes in soil and result in the metabolism of different substrates and the formation of different products, which have different effects on agricultural yield. This paper reviews how the production of biochar, from varying feedstock and pyrolysis conditions, results in different biochar characteristics that influence each stage of the nitrogen cycle, namely processes involved in fixation, assimilation, mineralisation and denitrification. The nitrogen cycle is briefly outlined, providing a structure for the following discussion on influential biochar characteristics including carbon composition (whether recalcitrant or rapidly metabolisable), mineral composition, surface area, porosity, cation exchange capacity, inhibitory substances and pH and so on. Hence, after the addition of biochar to soil, microbial biomass and diversity, soil porosity, bulk density, water-holding capacity, cation exchange capacity, pH and other parameters change, but that change is subject to the type and amount of biochar. Hence, products from soil-based nitrogen transformation processes, which may be beneficial for plant growth, are highly dependent on biochar characteristics. The paper concludes with a diagrammatic summation of the influence of biochar on each phase of the nitrogen cycle, which, it is hoped, will serve as a reference for both students and biochar practitioners.

TI  - Dynamics of soil microbial communities involved in carbon cycling along three successional forests in southern China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Dynamics of plant communities during forest succession have been received great attention in the past decades, yet information about soil microbial communities that are involved in carbon cycling remains limited. Here we investigated soil microbial community composition and carbohydrate degradation potential using metagenomic analysis and examined their influencing factors in three successional subtropical forests in southern China. Results showed that the abundances of soil bacteria and fungi increased (p <= 0.05 for both) with forest succession in relation to both soil and litter characteristics, whereas the bacterial diversity did not change (p > 0.05) and the fungal diversity of Shannon-Wiener index even decreased (p <= 0.05). The abundances of microbial carbohydrate degradation functional genes of cellulase, hemicellulase, and pectinase also increased with forest succession (p <= 0.05 for all). However, the chitinase gene abundance did not change with forest succession (p > 0.05) and the amylase gene abundance decreased firstly in middle-succession forest and then increased in late-succession forest. Further analysis indicated that changes of functional gene abundance in cellulase, hemicellulase, and pectinase were primarily affected by soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen, and soil moisture, whereas the variation of amylase gene abundance was well explained by soil phosphorus and litterfall. Overall, we created a metagenome profile of soil microbes in subtropical forest succession and fostered our understanding of microbially-mediated soil carbon cycling.

TI  - Termites amplify the effects of wood traits on decomposition rates among multiple bamboo and dicot woody species
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Wood decomposition is a key process in the terrestrial carbon cycle, controlling carbon storage with feedback to climate. In (sub) tropical forest, termites are major players in wood decomposition, but their role relative to that of microbial decomposers and wood traits of different tree species is poorly understood. The current literature also has strong bias towards dicot tree decomposition, while abundant woody monocots, particularly bamboos, also contribute greatly to (sub) tropical carbon cycling. Here, we present the first experiment to disentangle effects of dead wood traits and termite activity on decomposition of 66 angiosperm species of wide-ranging phylogenetic position: 31 bamboos, eight non-bamboo Poaceae, 18 eudicots and nine magnoliids. We incubated dead stems of up to 4 size classes per species in a common garden' in tropical S China. We tested the hypotheses that (i) dead wood of bamboo (monocots) is less decomposable than dead wood of eudicots or magnoliids; (ii) both microbial- and termite-driven decomposition show negative relationships with initial wood density and with dry matter content. Bamboo wood generally decomposed more slowly than dicot wood but only slightly slower at given wood density or diameter. Wood decomposition in both bamboo and dicot clades decreased with wood density or dry matter content. Termites contributed greatly to this pattern, explaining 53.4% of the variance in wood decomposition and preferentially attacking dead wood of lower initial density, which corresponded with thicker outer culm walls in the case of bamboo species. Thus, termites strongly strengthen the relationship between species' wood traits and litter decomposition as driven by microbial activity.Synthesis. These previously unknown relationships among dead wood quality, diameter, termites and decomposing microbes of both woody monocots and dicots will advance our understanding of the driving mechanisms of (sub) tropical wood decomposition and its contribution to the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Effects of enrofloxacin on soil nitrification and denitrification: A microbiological study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB  - Extensive use of enrofloxacin (ENR) leads to its widespread presence in soil, which seriously threatens the soil ecological environment and biogeochemical cycles. Thus, it is very important to comprehend the fate of ENR and its effect on nitrogen cycling in farmland soil. In this investigation, quantitative real-time PCR and 16 S rRNA genes amplicon sequencing were used to analyze the microbiological mechanism of the effects of ENR on the soil nitrification and denitrification processes of farmland. The results showed that the addition of ENR suppressed the ammoniation process, leading to a decline in NH4+-N content. Additionally, ENR led to a decrease in the soil nitrification potential by decreasing the relative abundance of Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira. However, ENR inhibited the relative abundance of narG , as well as the activity of nitrate reductase, which led to the accumulation of NO3- -N. Furthermore, ENR increased the possibility of nitrous oxide emissions by increasing the relative abundances of Flavobacterium, Bacillus and Aeromonas, as well as those of nirS and nosZ. This study provided data to support for the ecological impact and risk assessment of ENR on nitrogen cycling in farmland soil.

TI  - Long-term climate establishes functional legacies by altering microbial traits
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Long-term climate history can influence rates of soil carbon cycling but the microbial traits underlying these legacy effects are not well understood. Legacies may result if historical climate differences alter the traits of soil microbial communities, particularly those associated with carbon cycling and stress tolerance. However, it is also possible that contemporary conditions can overcome the influence of historical climate, particularly under extreme conditions. Using shotgun metagenomics, we assessed the composition of soil microbial functional genes across a mean annual precipitation gradient that previously showed evidence of strong climate legacies in soil carbon flux and extracellular enzyme activity. Sampling coincided with recovery from a regional, multi-year severe drought, allowing us to document how the strength of climate legacies varied with contemporary conditions. We found increased investment in genes associated with resource cycling with historically higher precipitation across the gradient, particularly in traits related to resource transport and complex carbon degradation. This legacy effect was strongest in seasons with the lowest soil moisture, suggesting that contemporary conditions-particularly, resource stress under water limitation-influences the strength of legacy effects. In contrast, investment in stress tolerance did not vary with historical precipitation, likely due to frequent periodic drought throughout the gradient. Differences in the relative abundance of functional genes explained over half of variation in microbial functional capacity-potential enzyme activity-more so than historical precipitation or current moisture conditions. Together, these results suggest that long-term climate can alter the functional potential of soil microbial communities, leading to legacies in carbon cycling.

TI  - Diversity and Contributions to Nitrogen Cycling and Carbon Fixation of Soil Salinity Shaped Microbial Communitiesin Tarim Basin
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Arid and semi-arid regions comprise nearly one-fifth of the earth's terrestrial surface. However, the diversities and functions of their soil microbial communities are not well understood, despite microbial ecological importance in driving biogeochemical cycling. Here, we analyzed the geochemistry and microbial communities of the desert soils from Tarim Basin, northwestern China. Our geochemical data indicated half of these soils are saline. Metagenomic analysis showed that bacterial phylotypes (89.72% on average) dominated the community, with relatively small proportions of Archaea (7.36%) and Eukaryota (2.21%). Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Euryarchaeota were most abundant based on metagenomic data, whereas genes attributed to Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Euryarchaeota, and Thaumarchaeota most actively transcribed. The most abundant phylotypes (Halobacterium, Halomonas, Burkholderia, Lactococcus, Clavibacter, Cellulomonas, Actinomycetospora, Beutenbergia, Pseudomonas, and Marinobacter) in each soil sample, based on metagenomic data, contributed marginally to the population of all microbial communities, whereas the putative halophiles, which contributed the most abundant transcripts, were in the majority of the active microbial population and is consistent with the soil salinity. Sample correlation analyses according to the detected and active genotypes showed significant differences, indicating high diversity of microbial communities among the Tarim soil samples. Regarding ecological functions based on the metatranscriptomic data, transcription of genes involved in various steps of nitrogen cycling, as well as carbon fixation, were observed in the tested soil samples. Metatranscriptomic data also indicated that Thaumarchaeota are crucial for ammonia oxidation and Proteobacteria play the most important role in other steps of nitrogen cycle. The reductive TCA pathway and dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle attributed to Proteobacteria and Crenarchaeota, respectively, were highly represented in carbon fixation. Our study reveals that the microbial communities could provide carbon and nitrogen nutrients for higher plants in the sandy saline soils of Tarim Basin.

TI  - Responses of soil inhabiting nitrogen-cycling microbial communities to wetland degradation on the Zoige Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
AB  - The wetlands on the Zoige Plateau have experienced serious degradation, with most of the original marsh being converted to marsh meadow or meadow. Based on the 3 wetland degradation stages, we determined the effects of wetland degradation on the structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling (nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying) microbial communities in 3 soil types (intact wetland: marsh soil; early degrading wetland: marsh meadow soil; and degraded wetland: meadow soil) using 454-pyrosequencing. The structure and relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities differed in the 3 soil types. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in most soil samples but the most abundant soil nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying microbial bacteria differed at the class, order, family, and genus levels among the 3 soil types. At the genus level, the majority of nitrogen-fixing bacterium sequences related to Bradyrhizobium were from marsh and marsh meadow soils; whereas those related to Geobacter originated from meadow soil. The majority of ammonia-oxidizing bacterium sequences related to Nitrosospira were from marsh (except for the 40-60 cm layer), marsh meadow and meadow soils; whereas those related to Candidatus Solibacter originated from 40-60 cm layer of marsh soil. The majority of denitrifying bacterium sequences related to Candidatus Solibacter and Anaeromyxobacter were from marsh and meadow soils; whereas those related to Herbaspirillum originated from meadow soil. The distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and species were correlated with soil type based upon Venn and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). Changes in soil type, caused by different water regimes were the most important factors influencing compositional changes in the nitrogen-fixing, ammonia-oxidizing, and denitrifying microbial communities.

TI  - Short-Term Straw Return Combined with Nitrogen Fertilizer Alters the Soil Nitrogen Supply in Rice-Rapeseed Planting Systems
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
AB  - This study aimed to assess the influences of short-term straw return combined with nitrogen (N) fertilizer on crop yield, soil properties, the bacterial community, and soil nitrogen cycling gene abundance in a rice-rapeseed planting system. A two-year field experiment was conducted in a paddy field from 2019 to 2021. There were four treatments in the experiment: -N-S, no N applied with no straw return; -N+S, no N applied with straw return; +N-S, N applied with no straw return; and +N+S, N applied with straw return. The results showed that short-term straw return combined with N fertilizer could increase crop yield and N use efficiency. N fertilizer application had a positive effect on Gemmatimonadota and Desulfobacterota abundance. Straw returning had a positive effect on Desulfobacterota and Proteobacteria abundance. N fertilization significantly increased the abundance of amoA-AOA, amoA-AOB, and nxrB in agricultural soils. Straw return and N fertilization were not conducive to denitrification. We conclude that short-term straw return combined with N fertilizer in rice-growing areas not only increase crop yield and improve crop N uptake but also increase SOM, total N, and NH4+ and improve the soil microbial activity and N use efficiency.

TI  - Two Decades of Experimental Manipulations of Heaths and Forest Understory in the Subarctic
T2  - AMBIO
AB  - Current atmospheric warming due to increase of greenhouse gases will have severe consequences for the structure and functioning of arctic ecosystems with changes that, in turn, may feed back on the global-scale composition of the atmosphere. During more than two decades, environmental controls on biological and biogeochemical processes and possible atmospheric feedbacks have been intensely investigated at Abisko, Sweden, by long-term ecosystem manipulations. The research has addressed questions like environmental regulation of plant and microbial community structure and biomass, carbon and nutrient pools and element cycling, including exchange of greenhouse gases and volatile organic compounds, with focus on fundamental processes in the interface between plants, soil and root-associated and free-living soil microorganisms. The ultimate goal has been to infer from these multi-decadal experiments how subarctic and arctic ecosystems will respond to likely environmental changes in the future. Here we give an overview of some of the experiments and main results.

TI  - Oasification Promotes Soil Nitrogen Cycling by Increasing the Abundance of Microbes and Genes Involved in Nitrogen Metabolism
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The oasis is a unique ecosystem in arid regions. Currently, there is a comprehensive understanding gap regarding the community characteristics of the entire nitrogen cycling microorganisms in oasis soil, including species diversity, community structure, and nitrogen functional traits, as well as their influencing factors. To elucidate the influence of oasification on nitrogen metabolism in agricultural soils, this study examines the intricate variations in microbial composition and gene abundances related to nitrogen metabolism in cotton field soils with varying cultivation histories (ranging from native deserts to 30-year-old cotton fields) in the Aral Reclamation Area of Xinjiang, China. The study findings reveal: As oasification intensifies, (1) agricultural practices such as irrigation and fertilization result in increased soil moisture and nutrient levels, with total nitrogen (TN), NH4 +-N, and NO3 --N showing particularly significant increases. (2) The primary nitrogen cycling process shifted from dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA, 29.38%-37.64%) to denitrification (DEN, 31.67%-52.92%), indicating that denitrification becomes the dominant process in oasification. (3) Soil organic carbon (SOC), soil moisture (SWC), and phosphorus content (TP) significantly influence nitrogen metabolism-related functional species and genes. This study sheds light on the complex effects of oasification on microbial nitrogen metabolism processes in farmland, and explores the mechanism of nitrogen metabolism by coupling the changes of functional microbial communities and genes related to nitrogen metabolism.

TI  - Influence of functionalized graphene on the bacterial and fungal diversity of Vicia faba rhizosphere soil
T2  - NEW CARBON MATERIALS
AB  - The effect of functionalized graphene on the growth and development of Vicia faba L. was investigated by analyzing its impact on the composition and diversity of the microbial community in rhizosphere peat soil. Seedlings of V. faba planted in this peat soil were treated with either distilled water (CK) or 25 mg<middle dot>L-1 (G25) of functionalized graphene solution. Results showed that the height and root length of V. faba seedlings in the G25 group were significantly larger than those in CK group. The microbial community was analyzed by amplifying and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region of bacteria and internal transcribed spacer region of fungi in rhizosphere soil using Illumina MiSeq technology. Alpha and beta diversity analysis indicated that functionalized graphene increased the richness and diversity of bacteria and fungi in the V. faba rhizosphere peat soil. The abundances of three nitrogen cycling-related bacteria, Hydrogenophaga, Sphingomonas and Nitrosomonadaceae, were also altered after treatment with the functionalized graphene. The relative abundance of Basilicum, related to soil phosphorus solubilization, decreased in the fungal community, while the relative abundance of Clonostachys and Dimorphospora, which exhibited strong biological control over numerous fungal plant pathogens, nematodes and insects, increased in the soil after functionalized graphene treatment. Redundancy analysis revealed that the potential of hydrogen (pH), organic matter, and total phosphorus contributed the most to the changes in bacterial and fungal community composition in the rhizosphere soil. Overall, our findings suggested that the addition of functionalized graphene altered the relative abundances of nitrogen and phosphorus cycling-related microorganisms in peat soil, promoting changes in the physicochemical properties of the soil and ultimately leading to the improved growth of V. faba plants.

TI  - Microbe-mediated denitrification promotes nitrogen loss in mining soils contaminated with rare earth elements
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The reduction of nitrogen content in soil contaminated with rare earth elements (REEs) should be a concerned ecological issue. Although microbes play important roles in nitrogen cycling, the mechanisms of microbemediated nitrogen cycling remain largely unclear in relation to REE pollution. To determine potential variations in core nitrogen metabolism processes of microbes in REE-contaminated habitats, we sampled polluted soils in China's largest REE mine and unpolluted control soils from the area closed to the REE background value. The abundances of genes and taxa related to nitrogen cycling were assessed using metagenomic and quantitative PCR analyses. Compared to control soils, REE-contaminated soils showed more genetic potential of microbe-mediated denitrification, inhibited assimilation nitrate reduction, minimally altered dissimilation nitrate reduction and nitrification, unchanged nitrogen fixation, and altered abundances of microbial genera, protein-coding genes, and metabolic pathways. Altogether, these findings suggest more potential of nitrogen loss than nitrogen input. Furthermore, heterotrophic denitrifiers were the main denitrifying taxa, especially nirS-type denitrifiers were tolerant to REEs. The increased denitrification likely promoted to nitrogen loss, explaining the observed total nitrogen deficiency in the polluted soils. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the ecological risks caused by REE pollution and the ecological functional changes of REE-contaminated soils.

TI  - Genomic fingerprints of the world's soil ecosystems
T2  - MSYSTEMS
AB  - Despite the explosion of soil metagenomic data, we lack a synthesized understanding of patterns in the distribution and functions of soil microorganisms. These patterns are critical to predictions of soil microbiome responses to climate change and resulting feedbacks that regulate greenhouse gas release from soils. To address this gap, we assay 1,512 manually curated soil metagenomes using complementary annotation databases, read-based taxonomy, and machine learning to extract multidimensional genomic fingerprints of global soil microbiomes. Our objective is to uncover novel biogeographical patterns of soil microbiomes across environmental factors and ecological biomes with high molecular resolution. We reveal shifts in the potential for (i) microbial nutrient acquisition across pH gradients; (ii) stress-, transport-, and redox-based processes across changes in soil bulk density; and (iii) greenhouse gas emissions across biomes. We also use an unsupervised approach to reveal a collection of soils with distinct genomic signatures, characterized by coordinated changes in soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and cation exchange capacity and in bulk density and clay content that may ultimately reflect soil environments with high microbial activity. Genomic fingerprints for these soils highlight the importance of resource scavenging, plant-microbe interactions, fungi, and heterotrophic metabolisms. Across all analyses, we observed phylogenetic coherence in soil microbiomes-more closely related microorganisms tended to move congruently in response to soil factors. Collectively, the genomic fingerprints uncovered here present a basis for global patterns in the microbial mechanisms underlying soil biogeochemistry and help beget tractable microbial reaction networks for incorporation into process-based models of soil carbon and nutrient cycling. IMPORTANCE We address a critical gap in our understanding of soil microorganisms and their functions, which have a profound impact on our environment. We analyzed 1,512 global soils with advanced analytics to create detailed genetic profiles (fingerprints) of soil microbiomes. Our work reveals novel patterns in how microorganisms are distributed across different soil environments. For instance, we discovered shifts in microbial potential to acquire nutrients in relation to soil acidity, as well as changes in stress responses and potential greenhouse gas emissions linked to soil structure. We also identified soils with putative high activity that had unique genomic characteristics surrounding resource acquisition, plant-microbe interactions, and fungal activity. Finally, we observed that closely related microorganisms tend to respond in similar ways to changes in their surroundings. Our work is a significant step toward comprehending the intricate world of soil microorganisms and its role in the global climate.

TI  - Impact of twenty pesticides on soil carbon microbial functions and community composition
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Pesticides are known to affect non-targeted soil microorganisms. Still, studies comparing the effect of multiple pesticides on a wide range of microbial endpoints associated with carbon cycling are scarce. Here, we employed fluorescence enzymatic assay and real-time PCR to evaluate the effect of 20 commercial pesticides, applied at their recommended dose and five times their recommended dose, on soil carbon cycling related enzymatic activities (alpha-1,4-glucosidase, beta-1,4-glucosidase, beta-D-cellobiohydrolase and beta-xylosidase), and on the absolute abundance of functional genes (cbhl and chiA), in three different South Australian agricultural soils. The effects on cellulolytic and chitinolytic microorganisms, and the total microbial community composition were determined using shotgun metagenomic sequencing in selected pesticide-treated and untreated samples. The application of insecticides significantly increased the cbhl and chiA genes absolute abundance in the acidic soil. At the community level, insecticide fipronil had the greatest stimulating effect on cellulolytic and chitinolytic microorganisms, followed by fungicide metalaxyl-M and insecticide imidacloprid. A shift towards a fungal dominated microbial community was observed in metalaxyl-M treated soil. Overall, our results suggest that the application of pesticides might affect the soil carbon cycle and may disrupt the formation of soil organic matter and structure stabilisation.

TI  - Hydrological effects on the diversity of phenolic degrading bacteria in a peatland: implications for carbon cycling
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Northern peatlands store ca. 1/3 of the world's soil organic carbon and this is attributed to low decomposition rates as a result of waterlogged, anaerobic conditions and high levels of phenolic substances. Climate change models predict both an increase in summer droughts and increased rainfall, depending on region, but information on the effect of these changes on the microbial population that mediate phenolic degradation is sparse. Temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGGE) was therefore used to assess the effect of simulated summer drought and increased rainfall on the diversity of phenolic degrading bacteria in a northern peatland using the gene XylE, encoding for the enzyme Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O), as an indicator. Under simulated drought, a greater diversity (129.4%, P < 0.05) and abundance of phenolic catabolising bacterial species was found. Concurrent increased total phenol oxidase activities (83.3%) and beta-glucosidase activities (157.6%, P < 0.01) were found with consistently lower concentrations of phenolic compounds, DOC and increased CO2 fluxes. This increased mineralisation is likely to lower carbon storage capacity and increase climate forcing. Conversely, the increased rainfall simulation suppressed diversity (62.2%, P < 0.05), abundance and phenol oxidase activities (103.3%, P < 0.001), giving increased phenolic compound (424.8%, P < 0.1 only) and DOC concentrations (201.3%, P < 0.001), along with increased anaerobic trace gas fluxes. These hugely increased aquatic carbon concentrations available for export are of serious concern due to their deleterious effect on drinking water quality. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phenylalanine-mediated changes in the soil bacterial community promote nitrogen cycling and plant growth
T2  - MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Soil amino acids (AAs) are the most active components of soil N, which can be mineralized or absorbed by bacteria as N and C sources. We hypothesized that exogenous AAs could regulate the bacterial community and affect soil N cycling, and the effect sizes could vary depending on individual AAs. Here, we applied feather (keratin)-based compost rich in AAs to Poncirus trifoliata (L.) to evaluate the regulation of bacterial community by AAs; furthermore, we applied six individual AAs to test their effects. The compost significantly increased soil hydrolysable AA content, ammonia monooxygenase gene abundance, and plant growth and changed bacterial community structure. Redundancy analysis revealed that the effects of AAs on the bacterial community composition were greater than those of soil chemical properties, and phenylalanine (Phe) was the most effective among thirteen individual AAs. When applied individually, Phe caused the greatest increase in N cycling-related enzyme activity and plant growth and most significantly altered the bacterial community structure among the six exogenous AAs. Notably, Phe significantly increased the relative abundances of Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Para-burkholderia, Azospirillum, Cupriavidus, and Achromobacter, whose abundances were significantly positively correlated with plant biomass, and significantly reduced the relative abundances of Arachidicoccus, Pseudope-dobacter, Sphingobacterium, and Paenibacillus, whose abundances were significantly negatively correlated with plant biomass. We demonstrate that soil AAs strongly shape the bacterial community. Particularly, Phe enhances N cycling and plant growth by increasing the potentially beneficial bacterial taxa and inhibiting the potentially harmful bacterial taxa, which needs further validation.

AB  - Aims Global change is shown to significantly affect the C storage function of peatlands; however, a majority of previous research is focused on a single environmental stressor such as the increased temperature. As a result, little is known about the interactive effect of multiple environmental stressors on peatland C storage, especially in sedge-dominated fen peatlands. Methods We performed a full factorial experiment of increased temperature and elevated atmospheric CO(2)concentration on minerotrophic, sedge-dominated fen monoliths to experimentally examine the individual and interactive effects of simulated future climate conditions on peatland plant biomass, CO(2)exchange, and pore water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over one full growing season. Results Our study demonstrates that warming and elevated atmospheric CO(2)significantly increased aboveground and belowground biomass, respectively, as well as the gross ecosystem production (GEP), while the DOC concentrations and respired CO(2)from peatland soils only increased under warming Conclusions Our results suggest that global change will increase both plant production and microbial decomposition, but with altered plant biomass allocation between aboveground and belowground. Our study provides experimental evidence for shifts in ecosystem-level carbon dynamics under global change for a sedge-dominated peatland, and suggests that while carbon stores may weaken, the carbon sink will be maintained in these types of northern peatlands if hydrological conditions are largely maintained.

TI  - Nutrient limitations induced by drought affect forage N and P differently in two permanent grasslands
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Drought events can strongly affect ecosystem functioning by modifying relationship between plants, microbes and soil chemistry, with consequent impacts on nutrient cycling. However, the potential impacts of a soil moisture reduction on the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling in grasslands remain poorly understood, especially in regard to. forage production.
   To fill this knowledge gap, a drought experiment was carried out using rainout shelters in two permanent grasslands, characterized by similar vegetation communities but contrasted soil nutrient limitations. Drought treatments were applied during two months, either when plant growth was highest (Early-season drought) or after the peak of biomass production (Late-season drought). Dry matter production, forage N status (NNI) and P content as well as N and P contents in microbial biomass and soil were determined.
   Both early and late-season drought significantly reduced soil moisture during the vegetation growth period. Forage yield was also reduced by drought, but only when it occurred late in the season. Using a structural equation model, we showed that soil moisture reduction had a direct effect on forage N status, suggesting that water shortage induced lower transpiration and water fluxes. Soil moisture reduction also affected forage P by reducing the availability of soil P. However, other mechanisms played a larger role and were site-specific. At the more fertile site, reduction in soil moisture directly impaired forage P, suggesting that water stress mainly resulted in lower diffusion rates to roots, while at the less fertile site, an indirect reduction of forage P through a pathway implying microbes (decrease in microbial P) was detected.
   Our results suggest that the two grasslands suffered mainly from water shortage per se, but also from drought induced nutrient deficiency (mainly P), which amplified yield losses and further decreased forage quality. Overall, our findings emphasize the need for further research on the plant-soil-microbe system functioning, in order to secure a sustainable and resilient forage production in the context of climate change.

TI  - Brownification of freshwater promotes nitrogen-cycling microorganism growth following terrestrial material increase and ultraviolet radiation reduction
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Brownification is an increasingly concerning phenomenon faced by aquatic ecosystems in the changing environments, and the microbiome plays an irreplaceable role in material circulation and food web construction. Insight into the in-fluence of brownification on microbial communities is crucial from an ecological standpoint. In this study, we simu-lated brownification using a the mesocosm system and explored the relationship between the characteristics of microbial communities and brownification using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and ul-traviolet (UV) spectroscopy combined with high-throughput amplicon sequencing techniques. The results showed that brownification reduced the richness of the microbial community and selectively promoted the growth of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms, including hgcI_clade, Microbacteriaceae, and Limnohabitans. Brownification affected microbial communities by altering the carbon source composition and underwater spectrum intensity; UV, blue, violet, and cyan light were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with microbial community richness, and random forest analysis revealed that UV, C1 (microbial humic-like), and C3 (terrestrial humic-like) were the major factors significantly influencing microbiome variation. We found that brownification affected microorganisms in shallow lakes, especially nitrogen cycling microorganisms, and propose that controlling terrestrial material export is an effective strategy for managing freshwater brownification.

TI  - Global climate changes and the soil cover
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
CP  - 5th Congress of the Dokuchaev-Soil-Science-Society
AB  - The relationships between climate changes and the soil cover are analyzed. The greenhouse effect induced by the rising concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O, and many other trace gases in the air has been one of the main factors of the global climate warming in the past 30-40 years. The response of soils to climate changes is considered by the example of factual data on soil evolution in the dry steppe zone of Russia. Probable changes in the carbon cycle under the impact of rising CO2 concentrations are discussed. It is argued that this rise may have an effect of an atmospheric fertilizer and lead to a higher productivity of vegetation, additional input of organic residues into the soils, and activation of soil microflora. Soil temperature and water regimes, composition of soil gases, soil biotic parameters, and other dynamic soil characteristics are most sensitive to climate changes. For the territory of Russia, in which permafrost occupies more than 50% of the territory, the response of this highly sensitive natural phenomenon to climate changes is particularly important. Long-term data on soil temperatures at a depth of 40 cm are analyzed for four large regions of Russia. In all of them, except for the eastern sector of Russian Arctic, a stable trend toward the rise in the mean annual soil temperature. In the eastern sector (the Verkhoyansk weather station), the soil temperature remains stable.

TI  - Response Characteristics and Community Assembly Mechanisms of nirS-Type Denitrifiers in the Alpine Wetland under Simulated Precipitation Conditions
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Simple Summary The nitrogen cycling process in alpine wetlands is profoundly affected by precipitation changes. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing analysis of nirS-type functional genes, this study delved into the dynamic response mechanism of nirS-type denitrifiers to precipitation changes in the alpine wetland of Qinghai Lake. The findings revealed that a 50% increase in rainfall shifted the community assembly process of denitrifiers from deterministic to stochastic. Dominant microflora at the genus level responded significantly to precipitation changes, with aer-obic bacteria comprising the majority of differentially abundant taxa. As precipitation in-creased, the complexity of the microbial interaction network decreased. Precipitation notably emerged as the primary regulator of nirS-type denitrifiers, accounting for 51% of the variation in community composition. In summary, this study offers a fresh perspective for investigating the ecological processes of nitrogen cycling in alpine ecosystems.Abstract The nitrogen cycling process in alpine wetlands is profoundly affected by precipitation changes, yet the dynamic response mechanism of denitrifiers to long-term precipitation shifts in the alpine wetland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau remains enigmatic. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing analysis of nirS-type functional genes, this study delved into the dynamic response mechanism of nirS-type denitrifiers to precipitation changes in the alpine wetland of Qinghai Lake. The findings revealed that nirS-type denitrifiers in the alpine wetland of Qinghai Lake were primarily Proteobacteria, and Alpha diversity exhibited a negative correlation with the precipitation gradient, with deterministic processes predominating in the community assembly of denitrifying microbes. A 50% increase in rainfall shifted the community assembly process of denitrifiers from deterministic to stochastic. Dominant microflora at the genus level responded significantly to precipitation changes, with aerobic bacteria comprising the majority of differentially abundant taxa (55.56%). As precipitation increased, the complexity of the microbial interaction network decreased, and a 25% reduction in precipitation notably elevated the relative abundance of three key functional groups: chemoheterotrophic, aerobic chemoheterotrophic, and nitrogen fixation. Precipitation notably emerged as the primary regulator of nirS-type denitrifiers in the alpine wetland of Qinghai Lake, accounting for 51% of the variation in community composition. In summary, this study offers a fresh perspective for investigating the ecological processes of nitrogen cycling in alpine ecosystems by examining the diversity and community composition of nirS-type denitrifiers in response to precipitation changes.

TI  - Declining temporal effectiveness of carbon sequestration: Implications for compliance with the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB  - Carbon sequestration is increasingly being promoted as a potential response to the risks of unrestrained emissions of CO2, either in place of or as a complement to reductions in the use of fossil fuels. However, the potential role of carbon sequestration as an (at-least partial) substitute for reductions in fossil fuel use can be properly evaluated only in the context of a long-term acceptable limit ( or range of limits) to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, taking into account the response of the entire carbon cycle to artificial sequestration. Under highly stringent emission-reduction scenarios for non-CO2 greenhouse gases, 450 ppmv CO2 is the equivalent, in terms of radiative forcing of climate, to a doubling of the pre-industrial concentration of CO2. It is argued in this paper that compliance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( henceforth, the UNFCCC) implies that atmospheric CO2 concentration should be limited, or quickly returned to, a concentration somewhere below 450 ppmv. A quasi-one-dimensional coupled climate-carbon cycle model is used to assess the response of the carbon cycle to idealized carbon sequestration scenarios. The impact on atmospheric CO2 concentration of sequestering a given amount of CO2 that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere, either in deep geological formations or in the deep ocean, rapidly decreases over time. This occurs as a result of a reduction in the rate of absorption of atmospheric CO2 by the natural carbon sinks ( the terrestrial biosphere and oceans) in response to the slower buildup of atmospheric CO2 resulting from carbon sequestration. For 100 years of continuous carbon sequestration, the sequestration fraction ( defined as the reduction in atmospheric CO2 divided by the cumulative sequestration) decreases to 14% 1000 years after the beginning of sequestration in geological formations with no leakage, and to 6% 1000 years after the beginning of sequestration in the deep oceans. The difference (8% of cumulative sequestration) is due to an eflux from the ocean to the atmosphere of some of the carbon injected into the deep ocean. The coupled climate-carbon cycle model is also used to assess the amount of sequestration needed to limit or return the atmospheric CO2 concentration to 350 - 400 ppmv after phasing out all use of fossil fuels by no later than 2100. Under such circumstances, sequestration of 1 - 2 Gt C/yr by the latter part of this century could limit the peak CO2 concentration to 420 - 460 ppmv, depending on how rapidly use of fossil fuels is terminated and the strength of positive climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. To draw down the atmospheric CO2 concentration requires creating negative emissions through sequestration of CO2 released as a byproduct of the production of gaseous fuels from biomass primary energy. Even if fossil fuel emissions fall to zero by 2100, it will be difficult to create a large enough negative emission using biomass energy to return atmospheric CO2 to 350 ppmv within 100 years of its peak. However, building up soil carbon could help in returning CO2 to 350 ppmv within 100 years of its peak. In any case, a 100-year period of climate corresponding to the equivalent of a doubled-CO2 concentration would occur before temperatures decreased.
   Nevertheless, returning the atmospheric CO2 concentration to 350 ppmv would reduce longterm sea level rise due to thermal expansion and might be sufficient to prevent the irreversible total melting of the Greenland ice sheet, collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, and abrupt changes in ocean circulation that might otherwise occur given a prolonged doubled-CO2 climate. Recovery of coral reef ecosystems, if not already driven to extinction, could begin.

TI  - Change in composition and potential functional genes of soil bacterial and fungal communities with secondary succession in Quercus liaotwigensis forests of the Loess Plateau, western China
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Vegetation succession is one of the most important factors driving changes in microorganisms. It is unclear, however, how the microbial composition and the potential function of C and N cycling change with forest secondary succession. Using soil metagenomic sequencing methods, we studied these changes in bacterial and fungal communities with secondary succession from cropland to a Quercus liaotungensis forest over approximately 120 years on the Loess Plateau of China. The results revealed the following. (1) Soil microbial biomass C, N, and P increased significantly in topsoil (0-20 cm) with vegetation succession. (2) The abundances of bacteria increased initially and then decreased slightly, whereas an increase in fungal abundances and the ratio of fungi to bacteria was detected along a successional gradient. Microbial communities tended to shift from r- to K-strategists, both at the phylum and genus levels. (3) With vegetation succession, the abundances of C and N cycle-related potential functional genes first significantly increased and then stabilized. Among them, the relative abundances of recalcitrant C degradation-, N fixation-, and ammonification-related genes increased, whereas labile C degradation-, N reduction-, and denitrification-related genes tended to decrease. (4) Redundancy analysis indicated that bacterial communities were influenced by available phosphorus contents and soil C: N ratios, and that fungal communities were mainly affected by ammonium N contents and root biomass. (5) Predicted microbial functional genes were affected by ammonium N and activated C contents. Our study showed that with vegetation succession, microbe communities tended to shift from r- to K-strategists both at the phylum and genus levels, which increased the abundance of organisms expressing C- and N-cycle related genes.

TI  - Soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics throughout the summer drought in a California annual grassland
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Drought is common in soil, yet its intensity and immediate effects vary with the timing of precipitation and the depth in the soil profile. We set out to analyze the patterns of soil C and N dynamics through the dry summer in a California annual grassland, and to analyze the processes that control those dynamics. During the dry season, inorganic N, soluble organic matter, and microbial biomass accumulated in soil. Concentrations were generally greater in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm) but increased in both surface and deeper soil (10-20 cm) over the course of the summer. There was a positive relationship between drought length, microbial biomass C and N, extractable C and N, and microbial activity upon rewetting. Upon rewetting of dry soils there was a pulse in nitrate availability (under field conditions) and, in the top 10 cm, a positive correlation between the initial CO2 pulse released upon rewetting and the drought length. In contrast, below 10 cm there was no correlation between the rewetting CO2 pulse and drought length. Soils from the top 10 cm and below 10 cm dried under controlled laboratory conditions showed the same CO2 pulse response to the length of drying as those in the field. These results suggest that the substrates that accumulate during the dry season are relatively labile, and that, in surface soils, biomass/substrate amounts and water availability control their persistence, while in deeper layers, some other factor is more important.

TI  - Metagenomic study on microbial function in increasing total nitrogen content in soil under crop rotation systems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Leguminous crops, which are vital bioresources, increase total nitrogen (TN) levels in soil, effectively improving microbial and plant nutrition and achieving environment-sustainable agricultural production. However, the specific processes of the nitrogen cycle and the role of soil microorganisms in increasing TN levels after soybean planting remain unclear. Herein, a comparative analysis of microbial nitrogen-cycling genes in soil was conducted based on a 12-year crop rotation involving wheat-maize (WM), wheat-cotton (WC), and wheat-soybean (WS) rotations. After 12 years, the WS treatment increased soil TN content by 9.1 % and 19.4 % compared with the WC and WM treatments, respectively, highlighting its unique nitrogen-enriching effects. Microbial community analysis indicated that the WS treatment significantly increased Shannon and beta-diversity indices, both of which were positively correlated with TN content. Network analysis revealed three characteristic modules: module 1 (dominated by Proteobacteria/Actinobacteria) exhibited no significant correlation with TN; module 2 (dominated by Acidobacteria/Cyanobacteria), negative correlation; and module 3 (dominated by Thaumarchaeota), positive correlation. The analysis of nitrogen-cycling functional genes revealed that the nifH (nitrogen fixation) and nxrB (nitrite oxidation) genes were significantly enriched in WS soils, whereas the hao (hydroxylamine oxidation) gene abundance increased in WM soils. Further tracing indicated that WM promoted the accumulation of the hao gene by facilitating the proliferation of the Gemmatimonadetes phylum, whereas WS enhanced the expression of the nxrB gene by enriching Actinobacteria and key genera (e.g., Modestobacter, Pediococcus) and increased the abundance of the nifH gene by promoting Bradyrhizobium proliferation. This study confirmed that the WS system enhanced soil TN through a triple mechanism of constructing high-diversity microbial communities, optimizing functional microbial structures, and the promotion of functional gene expression to promote N accumulation in the soil, thereby providing a theoretical basis for improving soil nitrogen reservoirs via coordinated crop configuration and microbial regulation.

TI  - Responses of nitrogen cycling and related microorganisms to brackish wetlands formed by evapotranspiration
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
AB  - Elevated evapotranspiration due to warmer air temperature could raise salinity and nutrient levels of some inland wetlands, potentially impacting nitrogen cycling. To characterize the impact of high evapotranspiration on soil microbial nitrogen cycling in inland wetlands, we compared freshwater and brackish marsh (or non -marsh) wetlands in terms of sediment ammonia -oxidizing rate (AOR), denitrifying rate (DR), and related microbial communities in a typical inland basin, the Hulun Lake basin, in China. Results showed that marsh ecosystems (ME) exhibited 31% higher AOR and 65% higher DR than non -marsh ecosystems (NE). For NE, freshwater non -marsh wetland exhibited 12% higher AOR than brackish non -marsh wetland. This was probably due to the inhibitory effects of high NH+ 4 and salinity levels on ammonia -oxidizing archaea in brackish non -marsh wetland. Conversely, DR in brackish non -marsh wetland was 23% higher than that in freshwater non -marsh wetland, with total organic carbon (TOC) significantly influencing this difference, suggesting that the higher DR in brackish non -marsh wetland was mainly due to its higher TOC level. For ME, due to the direct and indirect interference of salinity, brackish marsh wetland displayed 26% lower AOR and 19% lower DR than freshwater marsh wetland. Besides, brackish wetlands harbored distinct ammonia -oxidizing and denitrifying microbial communities compared to freshwater wetlands. The assembly of these communities was dominated by stochastic processes, while brackish wetlands exhibited more prominent deterministic processes than freshwater wetlands. Overall, high evapotranspiration altered activities and community characteristics of ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers in inland brackish wetlands by enhancing salinity and nutrient levels, while emergent plants occurring in ME could mitigate the adverse effects of salt stress of inland brackish wetlands on nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Long-term pattern and magnitude of soil carbon feedback to the climate system in a warming world
T2  - SCIENCE
AB  - In a 26-year soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude hardwood forest, we documented changes in soil carbon cycling to investigate the potential consequences for the climate system. We found that soil warming results in a four-phase pattern of soil organic matter decay and carbon dioxide fluxes to the atmosphere, with phases of substantial soil carbon loss alternating with phases of no detectable loss. Several factors combine to affect the timing, magnitude, and thermal acclimation of soil carbon loss. These include depletion of microbially accessible carbon pools, reductions in microbial biomass, a shift in microbial carbon use efficiency, and changes in microbial community composition. Our results support projections of a long-term, self-reinforcing carbon feedback from mid-latitude forests to the climate system as the world warms.

TI  - Bioinoculants play a significant role in shaping the rhizospheric microbial community: a field study with Cajanus cajan
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - The present study is an attempt to understand the impact of bioinoculants, Azotobacter chroococcum (A), Bacillus megaterium (B), Pseudomonas fluorescens (P), on (a) soil and plant nutrient status, (b) total resident and active bacterial communities, and (c) genes and transcripts involved in nitrogen cycle, during cultivation of Cajanus cajan. In terms of available macro- and micro-nutrients, triple inoculation of the bioinoculants (ABP) competed well with chemical fertilizer (CF). Their 'non-target' effects were assessed in terms of the abundance and activity of the resident bacterial community by employing denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The resident bacterial community (16S rRNA gene) was stable, while the active fraction (16S rRNA transcripts) was influenced (in terms of abundance) by the treatments. Quantification of the genes and transcripts involved in N cycle by qPCR revealed an increase in the transcripts of nifH in the soil treated with ABP over CF, with an enhancement of 3.36- and 1.57- fold at flowering and maturity stages of plant growth, respectively. The bioinoculants shaped the resident microflora towards a more beneficial community, which helped in increasing soil N turnover and hence, soil fertility as a whole.

TI  - Global patterns and controlling factors of soil nitrification rate
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil nitrification, an important pathway of nitrogen transformation in ecosystems, produces soil nitrate that influences net primary productivity, while the by-product of nitrification, nitrous oxide, is a significant greenhouse gas. Although there have been many studies addressing the microbiology, physiology, and impacting environment factors of soil nitrification at local scales, there are very few studies on soil nitrification rate over large scales. We conducted a global synthesis on the patterns and controlling factors of soil nitrification rate normalized at 25 degrees C by compiling 3,140 observations from 186 published articles across terrestrial ecosystems. Soil nitrification rate tended to decrease with increasing latitude, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, and varied largely with ecosystem types. The soil nitrification rate significantly increased with mean annual temperature (MAT), soil nitrogen content, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, soil ammonium, and soil pH, but decreased with soil carbon:nitrogen and carbon:nitrogen of microbial biomass. The total soil nitrogen content contributed the most to the variations of global soil nitrification rate (total coefficient = 0.29) in structural equation models. The microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN; total coefficient = 0.19) was nearly of equivalent importance relative to MAT (total coefficient = 0.25) and soil pH (total coefficient = 0.24) in determining soil nitrification rate, while soil nitrogen and pH influenced soil nitrification via changing soil MBN. Moreover, the emission of soil nitrous oxide was positively related to soil nitrification rate at a global scale. This synthesis will advance our current understanding on the mechanisms underlying large-scale variations of soil nitrification and benefit the biogeochemical models in simulating global nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Emission of CO2 and CH4 From 13 Deadwood Tree Species Is Linked to Tree Species Identity and Management Intensity in Forest and Grassland Habitats
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
AB  - Deadwood is an important component of the global carbon cycle, and its decomposition releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. However, the main drivers of these greenhouse gas emissions from deadwood are not well understood. We investigated drivers that govern the CO2 and CH4 emission rates of 793 deadwood specimens from 13 different tree species, which were exposed on 27 forest and 38 grassland plots at Schorfheide-Chorin (Germany) for one year. Tree species identity was an important driver for emissions of both gases, whereas habitat type and management intensity were only important for CO2 emission rate. CO2 emission rates were positively linked to mass loss and were one-third higher in forest compared to grassland habitats. The wood traits organic extractives, lignin, and sulfur content were negatively associated with CO2 emission rates, whereas carbon, nitrogen, and magnesium content showed the opposite effect. Among climate variables, air humidity in forest and soil moisture in grassland habitats positively affected CO2 emission rates. CH4 emission rates showed a negative relationship with increasing wood density exposed in both habitat types but were positively related to tree species with higher sulfur contents. Taken together, CO2 emission rates from deadwood were well predicted by wood traits, management intensity and climatic variables, whereas CH4 emission rates were less well predictable and were influenced only by wood traits that differed from those of CO2 emissions. Our results provide a deeper insight into the mineralization processes of deadwood and should be considered in further carbon cycle assessments.

TI  - The impact of precipitation on N2O emissions during the freeze-thaw cycle in a typical grassland in Inner Mongolia
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Approximately 78 % of China's grasslands are located north of 30 degrees N latitude where seasonal freeze-thaw processes are prevalent, and the freeze-thaw cycle plays a key role in regulating N2O emissions. Climate factors, particularly winter precipitation influences soil water dynamics, thermal processes, and nitrogen cycling. Here, we hypothesize that winter precipitation significantly affects N2O emissions by altering soil water content and nitrogen cycling processes during the freeze-thaw cycle. In this study, nine measurements of N2O fluxes were conducted during the freeze-thaw periods of 2018, 2021, and 2023, along with soil water and thermal monitoring, across three grazing treatments in the Inner Mongolia Grassland: ungrazed since 1979 (UG79), ungrazed since 1999 (UG99), and continuously grazed (CG). Results show that winter precipitation was very associated with the hydrologic year, highest in 2021 (wet year), followed by 2023 (average year), and lowest in 2018 (drought year). High pulse N2O emissions occurred only in the drought year, while in the wet year, deeper soil (20-50 cm) had significantly higher N2O concentrations, but surface N2O fluxes were lower, even a negative value as a sink. Structural equation modeling indicated that cumulative winter precipitation, soil nitrogen availability (especially NH4+-N), and surface soil moisture were key factors influencing N2O emissions. Increased winter precipitation enhanced soil moisture and deep soil N2O concentrations but reduced permeability, promoting denitrification and lowering emissions. This indicates that winter precipitation affects soil N2O fluxes and concentrations through multiple mechanisms. To improve N2O emission predictions, winter precipitation dynamics and soil ammonium nitrogen must be considered.

TI  - Mechanisms Behind the Soil Organic Carbon Response to Temperature Elevations
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) represents the most dynamic component of the soil carbon pool and is pivotal in the global carbon cycle. Global temperature rise and increasing drought severity are now indisputable realities, making soil organic carbon cycling under climate warming a critical research priority. This review elucidates the mechanism of the SOC response to temperature increase in terms of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The extrinsic factors are temperature elevation methods, rainfall, and land use. Different methods of temperature increase have their own unique advantages and disadvantages. Indoor warming methods exclude other factors, making temperature the only variable, but tend to ignore carbon inputs. In situ field warming and soil displacement methods help researchers explore the response of the complete ecosystem carbon cycle to temperature increase but cannot exclude the interference of factors such as rainfall. Elevated rainfall mitigates the adverse effects of elevated temperatures on organic carbon sequestration. In addition, the response of SOC to temperature elevations vary among different land use types. The temperature sensitivity of SOC is higher in peatland (high organic matter) alpine meadows (colder regions). The intrinsic factors that affect the response of SOC to elevated temperatures are SOC components, microorganisms, SOC temperature sensitivity, and SOC stability. The SOC decomposition rate is influenced by variations in the ratios of decomposable (easily oxidizable organic carbon (EOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and microbial biomass carbon (MBC)) and stabilizing (inert organic carbon (IOC), alkyl carbon, and aromatic carbon) SOC to total organic carbon (TOC). Furthermore, temperature elevations also affect the soil microenvironment, resulting in microbial community reorganization such as changes in bacterial and fungal ratios and abundance. At the same time, soil aggregates, clay minerals, and iron and aluminum oxides protect the SOC, making it difficult to be utilized by microbial decomposition. The systematic clarification of the mechanism behind the SOC response to higher temperatures is crucial for accurately predicting and modeling global carbon cycles and effectively responding to the loss of SOC pools due to global temperature elevations.

TI  - A Rapid Approach to Determine Soil Carbon Quality and Its Relationship to Soil Greenhouse Gas Emissions
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
AB  - Soil organic matter composition controls many microbial processes in the soil matrix. How these processes interact to drive carbon cycling through greenhouse gas fluxes or carbon stabilization through biochemical transformations continues to evolve. From laboratory incubations, it is clear that low molecular weight compounds (LMWCs; e.g. dextrose, mannitol, and trehalose) can have a profound effect on microbially mediated fluxes. However, relationships between LMWCs and soil efflux have been largely unproven in field studies due to methodological constraints. In the current study we developed a novel use of Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy (NIRS) to quantify LMWCs (explaining 38-51% of the variance). Paradoxically, we found dextrose concentrations to be negatively correlated with carbon dioxide fluxes in residential sites while mannitol was positively correlated with carbon dioxide fluxes in agricultural sites. Methane fluxes were strongly correlated with trehalose indicating a potential fungal interaction with bacterial methanogens. We found no clear link between LMWCs on nitrous oxide emissions suggesting inorganic nitrogen is a stronger limiting factor. The results from this study showed how a NIRS-based approach can improve mechanistic understanding of the drivers of soil greenhouse gas fluxes.

TI  - Microbial genes highlight different trends in short term for N cycling in historical alpine pastures
T2  - CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE
AB  - Context Alpine pastures are seminatural grasslands which play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, service provisioning, and mountain livestock systems. The soil microbial communities of pasture are fundamental in ecosystem nutrient cycles, but they are relatively underexplored in European Alpine pastures. Aims We explored the many soil microbial genes encoding key functions in the nitrogen cycle in three historical alpine pastures grazed by dairy cattle, considering different soils, temporal dynamics, and exclusion of cattle grazing for one summer. Methods 216 samples were collected across four sampling times. The abundance of genetic determinants involved in nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrification (amoA bacterial and archaeal), and denitrification (nirK and nosZ) were quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Key results The terminal denitrification nosZ gene was the most sensitive indicator and responded significantly to soil chemical composition and animal grazing. Sampling time affected nitrogen fixation nifH and intermediate denitrification nirK in relation to rainfall cumulation dynamics. The amoA nitrification genes showed high variability but no significant effects from the tested factors. Conclusions In spite of a general homeostatic trend occurring in these habitats and of the short term analysis, some genes acted as sensitive reporters of soil compositional differences, intraseasonal climatic variations, and grazing disturbance. Implications A stocking rate of >0.6 livestock units per hectare can be recommended, to combine animal production with conditions that favour complete denitrification, thus potentially reducing the nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emissions. Higher livestock grazing intensity can be withstood by the ecosystem without denitrification-related drawbacks when the preceding 10 days display a cumulated rainfall lower than 22 mm.

TI  - Trophic rewilding can expand natural climate solutions
T2  - NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE
AB  - In this Perspective, the authors argue that the restoration of wild animals and their functional roles can enhance natural carbon capture and storage. They call for the scope of natural climate solutions to be broadened to include animals.
   Natural climate solutions are being advanced to arrest climate warming by protecting and enhancing carbon capture and storage in plants, soils and sediments in ecosystems. These solutions are viewed as having the ancillary benefit of protecting habitats and landscapes to conserve animal species diversity. However, this reasoning undervalues the role animals play in controlling the carbon cycle. We present scientific evidence showing that protecting and restoring wild animals and their functional roles can enhance natural carbon capture and storage. We call for new thinking that includes the restoration and conservation of wild animals and their ecosystem roles as a key component of natural climate solutions that can enhance the ability to prevent climate warming beyond 1.5 degrees C.

TI  - Diversity of nitrogen cycling genes at a Midwest long-term ecological research site with different management practices
T2  - APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Nitrogen fertilizer results in the release of nitrous oxide (N2O), a concern because N2O is an ozone-depleting substance and a greenhouse gas. Although the reduction of N2O to nitrogen gas can control emissions, the factors impacting the enzymes involved have not been fully explored. The current study investigated the abundance and diversity of genes involved in nitrogen cycling (primarily denitrification) under four agricultural management practices (no tillage [NT], conventional tillage [CT], reduced input, biologically-based). The work involved examining soil shotgun sequencing data for nine genes (napA, narG, nirK, nirS, norB, nosZ, nirA, nirB, nifH). For each gene, relative abundance values, diversity and richness indices, and taxonomic classification were determined. Additionally, the genes associated with nitrogen metabolism (defined by the KEGG hierarchy) were examined. The data generated were statistically compared between the four management practices. The relative abundance of four genes (nifH, nirK, nirS, and norB) were significantly lower in the NT treatment compared to one or more of the other soils. The abundance values of napA, narG, nifH, nirA, and nirB were not significantly different between NT and CT. The relative abundance of nirS was significantly higher in the CT treatment compared to the others. Diversity and richness values were higher for four of the nine genes (napA, narG, nirA, nirB). Based on nirS/nirK ratios, CT represents the highest N2O consumption potential in four soils. In conclusion, the microbial communities involved in nitrogen metabolism were sensitive to different agricultural practices, which in turn, likely has implications for N2O emissions.

TI  - Bacterial Keystone Taxa Regulate Carbon Metabolism in the Earthworm Gut
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - The intestinal microbiome of earthworms is a crucial component of the soil microbial community and nutrient cycling processes. If we could elucidate the role of this microbiome in regulating soil carbon metabolism, we would make a crucial contribution to understanding the ecological role of these gut bacterial taxa and to promoting sustainable agricultural development.
   As important ecosystem engineers in soils, earthworms strongly influence carbon cycling through their burrowing and feeding activities. Earthworms do not perform these roles in isolation, because their intestines create a special habitat favorable for complex bacterial communities. However, how the ecological functioning of these earthworm-microbe interactions regulates carbon cycling remains largely unknown. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the bacterial community structure and carbon metabolic activities in the intestinal contents of earthworms and compared them to those of the adjacent soils in a long-term fertilization experiment. We discovered that earthworms harbored distinct bacterial communities compared to the surrounding soil under different fertilization conditions. The bacterial diversity was significantly larger in the adjacent soils than that in the earthworm gut. Three statistically identified keystone taxa in the bacterial networks, namely, Solirubrobacterales, Ktedonobacteraceae, and Jatrophihabitans, were shared across the earthworm gut and adjacent soil. Environmental factors (pH and organic matter) and keystone taxa were important determinants of the bacterial community composition in the earthworm gut. Both PICRUSt2 (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) and FAPROTAX (Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa) predicted that carbon metabolism was significantly higher in adjacent soil than in the earthworm gut, which was consistent with the average well color development obtained by the Biolog assay. Structural equation modeling combined with correlation analysis suggested that pH, organic matter, and potential keystone taxa exhibited significant relationships with carbon metabolism. This study deepens our understanding of the mechanisms underlying keystone taxa regulating carbon cycling in the earthworm gut. IMPORTANCE The intestinal microbiome of earthworms is a crucial component of the soil microbial community and nutrient cycling processes. If we could elucidate the role of this microbiome in regulating soil carbon metabolism, we would make a crucial contribution to understanding the ecological role of these gut bacterial taxa and to promoting sustainable agricultural development. However, the ecological functioning of these earthworm-microbe interactions in regulating carbon cycling has so far not been fully investigated. In this study, we revealed, first, that the bacterial groups of Solirubrobacterales, Ktedonobacteraceae, and Jatrophihabitans were core keystone taxa across the earthworm gut and adjacent soil and, second, that the environmental factors (pH and organic carbon) and keystone taxa strongly affected the bacterial community composition and exhibited close correlations with microbial carbon metabolism. Our results provide new insights into the community assembly of the earthworm gut microbiome and the ecological importance of potential keystone taxa in regulating carbon cycling dynamics.

TI  - Hidden decomposers: Revisiting saprotrophy among soil protists and its potential impact on carbon cycling
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil protists are increasingly recognized as key players in organic matter turnover, yet their role as direct decomposers (i.e., saprotrophs) remains underexplored compared to that of bacteria and fungi. Here, we synthesize ecological, physiological, and genomic evidence to highlight the potential of protists to actively decompose organic matter and influence soil carbon cycling. We distinguish two saprotrophic strategies within protists-lysotrophic (extracellular) and phagotrophic (intracellular)-with the latter being unique to protists among microbial decomposers. By directly ingesting particulate or dissolved organic matter, phagotrophic saprotrophic protists may bypass constraints associated with extracellular decomposition, potentially providing an advantage in breaking down recalcitrant substrates. In contrast, lysotrophic saprotrophy in protists involves the secretion of enzymes, similar to bacterial and fungal decomposers. We propose that integrating protist saprotrophy into conceptual and quantitative models of soil organic matter decomposition could address critical knowledge gaps. This integration involves employing functional genomics and functional ecology methodologies to determine, in vitro, the capacity of protists to function as saprotrophs, elucidate the genetic pathways underpinning saprotrophic activities, and assess, in situ, their direct contributions to organic matter decomposition processes. Ultimately, a clearer view of the organic matter decomposition capacities of soil protists will refine our understanding of microbially driven carbon fluxes.

TI  - Responses of N2O emissions to spring thaw period in a typical continuous permafrost region of the Daxing'an Mountains, northeast China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In the context of global climate warming, spring thaw period had been changed in the permafrost regions, which significantly affect heat and water dynamics, along with soil microbial community structure and diversity, and microbially-mediated nitrogen cycle changes. However, in-situ N2O emission research is scarce in the permafrost regions and the drivers of N2O emission during spring thaw period remain unclear. We selected three type of swamp forests in the permafrost region to investigate the N2O emissions during spring thaw period from 17 March to 23 May 2017. We found that N2O emission ranged from -35.75 to 74.17 mu g m(-2)h(-1) in the permafrost region during spring thaw period, and there was no significant large burst of N2O emissions as observed in other ecosystems. The N2O emission during spring thaw period were lower than those from growing season, which were significant affected by soil temperature. During spring thaw period, swamp forest types had no significantly influence on N2O emissions, which mainly limited by NO3--N content. Stepwise multiple linear regression indicated that the air temperature, thawing depth, soil temperature, soil moisture, pH, NH4+-N, NO3--N, TOC, TN, and C/N ratio were the environmental factors which significant effecting the N2O emissions. In the field campaign, cumulative N2O emissions were mainly controlled by thawing depth, soil moisture, pH, NH4+-N, NO3--N and TN during spring thaw period. Overall, the results demonstrate that in the permafrost ecosystems spring thaw period is an important source of N2O emissions.

TI  - Impacts of silver nanoparticles on enzymatic activities, nitrifying bacteria, and nitrogen transformation in soil amended with ammonium and nitrate
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are effective antimicrobial compounds that are used in a myriad of applications. Soil microorganisms play crucial roles in nitrogen cycling, but there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the effects of AgNPs on enzymatic activity in the nitrogen cycle, nitrifying bacteria, and nitrogen transformation in soil. Herein, enzyme activities were determined following the addition of different forms of nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen ((NH4)(2)SO4), nitrate nitrogen (KNO3), and amide nitrogen (urea, CO(NH2)(2)) at 200 mg N kg(-1), into the soil amended with AgNPs at 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1). After 7 d of incubation with 10 mg kg(-1) AgNPs, the activities of urease, nitrite reductase (NiR), nitrate reductase (NaR), and hydroxylamine reductase (HyR) were reduced by 12.5%, 25.0%, 12.2%, and 24.2%, respectively. Of particular note, more than 53.5%, 61.7%, and 34.7% of NaR, NiR, and HyR activities, respectively, were inhibited at 100 mg kg(-1) AgNPs. The abundance (most probable number) of ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (AOB and NOB, respectively) was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the Cochran method. The abundance of AOB and NOB decreased when AgNPs were present in the soil. The NH4NO3 amendment increased copy numbers of bacterial and archaeal amoA nitrification functional genes, by 38.3% and 12.4%, respectively, but AgNPs at 50 mg kg(-1) decreased these values by 70% and 56.4%, respectively. The results of N-15 enrichment (atom% excess) of NH4- and NO3- experiments illustrated the influence of AgNPs on soil nitrogen transformation. According to the N-15 atom% excess detected, the conversion of N-15-labeled NH4+ to NO3- was significantly inhibited by the different levels of AgNPs in soil. The reduced gross nitrification rate further confirmed this finding. Overall, this study revealed considerable evidence that AgNPs inhibited nitrogen cycle enzyme activity, the number of nitrifying bacteria, the abundance of the amoA gene, and the gross nitrification rate. Silver nanoparticles inhibited nitrogen transformation, and the rate of nitrification was also negatively correlated with AgNP levels.

TI  - Biome-scale nitrogen fixation strategies selected by climatic constraints on nitrogen cycle
T2  - NATURE PLANTS
AB  - Dinitrogen fixation by plants (in symbiosis with root bacteria) is a major source of new nitrogen for land ecosystems(1). A long-standing puzzle(2) is that trees capable of nitrogen fixation are abundant in nitrogen-rich tropical forests, but absent or restricted to early successional stages in nitrogen-poor extra-tropical forests. This biome-scale pattern presents an evolutionary paradox(3), given that the physiological cost(4) of nitrogen fixation predicts the opposite pattern: fixers should be out-competed by non-fixers in nitrogen-rich conditions, but competitively superior in nitrogen-poor soils. Here we evaluate whether this paradox can be explained by the existence of different fixation strategies in tropical versus extra-tropical trees: facultative fixers (capable of downregulating fixation(5,6) by sanctioning mutualistic bacteria(7)) are common in the tropics, whereas obligate fixers (less able to downregulate fixation) dominate at higher latitudes. Using a game-theoretic approach, we assess the ecological and evolutionary conditions under which these fixation strategies emerge, and examine their dependence on climate-driven differences in the nitrogen cycle. We show that in the tropics, transient soil nitrogen deficits following disturbance and rapid tree growth favour a facultative strategy and the coexistence of fixers and non-fixers. In contrast, sustained nitrogen deficits following disturbance in extra-tropical forests favour an obligate fixation strategy, and cause fixers to be excluded in late successional stages. We conclude that biome-scale differences in the abundance of nitrogen fixers can be explained by the interaction between individual plant strategies and climatic constraints on the nitrogen cycle over evolutionary time.

TI  - Biochar derived from feedstock with high lignin content leads to better soil improvement performance in red soils: from the perspective of soil microbial regulation and carbon stabilization
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
AB  - Red soil in southern China has a significant potential for carbon sequestration enhancement. Therefore, this study aimed to explore more effective biochar options to enhance the soil microbial environment and investigate their effects on soil carbon cycling. Three types of biochar were prepared and analyzed: maize stover biochar (Maize-BC, low lignin content), cotton stover biochar (Cotton-BC, high lignin content), and sludge biochar (Sludge-BC, no lignin content). The structure of the soil microbial community and carbon dynamics were comprehensively analyzed. The three biochars increased soil inorganic carbon, stable organic carbon, microbial carbon, and dissolved organic carbon by 30.1%-75.5%, 37.6%-44.0%, 88.4%-248.1%, and 4.3%-73.9%, respectively. Maize-BC with lower lignin content exhibited higher abundance and diversity in soil microbial communities compared to other treatments. In contrast, the addition of Cotton-BC with higher lignin content resulted in a shift mainly in the phylum Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Overall, the soil changes induced by cotton stover were more favorable for promoting a shift in the microbial community structure toward a lower carbon cycle, enabling microorganisms to better regulate or control the soil carbon cycle. This study offers a promising approach for future research focused on enhancing soil fertility and reducing soil carbon emissions.

TI  - Impact of Saline Water Irrigation on Soil Carbon Pool Composition and the Response of Carbon Emissions to Water Regulation

AB  - In areas with freshwater resource shortages, although saline water irrigation can alleviate agricultural water-use pressure, long-term application may lead to soil salinisation and ecological function degradation, thereby affecting greenhouse gas emissions. To clarify its influence on the soil carbon cycle and greenhouse gas emissions, this study collected farmland soil subjected to long-term saline water irrigation (S1: 1 g/L, S2: 4 g/L, and S3: 8 g/L) and analysed the dynamic changes in CO2 emissions and carbon and nitrogen components through controlled indoor experiments. The soil moisture gradient was defined as follows: W1, W2, and W3 correspond to 45%, 60%, and 75% of the field water-holding capacity, respectively. The results indicated that soil total carbon and total nitrogen decreased over time and were more strongly affected by salinity than by moisture, with both parameters peaking at a salinity level of S2. Both dissolved organic carbon and microbial biomass (microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen) responded distinctly to moisture and salinity: dissolved organic carbon decreased initially and then increased as the salinity increased (S3 > S1 > S2), but it consistently decreased with increasing soil moisture (W1 > W2 > W3), while microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen rose as the soil moisture increased (W3 > W2 > W1). Microbial biomass nitrogen demonstrated higher salt tolerance than carbon biomass, peaking at S2, whereas microbial biomass carbon declined with rising salinity (S1 > S2 > S3). Soil moisture and salinity significantly influenced CO2 emissions. CO2 levels increased with rising soil moisture (W3 > W2 > W1). Moderate salinity promoted CO2 emissions, whereas high salinity suppressed them (S2 > S1 > S3). Compared to the W3S2 treatment, which showed the maximum value (p < 0.05), CO2 emissions were reduced by 13.84% in W3S1, 24.85% in W3S3, 33.63% in W1S2, and 20.54% in W2S2. These results recommend controlling irrigation salinity at <= 4 g/L and maintaining water content at 60%-75% of the water holding capacity to synergistically sustain soil health and emission reduction benefits.

TI  - Site conditions are more important than abundance for explaining plant invasion impacts on soil nitrogen cycling
T2  - ECOSPHERE
AB  - Invasive plant species can alter critical ecosystem processes including nitrogen transformations, but it is often difficult to anticipate where in an invaded landscape, these effects will occur. Our predictive ability lags because we lack a framework for understanding the multiple pathways through which environmental conditions mediate invader impacts. Here, we present a framework using structural equation modeling to evaluate the impact of an invasive grass, Microstegium vimineum (M.v.), on nitrogen cycling based on a series of invaded sites that varied in invader biomass and non-M.v. understory biomass, tree basal area, light availability, and soil conditions. Unlike previous studies, we did not find an overall pattern of elevated nitrate concentrations or higher nitrification rates in M.v.-invaded areas. We found that reference plot conditions mediated differences in mineralization between paired invaded and reference plots at each site through indirect (via M.v. biomass), direct, and interactive pathways; however, the strongest pathways were independent of M.v. biomass. For example, sites with low reference soil nitrate and high non-M.v. understory biomass tended to have faster mineralization at 5-15 cm in invaded plots. These findings suggest that more attention to reference conditions is needed to understand the impact of invasive species on soil nitrogen cycling and other ecosystem processes and that the greatest impacts will not necessarily be where the invader is most abundant.

TI  - Impact of wildfire intensity and logging on fungal and nitrogen-cycling bacterial communities in British Columbia forest soils
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Wildfire and logging are common disturbances in the forests of northwestern North America, causing changes in soil chemistry and microbiology, including fungal and nitrogen-cycling bacterial communities. These organisms play key roles in nutrient cycling, and affect the regeneration of tree seedlings after disturbance. We studied the effects of wildfire and logging on fungal and nitrogen-cycling communities in the rhizosphere of 16 month-old Douglas-fir seedlings as they regenerated in burned and logged soils. Seeds were planted against root windows that were set up vertically in the soil, with a removable front panel used to access the seedling rhizosphere soil surface. Windows were established in control, lightly burned, and severely burned plots, as well as two types of logged plots (clearcut and screefed clearcut). Soil scrapings from the root window-soil interface were taken and the structure of fungal and nitrogen-cycling communities was resolved using length-heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR) of fungal nuclear ribosomal RNA genes, and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of nifH and nosZ genes. We found striking differences in the community structure of fungal, denitrifying, and N-fixing communities in response to burning and logging. With the exception of clearcut and screefed clearcut, which were generally similar, each treatment had a unique impact on community structure for these genes. Burning and logging also impacted the relative richness and evenness of these communities. Fungal relative richness and evenness increased in response to logging and severe burning, while denitrifier relative richness and evenness increased in all disturbance treatments, and N-fixing bacterial relative richness and evenness decreased in response to burning. The greatest differences in microbial community structure, relative richness, and evenness were found in the comparisons of lightly burned and logged treatments. The results suggest that the presence of an intact forest floor influences soil microbial communities less than the presence of living trees. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Nitrate determines the bacterial habitat specialization and impacts microbial functions in a subsurface karst cave
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Karst caves are usually considered as natural laboratories to study pristine microbiomes in subsurface biosphere. However, effects of the increasingly detected nitrate in underground karst ecosystem due to the acid rain impact on microbiota and their functions in subsurface karst caves have remained largely unknown. In this study, samples of weathered rocks and sediments were collected from the Chang Cave, Hubei province and subjected to high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. The results showed that nitrate significantly impacted bacterial compositions, interactions, and functions in different habitats. Bacterial communities clustered according to their habitats with distinguished indicator groups identified for each individual habitat. Nitrate shaped the overall bacterial communities across two habitats with a contribution of 27.2%, whereas the pH and TOC, respectively, structured bacterial communities in weathered rocks and sediments. Alpha and beta diversities of bacterial communities increased with nitrate concentration in both habitats, with nitrate directly affecting alpha diversity in sediments, but indirectly on weathered rocks by lowering pH. Nitrate impacted more on bacterial communities in weathered rocks at the genus level than in sediments because more genera significantly correlated with nitrate concentration in weathered rocks. Diverse keystone taxa involved in nitrogen cycling were identified in the co-occurrence networks such as nitrate reducers, ammonium-oxidizers, and N-2-fixers. Tax4Fun2 analysis further confirmed the dominance of genes involved in nitrogen cycling. Genes of methane metabolism and carbon fixation were also dominant. The dominance of dissimilatory and assimilatory nitrate reduction in nitrogen cycling substantiated nitrate impact on bacterial functions. Our results for the first time revealed the impact of nitrate on subsurface karst ecosystem in terms of bacterial compositions, interactions, and functions, providing an important reference for further deciphering the disturbance of human activities on the subsurface biosphere.

TI  - MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF THE MICROBIAL COMMUNITY INVOLVED IN THE CARBON CYCLE IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND TYPES OF SOIL MANAGEMENT
T2  - EQA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB  - This paper addresses the diversity of two soil bacterial groups involved in the biogeochemical carbon cycle: bacteria implicated in chitin degradation and methanotrophs. To evaluate the influence of soil physico-chemical and anthropic characteristics on the diversity of these microbial groups, total DNA was directly extracted from soils differently managed and sampled in central and south Italy. PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses targeting genes coding for chitinase (chiA), particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) and 16S rRNA from bacteria, actinomycetes and type I or II methanotrophs were used to fingerprint the soil bacterial communities. DGGE cluster analysis showed a clear separation of the bacterial communities on the basis of the sampling sites. The Canonical Corrispondance Analysis (CCA) suggests that the edaphic factors such as granulometry and pH, could be responsible for determining the composition of these bacterial groups.

TI  - Measuring the effect of freezing on hydrolytic and oxidative extracellular enzyme activities associated with plant litter decomposition
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - Extracellular enzymes are the proximate drivers of biogeochemical cycling in ecosystems. In terrestrial environments, studies of extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) in soils far outpace studies in substrates such as leaf litter. Despite recent methodological advances that have made EEA assays feasible for researchers conducting large-scale studies, there are still a number of methodological uncertainties that exist, particularly when working with less studied substrates (i.e. grassland leaf litter). These uncertainties are of particular importance when considering the logistics of sample processing after collecting samples in large numbers and/or from distant field sites. Studies of soil handling suggest that while assaying biochemical and molecular markers in fresh samples is ideal, that freezing samples is often a viable solution if the former is not feasible. Due to the inherent differences of litter and soil materials and associated microenvironments, we can draw only limited conclusions from the results of studies on sample handling using soil. As a result, we investigated the effect of two typical freezing temperatures (-20 degrees and -80 degrees C) on subsequent EEAs in decomposing leaf litter material. We incubated litter material from six grassland plant communities for 12 weeks at 25 degrees C, then measured the EEA of five hydrolytic and two oxidative enzymes in fresh litter, and in litter that was frozen for four weeks at either -20 degrees or -80 degrees C. Results indicate that freezing only affected the activity of N-acetyl-beta glucosaminidase (NAG), an enzyme that was affected by freezing in prior soil studies. We observed an approximate 35% increase in NAG activity with freezing. The remaining six EEAs measured were not observed to be affected by freezing, and the level of freezing (i.e. temperature) did not influence any of the seven EEAs measured, suggesting that freezing is a suitable alternative when laboratory analyses on fresh litter samples are not logistically possible.

TI  - VARIATIONS IN THE CULTIVABLE SOIL NITROGEN-CYCLING BACTERIAL COMMUNITY ALONG THE ALTITUDE GRADIENT AT THE UPPER REACHES OF THE HEIHE RIVER, NORTHWESTERN CHINA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB  - The upper reaches of the Heihe River, located in the Qilian Mountains on the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Although there are many reports on the hydrology and vegetation of the region, there is little information about the distribution of soil microbe communities. In this study, soil samples were collected from the upper reaches of the Heihe River along an altitude gradient of 2814-4130 m above sea level. We investigated bacteria targeting three key processes of the nitrogen cycle, including nitrite oxidation, aerobic denitrification and N-2 fixation. Population fluctuations of these nitrogen-cycling bacteria were significant along the altitude gradient (P < 0.05). N-2-fixing bacteria (NFB) were present in higher numbers than nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and aerobic denitrifying bacteria (ADB). The isolates we obtained from the soil represented 48 species as assessed by sequencing PCR-amplified 16S rDNA. These species were affiliated with 13 genera belonging to alpha-Proteobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, gamma-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroides and Firmicutes. The dominant genera were Arthrobacter and Pseudomonas, while NFB was the predominant functional group in the soil samples. Statistical analysis showed that altitude and plant diversity were the principal environmental factors at the upper reaches of the Heihe River. Cultivable numbers of NOB, ADB and NFB were negatively correlated with altitude, and the diversity of NOB and ADB was primarily affected by altitude and plant diversity. However, the diversity of NFB was correlated with plant biomass and soil physicochemical properties (i.e., soil water content, organic material and total organic carbon).

TI  - Returning farmland to forests and grasslands promotes soil quality restoration in Northeast China: Evidence from soil nitrogen cycle
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soils contain a diversity of microbial communities involved in the nitrogen cycle (N-cycling), which are essential for maintaining the quality and health of soil. However, agricultural intensification has led to land use conversion, which has had a negative impact on ecosystems. There is a lack of research on the whole N-cycling process in land use change under the context of ecological restoration. Here, we utilized qPCR (Quantitative Real-time PCR) and MiSeq techniques to analyse the functional genes related to nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrification (AOA and AOB) and denitrification (norB and nosZ) to explore whether the conversion of farmland to forest and grassland affects changes in microbial communities involved in the N-cycling. We reveal the potential effects of ecological restoration on microbial community function in the N-cycling through soil properties. Specifically, land use conversion increased N-cycling gene abundance and changed in the N-cycling microbiome exhibited. The ecological restoration has increased the importance of stochastic processes in the assembly of AOA and AOB communities and affected the ecological cluster of soil N-cycling microbial network. Overall, these findings reveal specific microbial processes and interactions that influence the soil N-cycling and provide insights for future research on sustainable land management approaches that support soil health.

TI  - Global patterns of human and livestock respiration
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Carbon emissions from human and animals has been neglected by previous studies in estimating the carbon cycle of ecosystem. This study first estimates the spatial-temporal patterns of carbon emissions density from human and livestock respiration among countries around the world from 1960-2014. Then we simulate the soil heterotrophic respiration (R-h) to analyze the contribution of human and livestock respiration to total heterotrophic respiration of global ecosystem. Our results show that the respiration of human and livestock respectively contribute more than 1% of the total carbon output from heterotrophic respiration in most countries and affect more than 5% in almost half of the countries. Moreover, the effect of livestock respiration is slightly greater than that of human beings. Therefore, the estimation of heterotrophic respiration should not only consider Rh in these countries, human and livestock respiration are equally important in the research on regional carbon budget.

TI  - Unveiling novel pathways and key contributors in the nitrogen cycle: Validation of enrichment and taxonomic characterization of oxygenic denitrifying microorganisms in environmental samples
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Microorganisms play a crucial role in both the nitrogen cycle and greenhouse gas emissions. A recent discovery has unveiled a new denitrification pathway called oxygenic denitrification, entailing the enzymatic reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) by a putative nitric oxide dismutase (nod) enzyme. In this study, the presence of the nod gene was detected and subsequently enriched in anaerobic-activated sludge, farmland soil, and paddy soil samples. After 150 days, the enriched samples exhibited significant denitrification, and concomitant oxygen production. The removal efficiency of nitrite ranged from 64.6 % to 79.0 %, while the oxygen production rate was between 15.4 mu L/min and 18.6 mu L/min when exposed to a sole nitrogen source of 80 mg/L sodium nitrite. Additionally, batch experiments and kinetic analyses revealed the intricate pathways and underlying mechanisms governing the oxygenic denitrification reaction by using CARBOXY-PTIO, 18O-labelled water, and acetylene to unravel the intricacies of the reaction. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results indicated a significant surge in the abundance of nod genes, escalating from 7.59 to 10.12-fold. Moreover, analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) amplicons revealed Proteobacteria as the dominant phylum and Thauera as the main genus, with the presumed affiliation. In this study, a new nitrogen conversion pathway, oxygenic denitrification, was discovered in environmental samples. This process provides the possibility for the control of nitrous oxide in the treatment of nitrogenous wastewater.

TI  - Metabolism diversification of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria under different precipitation gradients and land legacies
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Global climate change has accelerated the nitrogen cycle. Soil nitrogen stock degradation by microbes releases various gasses, including nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) participate in the soil nitrogen cycle, producing N2O. There are outstanding questions regarding the impact of environmental processes such as precipitation and land use legacy on AOA and AOB structurally, compositionally, and functionally. To address these questions, we analyzed field soil cores and soil monoliths under varying precipitation profiles and land legacies. We used co-assembly, genome-centric metagenomics, and resolved 28 AOA and AOB Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs), and found that they were significantly higher in drier environments and differentially abundant in different land use legacies. We further dissected AOA and AOB functional potentials to understand their contribution to nitrogen transformation capabilities. We identified the involvement of stress response genes, differential metabolic functional potentials, and subtle population dynamics under different environmental parameters for AOA and AOB. We observed that AOA MAGs lacked a canonical membrane-bound electron transport chain and F-type ATPase but possessed A/Atype ATPase, while AOB MAGs had a complete complex III module and F-type ATPase, suggesting differential survival strategies of AOA and AOB. The outcomes from this study will enable us to comprehend how droughtlike environments and land use legacies could impact AOA and AOB-driven nitrogen transformations in soil.

TI  - Stimulating effects of snow cover on gaseous nitrogen emissions are intensified by biological soil crusts
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Winter weather patterns are changing due to global climate change, which impacts the soil nitrogen cycle and greenhouse gas flux in these ecosystems, particularly the snow cover in temperate deserts. Biological soil crusts are important soil communities of the desert ecosystem and are sensitive to environmental changes. However, knowledge of the responses of gaseous nitrogen emissions from biological soil crusts to changes in snow cover is limited. In this study, the effects of snow cover on gaseous nitrogen emissions and the abundance of nitrifier (amoA) and denitrifier (narG, nirS, nirK, nosZ) genes were investigated in three snow cover treatments (snow removal, ambient snow, and increased snow depth). Snow cover significantly affected N2O and NO emissions from bare sand and biological soil crusts in winter. The abundance of denitrifier genes in bare sand and biological soil crusts and the abundance of nitrifier genes in moss crust increased with the depths of snow addition. N2O emissions increased with the successional stages of biological soil crusts during the winter. Both N2O and NO emissions from bare sand and biological soil crusts peaked in the freeze-thaw period (March) and were lowest in mid-winter (January). The emissions of N2O increased with increasing the abundance of amoA, nirK and nosZ genes. Our findings show that N2O emissions generally increased with increasing snow cover through their ef-fects on nitrogen cycle related functional microbial groups. These effects were regulated by the types of bio-logical soil crust, which can increase the effect of snow cover in winter.

TI  - The Influence of Seasonal Freeze-Thaw in Northeast China on Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Microbial Community Structure in Peat Soil
T2  - WATER
AB  - Peat soil is a significant global carbon storage pool, accounting for one-third of the global soil carbon pool. Its greenhouse gas emissions have a significant impact on climate change. Seasonal freeze-thaw cycles are common natural phenomena in high-latitude and high-altitude regions. They significantly affect the mineralization of soil organic carbon and greenhouse gas emissions by altering the physical structure, moisture conditions, and microbial communities of the soil. In this study, through the construction of an indoor simulation experiment of the typical freeze-thaw cycle models in spring and autumn in the Greater Xing'an Range region of China and the Jinchuan peatland of Jilin Longwan National Nature Reserve, the physicochemical properties, greenhouse gas emission fluxes, microbial community structure characteristics, and key metabolic pathways of peat soils in permafrost and seasonally frozen ground areas were determined. The characteristics of greenhouse gas emissions and their influencing mechanisms for peat soil in northern regions under different freeze-thaw conditions were explored. The research found that the freeze-thaw cycle significantly changed the chemical properties of peat soil and significantly affected the emission rates of CO2, CH4, and N2O. It also clarified the interaction relationship between soil's physicochemical properties (such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+), soil organic carbon (SOC), etc.) and the structure and metabolic function of microbial communities. It is of great significance for accurately assessing the role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle and formulating effective ecological protection and management strategies.

TI  - Soil biochar amendment shapes the composition of N2O-reducing microbial communities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Soil biochar amendment has been described as a promising tool to improve soil quality, sequester carbon, and mitigate nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas. The main sources of N2O in soils are microbially-mediated nitrogen transformation processes such as nitrification and denitrification. While previous studies have focused on the link between N2O emission mitigation and the abundance and activity of N2O-reducing microorganisms in biochar-amended soils, the impact of biochar on the taxonomic composition of the nosZ gene carrying soil microbial community has not been subject of systematic study to date. We used 454 pyrosequencing in order to study the microbial diversity in biochar-amended and biochar-free soil microcosms. We sequenced bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons as well as fragments of common (typical) nosZ genes and the recently described 'atypical' nosZ genes. The aim was to describe biochar-induced shifts in general bacterial community diversity and taxonomic variations among the nosZ gene containing N2O-reducing microbial communities. While soil biochar amendment significantly altered the 16S rRNA gene-based community composition and structure, it also led to the development of distinct functional traits capable of N2O reduction containing typical and atypical nosZ genes related to nosZ genes found in Pseudomonas stutzeri and Pedobacter saltans, respectively. Our results showed that biochar amendment can affect the relative abundance and taxonomic composition of N2O-reducing functional microbial traits in soil. Thus these findings broaden our knowledge on the impact of biochar on soil microbial community composition and nitrogen cycling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - How can increased use of biological N2 fixation in agriculture benefit the environment?
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Asymbiotic, associative or symbiotic biological N-2 fixation (BNF), is a free and renewable resource, which should constitute an integral part of sustainable agro-ecosystems. Yet there has been a rapid increase in use of fertiliser N and a parallel decline in the cultivation of leguminous plants and BNF, especially in the developed world. Fertilisers have boosted crop yields, but intensive agricultural systems have increasingly negative effects on the atmospheric and aquatic environments. BNF, either alone or in combination with fertilisers and animal manures, may prove to be a better solution to supply nitrogen to the cropping systems of the future. This review focuses on the potential benefit of BNF on the environment especially on soil acidification, rhizosphere processes and plant CO2 fixation. As fertiliser N has supplanted BNF in agriculture the re-substitution of BNF is considered. What is the consequence of fertiliser N production on energy use? The effect of fertiliser use on the release of the greenhouse gas CO2 is estimated at approximately 1% of the global anthropogenic emission of CO2. The role of BNF on nitrogen cycling, ammonia volatilisation, N2O emission and NO3 leaching suggests that BNF is less likely than fertilisers to cause losses during pre-cropping and cropping. Sometimes however the post-harvest losses may be greater, due to the special qualities of legume residues. Nevertheless, legumes provide other 'ecological services' including improved soil structure, erosion protection and greater biological diversity.

TI  - Microbial carbon limitation: The need for integrating microorganisms into our understanding of ecosystem carbon cycling
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated that fertilization with nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium increases plant productivity in both natural and managed ecosystems, demonstrating that primary productivity is nutrient limited in most terrestrial ecosystems. In contrast, it has been demonstrated that heterotrophic microbial communities in soil are primarily limited by organic carbon or energy. While this concept of contrasting limitations, that is, microbial carbon and plant nutrient limitation, is based on strong evidence that we review in this paper, it is often ignored in discussions of ecosystem response to global environment changes. The plant-centric perspective has equated plant nutrient limitations with those of whole ecosystems, thereby ignoring the important role of the heterotrophs responsible for soil decomposition in driving ecosystem carbon storage. To truly integrate carbon and nutrient cycles in ecosystem science, we must account for the fact that while plant productivity may be nutrient limited, the secondary productivity by heterotrophic communities is inherently carbon limited. Ecosystem carbon cycling integrates the independent physiological responses of its individual components, as well as tightly coupled exchanges between autotrophs and heterotrophs. To the extent that the interacting autotrophic and heterotrophic processes are controlled by organisms that are limited by nutrient versus carbon accessibility, respectively, we propose that ecosystems by definition cannot be 'limited' by nutrients or carbon alone. Here, we outline how models aimed at predicting non-steady state ecosystem responses over time can benefit from dissecting ecosystems into the organismal components and their inherent limitations to better represent plant-microbe interactions in coupled carbon and nutrient models.

TI  - Plant-Mediated Changes in Soil N-Cycling Genes during Revegetation of Copper Mine Tailings
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Nitrogen limitation represents a major bottleneck during the revegetation of mine tailings. However, controls over key nitrogen-cycling genes in rhizospheric soils under differential vegetation management remain poorly understood. The abundance and transcriptional activity of nitrogen-cycling genes and the enzymatic activity of nitrogen transformation are mediated differentially during revegetation of mine tailings by Imperata cylindrica and Chrysopogon zizanioides plants. Results showed that the highest total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and NH4+-N contents were found in the rhizosphere of I. cylindrica. The nifH gene abundances differed between I. cylindrica and C. zizanioides, and were higher in I. cylindrica which demonstrated by 3.39-fold higher mRNA transcript abundance of the nifH gene and a 2.15-fold higher nitrogen fixation rate in the rhizosphere. In addition, C. zizanioides exhibited a 4.94-fold higher transcript abundance of the archaeal amoA gene and the highest nitrification rate (1.706 +/- 0.293 mu g N-NO2- g(-1) h(-1)) in the rhizosphere. In conclusion, I. cylindrica and C. zizanioides stimulated the abundances and activities of nifH gene and archaeal amoA gene, respectively. In addition, I. cylindrica appears to be capable of enhancing nitrogen fixation and exhibited accelerated nitrogen accumulation, which may be particularly useful for the rehabilitation of mine tailings.

TI  - Effects of plant communities on the emission of soil greenhouse gases in riparian wetlands during spring thaw
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
AB  - Spring thawing can affect the soil carbon and nitrogen cycling processes and lead to changes in the emissions of greenhouse gases. The temporal variations and impact factors of soil GHGs fluxes were measured in Phragmites australis and Carex appendiculata with the static chamber from the end of March to the end of May in 2018 in riparian wetlands of Xilin River, which is typical inland river meandering through steppe region in Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that soil CH4 and N2O emissions of the P. australis were significantly higher than those of the Carex appendiculata, whereas CO2 emissions were no significant difference. The responses of soil GHG fluxes to soil environmental factors in P. australis and Carex appendiculata differed. In the P. australis community, soil CO2 and CH4 emissions were influenced jointly by mainly the soil temperature and microbial biomass nitrogen, whereas soil N2O emission was mainly affected by the soil temperature. The dominant controlling factor for CO2 and N2O was soil temperature in the Carex appendiculata, whereas CH4 was mainly regulated by soil water content. The global warming potential of P. australis was significantly higher than that of Carex appendiculata. Those findings highlight the difference in soil greenhouse gas fluxes in different plant communities and the importance of CH4 and N2O emissions during the spring thaw, which contributes to predicting the riparian wetland soil greenhouse gases and their global warming potential under global climate changes.

TI  - Grazing-induced reduction of natural nitrous oxide release from continental steppe
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) have increased significantly since pre-industrial times owing to anthropogenic perturbation of the global nitrogen cycle(1,2), with animal production being one of the main contributors(3). Grasslands cover about 20 per cent of the temperate land surface of the Earth and are widely used as pasture. It has been suggested that high animal stocking rates and the resulting elevated nitrogen input increase N2O emissions(4-7). Internationally agreed methods to upscale the effect of increased livestock numbers on N2O emissions are based directly on per capita nitrogen inputs(8). However, measurements of grassland N2O fluxes are often performed over short time periods(9), with low time resolution and mostly during the growing season. In consequence, our understanding of the daily and seasonal dynamics of grassland N2O fluxes remains limited. Here we report year-round N2O flux measurements with high and low temporal resolution at ten steppe grassland sites in Inner Mongolia, China. We show that short-lived pulses of N2O emission during spring thaw dominate the annual N2O budget at our study sites. The N2O emission pulses are highest in ungrazed steppe and decrease with increasing stocking rate, suggesting that grazing decreases rather than increases N2O emissions. Our results show that the stimulatory effect of higher stocking rates on nitrogen cycling(4,7) and, hence, on N2O emission is more than offset by the effects of a parallel reduction in microbial biomass, inorganic nitrogen production and wintertime water retention. By neglecting these freeze-thaw interactions, existing approaches may have systematically overestimated N2O emissions over the last century for semi-arid, cool temperate grasslands by up to 72 per cent.

TI  - Trends in Microbial Community Composition and Function by Soil Depth
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Microbial communities play important roles in soil health, contributing to processes such as the turnover of organic matter and nutrient cycling. As soil edaphic properties such as chemical composition and physical structure change from surface layers to deeper ones, the soil microbiome similarly exhibits substantial variability with depth, with respect to both community composition and functional profiles. However, soil microbiome studies often neglect deeper soils, instead focusing on the top layer of soil. Here, we provide a synthesis on how the soil and its resident microbiome change with depth. We touch upon soil physicochemical properties, microbial diversity, composition, and functional profiles, with a special emphasis on carbon cycling. In doing so, we seek to highlight the importance of incorporating analyses of deeper soils in soil studies.

TI  - Diversity of Ammonia Oxidation (amoA) and Nitrogen Fixation (nifH) Genes in Lava Caves of Terceira, Azores, Portugal
T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Lava caves are an understudied ecosystem in the subterranean world, particularly in regard to nitrogen cycling. The diversity of ammonia oxidation (amoA) and nitrogen fixation (nifH) genes in bacterial mats collected from lava cave walls on the island of Terceira (Azores, Portugal) was investigated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). A total of 55 samples were collected from 11 lava caves that were selected with regard to surface land use. Land use types above the lava caves were categorized into pasture, forested, and sea/urban, and used to determine if land use influenced the ammonia oxidizing and nitrogen fixing bacterial communities within the lava caves. The soil and water samples from each lava cave were analyzed for total organic carbon, inorganic carbon, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate, phosphate and sulfate, to determine if land use influences either the nutrient content entering the lava cave or the nitrogen cycling bacteria present within the cave. Nitrosospira-like sequences dominated the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) community, and the majority of the diversity was found in lava caves under forested land. The nitrogen fixation community was dominated by Klebsiella pneumoniae-like sequences, and diversity was evenly distributed between pasture and forested land, but very little overlap in diversity was observed. The results suggest that land use is impacting both the AOB and the nitrogen fixing bacterial communities.

CP  - International Symposium on Impacts of Soil Biodiversity on Biogeochemical Processes in Ecosystems
AB  - Soil nitrogen cycling is accomplished by a diverse microbial community using several nitrogen functional genes (NFGs). The relationship between the composition of these communities and nitrogen cycling processes is poorly understood. We developed techniques to quantify several important NFGs nitrogen transformations including fixation (nifH), ammonia oxidation (amoA), nitrogen reduction (nirS and nirK), and nitrous oxide reduction (nosZ) using quantitative real-time PCR with SybrGreen. Standard curves with known gene copies of each target molecule were developed using genomic DNA extracted from pure cultures. Primers from previously published studies were successfully used to amplify and quantify each NFGs in DNA extracted from two forest soils. Some soil samples inhibited PCR amplification of positive control DNA, and required further purification, which alleviated the problem. Two forest soils from Harvard Forest, MA and Duke Forest, NC differed greatly in their relative abundance of NFGs. The abundance of the amoA gene, associated with ammonia oxidation, was greater at Harvard Forest. The nifH gene, associated with N fixation, was more abundant at Duke Forest. These differences may reflect contrasting N cycling processes, however other published data do not indicate strong differences in gross N cycling rates. This technique can be widely adapted to quantify functional genes from a variety of complex environmental samples, and its utility could be further extended by amplifying mRNA using a reverse transcriptase-PCR procedure.

TI  - Ammonia-oxidizing archaea involved in nitrogen removal
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
AB  - Ammonia oxidation is critical to global nitrogen cycling and is often thought to be driven only by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The recent finding of new ammonia-oxidizing organisms belonging to the archaeal domain challenges this perception. Two major microbial groups are now believed to be involved in ammonia oxidation: chemolithotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria(AOB) and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA). Candidatus "Nitrosopumilus maritimus", the first isolated ammonia-oxidizing archaeon from a tropical marine aquarium tank, representative of the ubiquitous marine group 1 Crenarchaeota, contains putative genes for all three subunits (amoA, amoB, and amoC) of ammonia monooxygenase, the key enzyme responsible for ammonia oxidation. In this article, important concepts of the nitrogen cycle, ammonia oxidation processes, ammonia-oxidizing organisms, and their physiology are described. AOA are found to thrive in various habitats including hot/thermal springs, marine and fresh waters, soils, and wastewater treatment systems, where they may outnumber their counterpart, AOB. Various molecular tools have been applied to study AOB and AOA and determine their abundance and community structure changes from natural and engineered systems. The presence of AOA in activated sludge opens new opportunities for elucidating its role of ammonia removal in wastewater treatment plants and wetlands. Several significant questions related to AOA research have been raised to evoke reader involvement for broadening future studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Response of Soil Nitrogen Cycle Microbial Functions to Ecological Reconstruction in Saline-Alkali Soils: A Dual Perspective of Natural Succession and Alfalfa Cropping
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Alfalfa cropping has shown significant potential in rehabilitating degraded saline-alkali soils. However, the mechanisms linking microbial activities to soil nitrogen turnover are poorly understood. Therefore, this study examined the abundance and microbial community of functional nitrogen cycling (N-cycling) genes (nifH, AOB, nirK, nirS, norB, and nosZ) in artificial alfalfa fields, naturally successional Suaeda glauca fields, and bare land. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and MiSeq sequencing were employed to characterize the microbial communities. Our results revealed that soil properties, particularly pH, electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and alkaline hydrolyzable nitrogen (AHN), played critical roles in shaping the structure of N-cycling microbial communities. Proteobacteria emerged as the dominant phylum associated with N-cycling functions. Among the three alfalfa varieties tested, the Zhaodong variety consistently outperformed others, exhibiting significantly higher abundances of nifH-, nirS-, norB-, and nosZ-harboring microorganisms. Notably, compared to bare land, the community assembly processes of nirS in S. glauca fields and those of nifH-, AOB, nirS-, and norB- in alfalfa fields shifted from deterministic to more stochastic patterns. This transition contributed to increased microbial diversity and enhanced network stability, indicating improved ecological resilience. Alfalfa cropping and S. glauca natural succession both stimulated nitrogen fixation and nitrification, enhancing soil nitrogen retention and overall soil health. And alfalfa more effectively boosted microbial diversity, community stability, and N turnover, demonstrating greater potential for saline-alkali soil remediation than natural S. glauca succession.

TI  - Geographical and environmental drivers of ureolytic microbial communities and their roles in nitrogen cycling under fertilization
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Prokaryotic ureolytic microorganisms play a pivotal role in nitrogen cycling within agricultural ecosystems, driving the conversion of urea into ammonia and participating in various nitrogen-related processes. Despite their importance, there remains a critical gap in our understanding regarding how geographical conditions, soil properties, and biotic interactions, especially under the influence of long-term fertilization, shape the diversity and potential functionality of these microorganisms. In this study, we employed a comprehensive ecological approach to elucidate the factors influencing the biodiversity of prokaryotic ureolytic microorganisms. Our findings revealed that geographical location had the most substantial impact on ureolytic microbial alpha diversity (p < 0.001), explaining nearly half of the observed variation, while fertilization contributed less. However, site-specific responses to fertilization were observed, with increases in Shannon diversity of up to 15 % in some locations and decreases of approximately 10 % in others. Distance-decay analysis showed steeper slopes under fertilization (-4.30 for the Control,-5.43 for NPK (mineral NPK fertilizers), and-6.96 for NPKOM (mineral NPK fertilizers plus organic amendments)), indicating greater heterogeneity in community composition. Co-occurrence network analysis identified five major ecological modules, whose correlations with soil properties (e.g., dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH and NH4+-N) and functional genes (e.g., amoA, napA, nirS, nifH) in nitrogen cycle varied significantly across fertilization treatments. For instance, under NPK treatment, Module #3 showed a strengthened positive correlation with amoA gene abundance (r = 0.71, p < 0.001), while the negative correlation between Module #4 and DOC became insignificant in NPKOM. These results demonstrate the complex interplay among geography, environmental selection, and biotic interactions in driving ureolytic microbial diversity and functionality under fertilization, offering valuable insights for sustainable soil management practices.

TI  - Unravelling how biochar and dung amendments determine the functional structure and community assembly related to methane metabolisms in grassland soils
T2  - BIOCHAR
AB  - Biochar and dung amendments have been extensively employed in soil remediation and fertilization of grasslands, which are the largest terrestrial sinks for methane. However, how these exogenous amendments regulate methane metabolisms at the molecular and community levels remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the functional genes and community assemblies of methanogens and methanotrophs using Geochip 5.0 and high-throughput sequencing to reveal the impacts of biochar and dung on soil methanogenesis and methane oxidation. The interactions between methane metabolic genes and other biogeochemical genes were also examined. According to Geochip microarrays, methanogenic gene mcrA decreased and increased with dung or biochar amendment, respectively; The methanotrophic gene pmoA showed a reverse but not significant tendency. Undominated processes contributed 65.51% to replace homogeneous selections as primary driving forces of methanogen assembly after dung amendment; the contribution of dispersal limitation increased to 46.13% in methanotroph assembly after biochar amendment. The diversity and association of co-occurrence networks for carbon-nitrogen cycling genes decreased after exogenous amendments. These results indicated that biochar and dung amendments prominently regulated the functional genes and community assembly involved in methane metabolisms. The co-existence patterns of methane metabolic genes and other related geochemical genes were also shaped by these amendments. This study provides the scientific reference for the development of grassland management in the context of global warming.

TI  - Radiocarbon signature reveals that most springtails depend on carbon from living plants
T2  - BIOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Terrestrial carbon cycling is largely mediated by soil food webs. Identifying the carbon source for soil animals has been desired to distinguish their roles in carbon cycling, but it is challenging for small invertebrates at low trophic levels because of methodological limitations. Here, we combined radiocarbon (C-14) analysis with stable isotope analyses (C-13 and N-15) to understand feeding habits of soil microarthropods, especially focusing on springtail (Collembola). Most Collembola species exhibited lower Delta C-14 values than litter regardless of their delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures, indicating their dependence on young carbon. In contrast with general patterns across all taxonomic groups, we found a significant negative correlation between delta N-15 and Delta C-14 values among the edaphic Collembola. This means that the species with higher delta N-15 values depend on C from more recent photosynthate, which suggests that soil-dwelling species generally feed on mycorrhizae to obtain root-derived C. Many predatory taxa exhibited higher Delta C-14 values than Collembola but lower than litter, indicating non-negligible effects of collembolan feeding habits on the soil food web. Our study demonstrated the usefulness of radiocarbon analysis, which can untangle the confounding factors that change collembolan delta N-15 values, clarify animal feeding habits and define the roles of organisms in soil food webs.

T2  - WATER BIOLOGY AND SECURITY
AB  - Micro(nano)plastics (MNPs) are a growing problem as persistent environmental pollutants. Here, we investigated the impact of MNPs on microorganisms in aquatic microbial floc exposed to NPs (80 nm) and MPs (8 mu m) for 35 days. Water quality indicators were tested weekly and microbiological analyses were conducted on Day 7 and 28 after exposure. The results showed that there were significant differences in the levels of total ammonia nitrogen or nitrite between the MNPs groups and the control group, spanning from Day 7 to Day 28. For the microbial response, microbial community richness in the NPs and MPs groups were significantly increased at Day 7. Functional prediction showed that the relative abundances of bacteria associated with the "Forms Biofilms", "Potentially Pathogenic", "Plastic Degradation" and nitrogen cycle processes were significantly different after MNPs exposure. The results suggest that MNPs had no significant effect on the microbial diversity of mature microbial flocs. Findings suggest MPs could cause an increase in the relative abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria, while NPs do not. In addition, stress associated with MNPs affected the nitrogen cycle of microorganisms, and NPs exerted greater impacts than MPs. Findings from this study further our understanding of the impact of MNPs at environmentally relevant concentrations on microorganisms in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Wheat Straw Return Influences Nitrogen-Cycling and Pathogen Associated Soil Microbiota in a Wheat-Soybean Rotation System
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Returning straw to soil is an effective way to sustain or improve soil quality and crop yields. However, a robust understanding of the impact of straw return on the composition of the soil microbial communities under field conditions has remained elusive. In this study, we characterized the effects of wheat straw return on soil bacterial and fungal communities in a wheat-soybean rotation system over a 3-year period, using Illumina-based 16S rRNA, and internal transcribed region (ITS) amplicon sequencing. Wheat straw return significantly affected the alpha-diversity of the soil bacterial, but not fungal, community. It enhanced the relative abundance of the bacterial phylum Proteobacteria and the fungal phylum Zygomycota, but reduced that of the bacterial phylum Acidobacteria, and the fungal phylum Ascomycota. Notably, it enriched the relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling bacterial genera such as Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium. Preliminary analysis of soil chemical properties indicated that straw return soils had significantly higher total nitrogen (TN) contents than no straw return soils. In addition, the relative abundance of fungal genera containing pathogens was significantly lower in straw return soils relative to control soils, such as Fusarium, Alternaria, and Myrothecium. These results suggested a selection effect from the 3-year continuous straw return treatment and the soil bacterial and fungal communities were moderately changed.

TI  - Soil moisture and abundance of microbial groups are key determinants of greenhouse gas fluxes in a semi-arid wetland ecosystem
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Wetlands are important locations for the release of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). However, the specific mechanisms driving these emissions, particularly in semiarid wetland ecosystems, remain unclear. This study examined the spatial variability of greenhouse gas fluxes across different hydrological gradients and explored the influence of soil physicochemical and microbiological properties on these emissions within the Ulansuhai Wetland in northern China. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted using soil samples collected in-situ from different hydrological zones. The relationships between greenhouse gas fluxes and soil properties, microbial communities, and functional genes were analyzed primarily using correlation analysis and structural equation modeling. The results demonstrated that the infra-littoral and supralittoral zones primarily contributed to CH4 and CO2 emissions, whereas the epilittoral zone was the primary source of N2O emissions and CH4 sinks. Variations in CH4, CO2, and N2O emission rates were driven by a combination of soil physicochemical properties (e.g., moisture content, total organic carbon, and nitrate concentrations) and dominant microbial abundances (e.g., Alphaproteobacteria and Thiobacillus). Additionally, the pmoA and nosZ genes encoding enzymes involved in CH4 and N2O production did not fully elucidate gas fluxes, highlighting the need to consider additional functional genes in greenhouse gas assessments. Our findings indicate the significance of soil environments and functional microorganisms in regulating carbon and nitrogen cycling processes. This knowledge can contribute to the development of strategies aimed at mitigating the greenhouse effect in semi-arid wetlands.

TI  - Effects of microplastics on sedimentary greenhouse gas emissions and underlying microbiome-mediated mechanisms: A comparison of sediments from distinct altitudes
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are emerging contaminants in aquatic ecosystems that can profoundly affect carbon and nitrogen cycling. However, the impact mechanisms of MPs on sedimentary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at distinct altitudes remain poorly elucidated. Here, we investigated the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polylactic acid (PLA) on sedimentary CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions at distinct altitudes of the Yellow River. PVC increased the relative abundance of denitrifiers (e.g., Xanthobacteriaceae, Rhodocyclaceae) to promote N2O emissions, whereas PLA reduced the abundance of AOA gene and denitrifiers (e.g., Pseudomonadaceae, Sphingomonadaceae), impeding N2O emissions. Both PVC and PLA stimulated the growth of microbes (Saprospiraceae, Aquabacterium, and Desulfuromonadia) associated with complex organics degradation, leading to increased CO2 emissions. Notably, the concurrent inhibition of PLA on mcrA and pmoA genes led to its minimal impact on CH4 emissions. High-altitude MQ sediments, characterized by abundant substrate and a higher abundance of functional genes (AOA, AOB, nirK, mcrA), demonstrated higher GHG emissions. Conversely, lower microbial diversity rendered the low-altitude LJ microbial community more susceptible to PVC, leading to a more significant promotion on GHG emissions. This study unequivocally confirms that MPs exacerbate GHG emissions via microbiome-mediated mechanisms, providing a robust theoretical foundation for microplastic control to mitigate global warming.

TI  - Linking vegetation and soil functions during secondary forest succession in the Atlantic forest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Secondary forest succession can be an effective and low-cost strategy to increase forest cover and the associated biodiversity and soil functions. However, little is known about how soil functions develop during succession, and how vegetation attributes influence soil functions, especially in highly biodiverse and fragmented landscapes in the tropics. Here we assessed a wide range of indicators of taxonomic (e.g. number of tree species), structural (e.g. basal area, canopy openness) and functional diversity (e.g. community weighted means of functional traits) of tree species, as well as indicators for soil functions related to soil organic matter accumulation, nutrient cycling and soil cover in secondary forest patches ranging from 5 to 80 years. Two recently abandoned agricultural fields were included as the starting point of forest succession and two primary forest patches served as references for the end point of forest succession. Four ecological hypotheses, centred around the role of functional diversity, structural diversity and biomass, were tested to explore mechanisms in which forest vegetation may influence soil functions. Most measures of structural, taxonomic and functional diversity converged to values found in primary forests after 25-50 years of succession, whereas functional composition changed from acquisitive to conservative species. Soil carbon and nutrient cycling showed a quick recovery to the levels of primary forests after 15 years of succession. Although soil cover also increased during succession, levels of primary forests were not reached within 80 years. Variation in tree height and trait dominance were identified as aboveground drivers of carbon and nutrient cycling, while aboveground biomass was the main driver of litter accumulation, and the associated soil cover and water retention. Our results indicate that secondary forest succession can lead to a relative fast recovery of nutrient and carbon cycling functions, but not of soil cover. Our findings highlight the essential role of secondary forests in providing multiple ecosystem services. These results can be used to inform management and reforestation programmes targeted at strengthening soil functions, such as soil cover, nutrient and carbon cycling.

TI  - Soil physicochemical and microbial properties affect nitrogen cycling in technogenically transformed coal dump soils
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Mining industrial sectors deteriorate local and regional environmental quality, contributing to global ecosystem contamination. The activities of microorganisms and enzymes involved in nitrogen cycling processes were investigated in coal dump soils that had undergone technogenic transformations and reclamation. Compared to the background uncontaminated soil, the heavy metal concentrations increased to high contamination levels (the contents of mobile forms of Zn, Ni, and Cu were 66.9; 35.6; 12.9 mg/kg, respectively), salinity increased to 0.1-2.41 %. The activities of nitrification and denitrification as well as the abundance of ammonifiers reduced due to high concentrations of mobile forms, the presence of coal particles, and the salinity of soil samples. The urease activity decreased due to reduced content of soluble organic matter in disturbed soils (2.3 times lower than the background soils). Mechanical reclamation leads to a 4-fold decrease in soil toxicity levels; however, it does not enhance nitrogen cycling activity. The activity of nitrification and urease decreased by >4 times as compared to the soil of the protected area. Microbial community composition of coal mine soils was similar to that of undisturbed soil. Nitrifiers in coal mine soil were represented by the genera Nitrososphaera, , Candidatus Nitrosocosmicus, , Nitrosospira, , Nitrosomonas, , Nitrosococcus, , Nitrospira, , Nitrobacter. . The results indicated that the disruption of nitrification process led to low nitrate content in technogenically transformed coal dump soils.

TI  - Dissimilar responses of fungal and bacterial communities to soil transplantation simulating abrupt climate changes
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Both fungi and bacteria play essential roles in regulating soil carbon cycling. To predict future carbon stability, it is imperative to understand their responses to environmental changes, which is subject to large uncertainty. As current global warming is causing range shifts toward higher latitudes, we conducted three reciprocal soil transplantation experiments over large transects in 2005 to simulate abrupt climate changes. Six years after soil transplantation, fungal biomass of transplanted soils showed a general pattern of changes from donor sites to destination, which were more obvious in bare fallow soils than in maize cropped soils. Strikingly, fungal community compositions were clustered by sites, demonstrating that fungi of transplanted soils acclimatized to the destination environment. Several fungal taxa displayed sharp changes in relative abundance, including Podospora, Chaetomium, Mortierella and Phialemonium. In contrast, bacterial communities remained largely unchanged. Consistent with the important role of fungi in affecting soil carbon cycling, 8.1%-10.0% of fungal genes encoding carbon-decomposing enzymes were significantly (p < 0.01) increased as compared with those from bacteria (5.7%-8.4%). To explain these observations, we found that fungal occupancy across samples was mainly determined by annual average air temperature and rainfall, whereas bacterial occupancy was more closely related to soil conditions, which remained stable 6 years after soil transplantation. Together, these results demonstrate dissimilar response patterns and resource partitioning between fungi and bacteria, which may have considerable consequences for ecosystem-scale carbon cycling.

TI  - Microbial Community Structure and Functional Potential in Cultivated and Native Tallgrass Prairie Soils of the Midwestern United States
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The North American prairie covered about 3.6 million-km(2) of the continent prior to European contact. Only 1-2% of the original prairie remains, but the soils that developed under these prairies are some of the most productive and fertile in the world, containing over 35% of the soil carbon in the continental United States. Cultivation may alter microbial diversity and composition, influencing the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, and other dements. Here, we explored the structure and functional potential of the soil microbiome in paired cultivated-corn (at the time of sampling) and never-cultivated native prairie soils across a three-states transect (Wisconsin, Iowa, and Kansas) using metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and lipid analysis. At the Wisconsin site, we also sampled adjacent restored prairie and switchgrass plots. We found that agricultural practices drove differences in community composition and diversity across the transect. Microbial biomass in prairie samples was twice that of cultivated soils, but alpha diversity was higher with cultivation. Metagenome analyses revealed denitrification and starch degradation genes were abundant across all soils, as were core genes involved in response to osmotic stress, resource transport, and environmental sensing. Together, these data indicate that cultivation shifted the microbiome in consistent ways across different regions of the prairie, but also suggest that many functions are resilient to changes caused by land management practices - perhaps reflecting adaptations to conditions common to tallgrass prairie soils in the region (e.g., soil type, parent material, development under grasses, temperature and rainfall patterns, and annual freeze-thaw cycles). These findings are important for understanding the long-term consequences of land management practices to prairie soil microbial communities and their genetic potential to carry out key functions.

TI  - Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations caused a shift of the metabolically active microbiome in vineyard soil
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - BackgroundElevated carbon dioxide concentrations (eCO(2)), one of the main causes of climate change, have several consequences for both vine and cover crops in vineyards and potentially also for the soil microbiome. Hence soil samples were taken from a vineyard free-air CO2 enrichment (VineyardFACE) study in Geisenheim and examined for possible changes in the soil active bacterial composition (cDNA of 16S rRNA) using a metabarcoding approach. Soil samples were taken from the areas between the rows of vines with and without cover cropping from plots exposed to either eCO(2) or ambient CO2 (aCO(2)).ResultsDiversity indices and redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that eCO(2) changed the active soil bacterial diversity in grapevine soil with cover crops (p-value 0.007). In contrast, the bacterial composition in bare soil was unaffected. In addition, the microbial soil respiration (p-values 0.04-0.003) and the ammonium concentration (p-value 0.003) were significantly different in the samples where cover crops were present and exposed to eCO(2). Moreover, under eCO(2) conditions, qPCR results showed a significant decrease in 16S rRNA copy numbers and transcripts for enzymes involved in N-2 fixation and NO2- reduction were observed using qPCR. Co-occurrence analysis revealed a shift in the number, strength, and patterns of microbial interactions under eCO(2) conditions, mainly represented by a reduction in the number of interacting ASVs and the number of interactions.ConclusionsThe results of this study demonstrate that eCO(2) concentrations changed the active soil bacterial composition, which could have future influence on both soil properties and wine quality.

TI  - The response mechanism of high-quality grass to typical poisonous weed root exudates and litter: Using Leymus chinensis and Stellera chamaejasme as examples
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Poisonous weeds growing and spreading on degraded grasslands can not only impose allelopathic effects on neighboring plants through root exudates, but also change the nutritional status of soil through litter input. However, it still remains unclear how interactions between the root exudates and litter of poisonous weeds affect their neighboring plants. Stellera chamaejasme is a typical poisonous weed with allelopathic effects, distributed alongside the dominant species Leymus chinensis in the gradually degrading Songnen Grasslands, China. In the current study, a two-factor randomized block experiment was designed, where S. chamaejasme root exudates and litter were added to potted L. chinensis. Then, the effects of S. chamaejasme root exudates (SRE), litter, and their interactions on the biomass, rhizosphere soil nutrients, and bacterial community structure of L. chinensis were tested. The results indicated that SRE can inhibit the aboveground biomass of L. chinensis by increasing the pH and reducing the total carbon of the rhizosphere soil; litter addition did not significantly affect the biomass of L. chinensis. In addition, SRE and litter significantly altered the bacterial community structure; they also impacted the biomass of L. chinensis by enriching bacterial functional groups of nitrogen cycle or inhibiting carbon cycle in the rhizosphere soil. Therefore, SRE and litter can affect the growth of L. chinensis by changing the soil pH, as well as carbon and nitrogen nutrients, while litter addition might weaken the allelopathic effects induced by SRE. In this process, specific bacterial functional groups are key mediating factors. This study partially reveals the complex interaction between SRE and litter for L. chinensis and clarifies the mediating role of bacterial functional groups. This knowledge unlocks a better understanding of the allelopathic mechanism of poisonous weeds and the regulatory role of soil bacteria in degraded grasslands.

TI  - Interactions of fertilisation and crop productivity in soil nitrogen cycle microbiome and gas emissions
T2  - SOIL
AB  - Fertilised soils are a significant source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a highly active greenhouse gas and a stratospheric ozone depleter. Nitrogen (N) fertilisers, while boosting crop yield, also lead to N2O emissions into the atmosphere, impacting global warming. We investigated relationships between mineral N fertilisation rates and additional manure amendment with different crop types through the analysis of abundances of N cycle functional genes, soil N2O and N2 emissions, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), soil physicochemical analysis and biomass production. Our study indicates that N2O emissions are predominantly dependent on the mineral N fertilisation rate and enhance with an increased mineral N fertilisation rate. Crop type also has a significant impact on soil N2O emissions. Higher N2O emissions were attained with the application of manure in comparison to mineral fertilisation. Manure amendment also increased the number of N cycle genes that are significant in the variations of N2O. The study indicates that N2O emissions were mainly related to nitrification in the soil. Quantification of nitrogen cycle functional genes also showed the potential role of denitrification, comammox (complete ammonia oxidation) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) processes as a source of N2O. Our study did not find soil moisture to be significantly linked to N2O emissions. The results of the study provide evidence that, for wheat, a fertilisation rate of 80 kg N ha-1 is closest to the optimal rate for balancing biomass yield and N2O emissions and achieving a high NUE. Sorghum showed good potential for cultivation in temperate climates, as it showed a similar biomass yield compared to the other crop types and fertilisation rates but maintained low N2O emissions and N losses in a mineral N fertilisation rate of 80 kg N ha-1.

TI  - Mediterranean grassland soil C-N compound turnover is dependent on rainfall and depth, and is mediated by genomically divergent microorganisms
T2  - NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Soil microbial activity drives the carbon and nitrogen cycles and is an important determinant of atmospheric trace gas turnover, yet most soils are dominated by microorganisms with unknown metabolic capacities. Even Acidobacteria, among the most abundant bacteria in soil, remain poorly characterized, and functions across groups such as Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi and Rokubacteria are understudied. Here, we have resolved 60 metagenomic and 20 proteomic data sets from a Mediterranean grassland soil ecosystem and recovered 793 near-complete microbial genomes from 18 phyla, representing around one-third of all microorganisms detected. Importantly, this enabled extensive genomics-based metabolic predictions for these communities. Acidobacteria from multiple previously unstudied classes have genomes that encode large enzyme complements for complex carbohydrate degradation. Alternatively, most microorganisms encode carbohydrate esterases that strip readily accessible methyl and acetyl groups from polymers like pectin and xylan, forming methanol and acetate, the availability of which could explain the high prevalence of C-1 metabolism and acetate utilization in genomes. Microorganism abundances among samples collected at three soil depths and under natural and amended rainfall regimes indicate statistically higher associations of inorganic nitrogen metabolism and carbon degradation in deep and shallow soils, respectively. This partitioning decreased in samples under extended spring rainfall, indicating that long-term climate alteration can affect both carbon and nitrogen cycling. Overall, by leveraging natural and experimental gradients with genome-resolved metabolic profiles, we link microorganisms lacking prior genomic characterization to specific roles in complex carbon, C-l , nitrate and ammonia transformations, and constrain factors that impact their distributions in soil.

TI  - Consequences of microbial diversity in forest nitrogen cycling: diverse ammonifiers and specialized ammonia oxidizers
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - We tested the ecosystem functions of microbial diversity with a focus on ammonification (involving diverse microbial taxa) and nitrification (involving only specialized microbial taxa) in forest nitrogen cycling. This study was conducted on a forest slope, in which the soil environment and plant growth gradually changed. We measured the gross and net rates of ammonification and nitrification, the abundance of predicted ammonifiers and nitrifiers, and their community compositions in the soils. The abundance of predicted ammonifiers did not change along the soil environmental gradient, leading to no significant change in the gross ammonification rate. On the other hand, the abundance of nitrifiers and the gross nitrification rate gradually changed. These accordingly determined the spatial distribution of net accumulation of ammonium and nitrate available to plants. The community composition of predicted ammonifiers gradually changed along the slope, implying that diverse ammonifiers were more likely to include taxa that were acclimated to the soil environment and performed ammonification at different slope locations than specialized nitrifiers. Our findings suggest that the abundance of ammonifiers and nitrifiers directly affects the corresponding nitrogen transformation rates, and that their diversity affects the stability of the rates against environmental changes. This study highlights the role of microbial diversity in biogeochemical processes under changing environments and plant growth.

TI  - Response of soil labile organic carbon fractions and carbon-cycle enzyme activities to vegetation degradation in a wet meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Vegetation degradation resulting from climate change and human activities in wet meadows is an important issue worldwide. This phenomenon is known to influence soil labile organic carbon (LOC) and enzyme activities due to changes in environmental conditions. However, little is known about the response of LOC and enzyme activities to vegetation degradation in high-altitude wet meadows. In this study, we examined the response of LOC and carbon-cycle enzyme activities to different intensities of vegetation degradation (i.e., non-degraded (ND), slightly degraded (SD) moderately degraded (MD), and heavily degraded (HD)) in a Tibetan wet meadow. The contents of soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) and the carbon-cycle enzyme activities (i.e., cellulase, amylase and beta-glucosidase) were investigated in two growing seasons (2016 and 2017). We found that the content of soil SOC and LOC fractions declined with increasing soil depth in each degraded level except for HD. Vegetation degradation significantly decreased the amount of SOC at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm, and this decrease was attributed to the relative reduction of carbon source input and higher carbon decomposition. Vegetation degradation also significantly reduced the contents of SWC, DOC, MBC, LFOC, amylase and beta-glucosidase in the topsoil layers (0-10 and 10-20 cm). However, the corresponding contents in deeper soil layers had no significant differences. In addition, the SWC, DOC, LFOC and the carbon-cycle enzyme activities were higher in 2016 than in 2017. Significant correlations were obtained between SWC, SOC, LOC fractions and enzyme activities. Soil moisture was found to be the main abiotic driver for variation of soil carbon and enzyme activities. Our results indicate that vegetation degradation in the Tibetan wet meadows decreased the quantity of topsoil labile carbon fractions and enzyme activities and heavily degraded vegetation may lead to a change of profile distribution in soil carbon pool.

TI  - Assessing structural and functional indicators of soil nitrogen availability in reclaimed forest ecosystems using 15N-labelled aspen litter
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Landscape-level disturbance is a reality in many parts of the world including the Athabasca oil sands region, Canada, and soils play an essential part in the overall reclamation process. Soils are reconstructed during reclamation to provide a foundation and a nutrient source for the novel ecosystems. However, reclamation is often monitored through structural indicators of soil quality, which may not reflect dynamic ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling. Our objective was to determine if nutrient cycling was occurring on novel ecosystems and if standard structural measures of soil quality were appropriate indicators. We assessed soil quality and nitrogen cycling in reclaimed, harvested and undisturbed aspen forest sites following the addition of N-15-labelled aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) leaf litter to the soil surface. Structural soil quality indicators, including soil moisture and microbial carbon and nitrogen biomass, were higher on the undisturbed site, whereas soil microbial composition differed among sites. Yet, uptake of N-15 by microbes and plants, which continued throughout the 52 mo field incubation, was comparable across all sites. These results indicate that differences in structural attributes between disturbed and undisturbed soils do not necessarily translate into differences in soil functioning related to nitrogen cycling. Instead, this case study supports exploring the use of stable isotope tracers to assess dynamic soil function indicators in reclaimed ecosystems. Being able to follow biogeochemical cycling as vegetation becomes established and new forests start to develop following reclamation is key to assessing the long-term sustainability of these novel ecosystems.

TI  - Unlocking soil health: Are microbial functional genes effective indicators?
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil microbial community plays crucial roles in promoting soil functions and maintaining soil health. Microbial functional gene abundances are actively involved in soil processes which supports soil functions and wider soil health. However, their suitability as indicators to assess soil health is still debatable. In this study, we sampled soils from a 10-year long-term fertilization experiment in a wheat-maize cropping system on the North China Plain. The treatment included no fertilizer (Control), chemical fertilizers only (NPK), NPK + organic manure, NPK + straw, and NPK + manure + straw. We quantified seventeen functional genes involved in carbon (cbbL, GH31), nitrogen (nifH, ureC, chiA, A-amoA, B-amoA, narG, nirK, nirS, norB and nosZ), and phosphorus (gltA, bpp, phoD, phoC, pqqC) cycling. These genes were correlated with a suite of soil properties representing indicators of carbon (total carbon, organic carbon, and permanganate oxidizable carbon, alpha-1,4 glucosidase and carbon dioxide emission), nitrogen (total nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, and nitrous oxide emission), and phosphorous (available phosphorus, acid and alkaline phosphatase) pools/cycling. Soil microbial functional genes exhibited high coefficients of variation and strong sensitivity to fertilization treatments, while showing low variability among replicates within the same treatment. The abundances of functional genes, especially GH31, cbbL, B-amoA, chiA, phoC, and phoD were strongly correlated with their proxy indicators of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. In addition, organic fertilization enhanced carbon and nutrients relevant functional gene abundances, generating positive effects on maize yield. These results indicate that microbial functional genes are sensitive to organic inputs and could provide a more detailed and mechanistic understanding of soil processes than conventional indicators by capturing the biochemical processes that govern nutrient dynamics. Our study underscores the potential of microbial functional genes as sensitive and valuable indicators for advancing soil health assessments and management practices.

TI  - Soil CO2 in organic and no-till agroecosystems
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in soil profiles could increase carbon sequestration via improved residence times of soil organic carbon (SOC), greater nutrient availability and plant growth, and via other pathways, but the effect of agricultural management techniques on soil CO2 is poorly understood. We used nondispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors to measure gas-phase CO2 concentrations in 1.50 m soil profiles in paired no-till (NT) and organic (ORG) agricultural systems in the Palouse region of eastern Washington State, USA, to investigate the effect of management on soil CO2. CO2 concentrations were significantly greater in ORG than in NT. The CO2 efflux into the atmosphere estimated using Fick's first law was generally greater in ORG due to both greater diffusivity and stronger concentration gradients observed in ORG. Results demonstrate that organic agriculture may facilitate greater soil CO2 concentrations and production rates. Further research is needed to quantify and understand the role of increased CO2 in soil carbon cycling in agroecosystems.

TI  - Biotic interactions mediate soil microbial feedbacks to climate change
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Decomposition of organic material by soil microbes generates an annual global release of 50-75 Pg carbon to the atmosphere, similar to 7.5-9 times that of anthropogenic emissions worldwide. This process is sensitive to global change factors, which can drive carbon cycle-climate feedbacks with the potential to enhance atmospheric warming. Although the effects of interacting global change factors on soil microbial activity have been a widespread ecological focus, the regulatory effects of interspecific interactions are rarely considered in climate feedback studies. We explore the potential of soil animals to mediate microbial responses to warming and nitrogen enrichment within a long-term, field-based global change study. The combination of global change factors alleviated the bottom-up limitations on fungal growth, stimulating enzyme production and decomposition rates in the absence of soil animals. However, increased fungal biomass also stimulated consumption rates by soil invertebrates, restoring microbial process rates to levels observed under ambient conditions. Our results support the contemporary theory that top-down control in soil food webs is apparent only in the absence of bottom-up limitation. As such, when global change factors alleviate the bottom-up limitations on microbial activity, top-down control becomes an increasingly important regulatory force with the capacity to dampen the strength of positive carbon cycle-climate feedbacks.

TI  - Prescribed biomass burning effects on soil NO emissions in South Carolina
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) are key atmospheric trace gases that affect air quality, oxidation chemistry, and nitrogen deposition. Although anthropogenic NOx emissions have declined due to regulations, natural sources like soil emissions are becoming relatively more important. Biomass burning can alter soil nitrogen cycling and potentially influence soil NO fluxes, yet few controlled studies exist. Here, we examined how prescribed burning affects soil NO emissions in a South Carolina forest using incubation experiments. The study site is a sandhill ecosystem dominated by upland oak and longleaf pine, with fire-adapted understory vegetation including wiregrass. Soil cores were collected before and after burns of varying intensities. Measured soil pH, nitrate, and ammonium showed no consistent differences between pre- and post-burn conditions. NO fluxes, quantified using a custom soil chamber, averaged 0.056 +/- 0.068 ng-N h-1 g-1 with no significant burn-related change, and most values remained below the method detection limit of 0.137 ng-N h-1 g-1. However, ammonium nitrate additions triggered significant NO emissions, highlighting nitrogen availability as a key control. Scaling fluxes to the state level, we estimate natural forest soil contributed an estimated 700 +/- 800 metric tons of NO during a summer month, which is about 5.0 +/- 6.0% of statewide NO emissions. These results suggest that prescribed fire does not enhance soil NO emissions in nitrogen-limited, acidic southeastern U.S. forests, immediately following fire events. Moreover, they indicate that forest soil emissions are likely a minor contributor to regional NO budgets in this region.

TI  - Microbial stoichiometry overrides biomass as a regulator of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the role of soil microbial communities in coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles has become an area of great interest as we strive to understand how global change will influence ecosystem function. In this endeavor, microbially explicit decomposition models are being adopted because they include microbial stoichiometry-and biomass-mediated mechanisms that may be important in shaping ecosystem response to environmental change. Yet there has been a dearth of empirical tests to verify the predictions of these models and hence identify potential improvements. We measured the response of soil microbes to multiple rates of carbon and nitrogen amendment in experimental microcosms, and used the respiration and nitrogen mineralization responses to assess a well-established, single-pool, microbial decomposition model. The model generally predicted the empirical trends in carbon and nitrogen fluxes, but failed to predict the empirical trends in microbial biomass. Further examination of this discontinuity indicated that the model successfully predicted carbon and nitrogen cycling because stoichiometry overrode microbial biomass as a regulator of cycling rates. Stoichiometric control meant that the addition of carbon generally increased respiration and decreased nitrogen mineralization, whereas nitrogen had the opposite effects. Biomass only assumed importance as a control on cycling rates when stoichiometric ratios of resource inputs were a close match to those of the microbial biomass. Our work highlights the need to advance our understanding of the stoichiometric demands of microbial biomass in order to better understand biogeochemical cycles in the face of changing organic-and inorganic-matter inputs to terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Sorption, degradation and microbial toxicity of chemicals associated with hydraulic fracturing fluid and produced water in soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Spills of hydraulic fracturing (HF) fluids and of produced water during unconventional gas extraction operations may cause soil contamination. We studied the degradation and microbial toxicity of selected HF chemical components including two biocides (methylisothiozolinone-MIT, chloromethylisothiozolinone-CMIT), a gel -breaker aid (triethanolamine-TEA), and three geogenic chemicals (phenol, m -cresol and p -cresol) in ultrapure water, HF fluid and produced water in five different soil types (surface and subsurface soils). The degradation of the two biocides (in soils treated with HF fluid or ultrapure water) and of the three geogenic chemicals (in soils treated with produced water) was rapid (in all cases DT50 values < 2 days in surface soils). In contrast, the loss of TEA was much slower in soils, especially in those treated with HF fluid (DT50 > 30 days). Sorption coefficients (K-oc in L/Kg) in these soils ranged from 71 to 733 for TEA, 64-408 for MIT and 11-72 for CMIT. In terms of soil microbial toxicity, exposure to HF fluid and produced water reduced microbial respiration, albeit temporarily. The overall microbial activities in surface soils contaminated with produced water had fully recovered in most soils. In contrast, the HF fluid addition to soils completely inhibited the nitrification in all soils, with little re-covery over the 60 day experimental period. In the case of produced water exposure, three out of five surface soils showed complete recovery in nitrification during the study period. The functional genes for nitrogen fix-ation (nifH) and carbon cycling (GA1) and microbial community composition (16 S rRNA) were significantly affected by HF fluid in some soils. Overall, the study shows that the HF fluid can have significant detrimental impact on soil microbial functions, especially on nitrogen cycling. More work is needed to identify the exact cause of microbial toxicity in soils contaminated with HF fluid.

TI  - Different Cropping Patterns to Restore Saline-Alkali Soils in Northeast China Affect the Abundance of Functional Genes in the Soil Nitrogen Cycle
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Considerable attention has been paid to the establishment of an appropriate cropping patterns for the restoration of saline-alkali lands. This study's goal was to explore changes in nitrogen-cycling (N-cycling) gene (nitrogen fixation: nifH; nitrification: AOA, AOB, and nxrB; denitrification: narG, norB, and nosZ) abundance of three cropping patterns at two soil depths in saline-alkali soils. Results showed that rotation and mixture promoted soil nutrients. N-cycling functional genes were significantly influenced by soil depths and cropping patterns. Compared with monoculture, rotation decreased the abundance of nifH, AOA, narG, and nosZ and increased the abundance of AOB; mixture decreased the abundance of AOA, narG, and nosZ and increased the abundance of AOB and nxrB in the 0-15 cm soil depth. Rotation increased all genes abundance; mixture increased nosZ abundance and decreased nxrB abundance in 15-30 cm soil depth. Soil protease, cellulase, nitrate reductase, pH, AK (available potassium), and AP (available phosphorus) were important factors influencing N-cycling gene abundance. In conclusion, rotation and mixture not only reduced soil salinity but also improved soil fertility and nitrogen cycling. These findings can provide some theories for the sustainable development of N-cycling during the restoration of saline-alkali soils.

TI  - The Effects of Stand Density Control on Carbon Cycle in Chamaecyparis obtusa (Siebold and Zucc.) Endl. Forests
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - This study was conducted to quantify the carbon storage in each pool (including trees, forest floor, and soil) and to analyze the carbon cycle in a Chamaecyparis obtusa (Siebold and Zucc.) Endl. forest according to different thinning intensities. The study site was located in Gochang-gun, Jeollabuk-do, and the treatments consisted of a control (Con), a light thinning (LT), and a heavy thinning (HT), based on 3000 trees originally planted per hectare. As stand density decreased, total C storage decreased, and the annual C storage of trees and C released through soil respiration significantly increased. Net ecosystem production (NEP; Mg center dot C center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1)), as the difference between net primary production and microbial respiration, was 1.95, 2.49, and 2.11 in the Con, LT, and HT treatments, respectively; i.e., the LT stimulated greater NEP than the Con and HT treatments. While these results show that thinning decreases total C storage of forests, proper thinning enhances carbon uptake capacity. In addition, this study can be a basic reference for the effects of thinning on forest carbon cycles. Repeated measurements of each C pool should be performed over multiple years to see the exact movement patterns of forest carbon in the future.

TI  - Nitrogen cycling in poplar stands defoliated by insects
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Large-scale outbreaks of defoliating insects are common in temperate forests. These outbreaks are thought to be responsible for substantial cycling of nitrogen (N), and its loss from the system. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) populations within poplar plots were manipulated over 2 years so that the ecosystem-wide consequences of catastrophic defoliation on N cycling could be examined. The quantities of N in leaf litter-fall, ammonia volatilization and soil N pools were estimated across the two seasons. Defoliated leaf biomass was estimated from experimentally derived approximate digestibility factors and added to the mass of senesced leaf to determine total annual leaf production. Throughout the growing season the defoliation treatment peaked at about 40% in year 1 and 100% in year 2. Rapid regrowth after defoliation meant that only 45% of the annual leaf biomass was consumed in the defoliation treatment in year 2, while control plots suffered about 20% consumption each year. In each year, defoliated plots produced 20% more leaf biomass and N than the controls, a phenomenon attributed to compensatory photosynthesis. No substantial losses of N via ammonia volatilization, nitrous oxide emission or nitrate leaching were observed. Neither was there any sustained or substantial gain in the soils microbial biomass or inorganic N pools. These observations suggest that the defoliated poplars were able to compete with soil microbes and N loss mechanisms for soil N as it became available, thereby ameliorating the effects of defoliation on soil nitrogen cycling. We conclude from this study that the N mineralized from defoliation residues was conserved in this plantation ecosystem.

TI  - Higher Trophic Levels Overwhelm Climate Change Impacts on Terrestrial Ecosystem Functioning
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Forest floor food webs play pivotal roles in carbon cycling, but they are rarely considered in models of carbon fluxes, including soil carbon dioxide emissions (respiration), under climatic warming. The indirect effects of invertebrates on heterotrophic (microbial and invertebrate) respiration through interactions with microbial communities are significant and will be altered by warming. However, the interactive effects of invertebrates and warming on heterotrophic respiration in the field are poorly understood. In this study we combined field and common garden laboratory approaches to examine relationships between warming, forest floor food web structure, and heterotrophic respiration. We found that soil animals can overwhelm the effects of warming (to 5 degrees Celsius above ambient) on heterotrophic respiration. In particular, the presence of higher trophic levels and burrowing detritivores strongly determined heterotrophic respiration rates in temperate forest soils. These effects were, however, context-dependent, with greater effects in a lower-latitude site. Without isolating and including the significant impact of invertebrates, climate models will be incomplete, hindering well-informed policy decisions.

TI  - Soil temperature and fungal diversity jointly modulate soil heterotrophic respiration under short-term warming in the Zoige alpine peatland
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Global warming has changed carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, but it remains unclear how climate warming affects soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh). We conducted a field experiment in the Zoige alpine peatland to investigate the mechanism of how short-term warming affects Rh by examining the relationships between plant biomass, soil properties, soil microbial diversity, and functional groups and Rh. Our results showed that warming increased Rh after one growing season of warming. However, warming barely changed the bacterial functional groups involved in the carbon cycle predicted by the functional annotation analysis. According to the Mantel test, NO3- was found to be the primary determinant for bacterial and fungal communities. The results of the Structural Equation Model (SEM) indicate that soil temperature and fungal diversity jointly modulate Rh, suggesting that short-term warming may not affect Rh by altering the structural and functional composition of microorganisms, which provides new insight into the mechanisms of the effects of warming on Rh in terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Diversity and ecology of oxalotrophic bacteria
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Oxalate is present in environments as diverse as soils or gastrointestinal tracts. This organic acid can be found as free acid or forming metal salts (e.g. calcium, magnesium). Oxalotrophy, the ability to use oxalate as carbon and energy sources, is mainly the result of bacterial catabolism, which can be either aerobic or anaerobic. Although some oxalotrophic bacterial strains are commonly used as probiotics, little is known about the diversity and ecology of this functional group. This review aims at exploring the taxonomic distribution and the phylogenetic diversity of oxalotrophic bacteria across biomes. In silico analyses were conducted using the two key enzymes involved in oxalotrophy: formyl-coenzyme A (CoA) transferase (EC 2.8.3.16) and oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.8), encoded by the frc and oxc genes, respectively. Our analyses revealed that oxalate-degrading bacteria are restricted to three phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and originated from terrestrial, aquatic and clinical environments. Diversity analyses at the protein level suggest that total Oxc diversity is more constrained than Frc diversity and that bacterial oxalotrophic diversity is not yet fully described. Finally, the contribution of oxalotrophic bacteria to ecosystem functioning as well as to the carbon cycle is discussed.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of soil microbial C and N cycles with GHG fluxes in the transition from tropical peatland forest to oil palm plantation
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Tropical peatlands significantlyinfluence local and global carbon and nitrogen cycles, yet they face growing pressure from anthropogenic activities. Land use changes, such as peatland forests conversion to oil palm plantations, affect the soil microbiome and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the temporal dynamics of microbial community changes and their role as GHG indicators are not well understood. This study examines the dynamics of peat chemistry, soil microbial communities, and GHG emissions from 2016 to 2020 in a logged-over secondary peat swamp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia, which transitioned to an oil palm plantation. This study focuses on changes in genetic composition governing plant litter degradation, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. Soil CO2 emission increased (doubling from approximately 200 mg C m(-2) h(-1)), while CH(4 )emissions decreased (from 200 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) to slightly negative) following land use changes. The N2O emissions in the oil palm plantation reached approximately 1,510 mu g N m(-2) h(-1), significantly higher than previous land uses. The CH(4 )fluxes were driven by groundwater table, humification levels, and C:N ratio, with Methanomicrobia populations dominating methanogenesis and Methylocystis as the main CH4 oxidizer. The N2O fluxes correlated with groundwater table, total nitrogen, and C:N ratio with dominant nirK-type denitrifiers (13-fold nir to nosZ) and a minor role by nitrification (a threefold increase in amoA) in the plantation. Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria encoding incomplete denitrification genes potentially impact N2O emissions. These findings highlighted complex interactions between microbial communities and environmental factors influencing GHG fluxes in altered tropical peatland ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Tropical peatlands are carbon-rich environments that release significantamounts of greenhouse gases when drained or disturbed. This study assesses the impact of land use change on a secondary tropical peat swamp forest site converted into an oil palm plantation. The transformation lowered groundwater levels and changed soil properties. Consequently, the oil palm plantation site released higher carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide compared to previous land uses. As microbial communities play crucial roles in carbon and nitrogen cycles, this study identified environmental factors associated with microbial diversity, including genes and specific microbial groups related to nitrous oxide and methane emissions. Understanding the factors driving microbial composition shifts and greenhouse gas emissions in tropical peatlands provides baseline information to potentially mitigate environmental consequences of land use change, leading to a broader impact on climate change mitigation efforts and proper land management practices.

TI  - Ectomycorrhizal Stands Accelerate Decomposition to a Greater Extent than Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Stands in a Northern Deciduous Forest
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - It has been proposed that ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi slow down decomposition by competing with free-living saprotrophs for organic nutrients and other soil resources (known as the "Gadgil effect''), thereby increasing soil carbon sequestration. As such, this Gadgil effect should depend on soil organic matter age and quality, but this remains unstudied. In addition, the Gadgil effect is not expected to occur in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) forests since AM fungi cannot access directly nutrients from soil organic matter, yet few direct comparisons between EcM and AM forests have been made. We performed a two-year reciprocal decomposition experiment of soil organic horizons (litter-L, fragmented-F, humic-H) in adjacent temperate deciduous forests dominated by EcM or AM trees. Mesh bags were made of different mesh sizes allowing or excluding ingrowth of external fungal hyphae, which are primarily mycorrhizal in these forests other than for the most recent superficial litter horizon. As expected, EcM stands stored more soil carbon (up to 20 cm depth) than AM stands. Also, organic matter originating from deeper horizons and from EcM stands was of lower quality (for example, higher lignin to nitrogen ratios) and decomposed more slowly. However, contrary to the Gadgil effect, organic matter exposed to external fungal hyphae (that is, primarily mycorrhizal) actually decomposed faster in both forest types, and this effect was strongest in EcM forests, particularly in the F horizon. Unexpectedly, organic matter decomposition was faster in EcM than in AM forests, regardless of organic matter origin. Overall, our study reinforces the view that temperate EcM forests store greater amounts of soil organic carbon than AM forests, but suggests that this is due to factors other than the Gadgil effect.

TI  - Short-term carbon cycling at a Sphagnum farming site under drought stress
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Paludiculture is a new land use option for degraded peatlands, producing biomass under wet and peat preserving conditions. While previous studies indicate a significant greenhouse gas mitigation potential, the impact of bryophyte and vascular plant species on carbon cycling is not yet fully understood, especially under drought stress and climate warming conditions. In July 2018, we conducted a pulse labelling experiment at a Sphagnum farming area in Northwestern Germany to trace sequestered carbon dioxide (13CO2) in above-ground biomasses of peat mosses (Sphagnum) and dominant vascular plant species purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea), soil microbial biomass (Cmic), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as dissolved and emitted CO2 and methane under drought stress induced by summer drought and simulated climate warming using Open Top Chambers (OTCs). We observed fast label allocation to all investigated carbon pools with the exception of DOC. Although label uptake was clearly higher in Molinia compared to Sphagnum, most carbon was lost via respiration within a few days and the percentage of stored carbon after 140 days was clearly higher in Sphagnum and Cmic. Differences between warmed and control plots were small, presumably due to the already hot and dry conditions. Our results highlight that carbon uptake and storage processes are maintained even under extreme drought conditions, while further experimental warming using OTCs was less influential. The presented findings confirm the important role of Sphagnum in carbon retention and the risk of methane emissions even at low water levels via plant-mediated transport. Consequently, an elaborate irrigation management and control of vascular plants are the key to successful Sphagnum farming and GHG mitigation.

TI  - Effects of rice straw biochar application rates on soil aggregate biogeochemistry and linkages to microbial community structure and enzyme activities
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Biochar, a widely adopted soil amendment, has been widely recognized for its potential to improve crop yields and soil nutrients significantly. This enhancement is primarily attributed to the crucial role of soil microorganisms, whose contribution to soil fertility is significant and often underappreciated. However, the effects of varying biochar application rates on soil functional biota, particularly within aggregates that expand soil spatial heterogeneity, remain unclear. Understanding the relationship between nutrient dynamics and microbial community composition in these aggregates is essential for comprehending the intricate connections between soil microbiomes and related biogeochemical cycles. This study utilized long-term experimental soils, including treatments with no fertilizer, chemical fertilizer alone, and chemical fertilizer combined with rice straw biochar at gradient application rates (22.5, 45, 90 t center dot hm 2). The responses of microbial community structure and soil enzyme activities in whole soil and aggregates to different biochar application rates were investigated. Results showed that, compared to NPK treatment, biochar significantly increased bacterial and fungal diversity in macroaggregates. It also notably increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Ascomycota in soil and aggregates, and at the same time reduced the relative abundance of Chloroflexi and Basidiomycota. Furthermore, carbon and phosphorus cycle-related enzyme activities increased significantly with higher biochar application rates. However, the activity of NAG, a nitrogen cycle-related enzyme, decreased as biochar application increased. Mantel analysis revealed that the relationship between microorganisms, enzyme activity, and soil nutrients was closest at a biochar application rate of 45 t center dot hm 2. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that macroaggregates exhibited the most complex nutrient accumulation relationships, with bacterial and fungal diversity promoting nutrient accumulation. In conclusion, moderate biochar application induced the most intricate and closely connected microbial networks in macroaggregates, promoting soil nutrient cycling.

TI  - Disturbance can slow down litter decomposition, depending on severity of disturbance and season: an example from Mount Kilimanjaro
T2  - WEB ECOLOGY
AB  - Deforestation and land-use change affect ecosystem processes such as carbon cycling. Here, we present results from a litter decomposition experiment in six natural and six disturbed vegetation types along an elevation gradient of 3600 m on the southern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. We exposed litter bags with a standard material for up to 12 weeks each in two seasons. In the cold wet season we sampled the full elevation gradient and in the warm wet season we repeated the sampling in the lower part of the elevation gradient. Though we found significantly negative effects of disturbance in forest ecosystems, this was only due to differences between natural and burned Podocarpus forests. Disturbance characterized by a more open vegetation structure in many of the studied vegetation types had no general effect when we studied the full elevation gradient; this also included non-forest vegetation types. Land-use intensity had a significant negative effect on decomposition rates but only in the warm wet season, not in the cold wet season. Temperature and humidity were the most important drivers of decomposition overall and for all subsets of vegetation types and seasons. Our study shows that negative effects of disturbance or land-use intensity on decomposition depended on the severity of disturbance and on the season. Nevertheless, climate was generally the most relevant driver of decomposition. Therefore, vegetation types with moderate levels of disturbance can retain high functionality in regards to carbon cycling over short periods of time. More and longer decomposition studies are necessary to better predict consequences of land-use change for carbon cycling in the Afrotropics.

TI  - Structural, metabolic, and functional characteristics of soil microbial communities in response to benzo[a]pyrene stress
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - Understanding the characteristics of soil microbes responding to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) helps to deepen the knowledge of the risks of BaP to soil ecosystem. In this study, the structural, metabolic, and functional responses of soil microbial communities to BaP (8.11 mg kg(-1)) were investigated. Analysis of microbial community structure based on 16 S rRNA and ITS gene sequencing indicated that BaP addition enriched microbes associated with aromatic compound degradation (Sphingomonas, Bacilli, Fusarium) and oligotrophs (Blastocatellaceae, Rokubacteriales), but inhibited Cyanobacteria involved in nitrogen-fixing process. Network analysis showed that the bacterial community enhanced intraspecific cooperation, while fungal community mainly altered the keystone taxa under BaP stress. Biolog EcoPlate assay demonstrated that microbial metabolism of carbon sources, especially nitrogen-containing sources, was stimulated by BaP addition. Functional analysis based on enzyme activity tests, functional gene quantification, and function annotation showed that nitrogen-cycling processes, especially nitrogen fixation, were significantly inhibited. These results suggest that BaP-tolerant microbes may establish cooperative relationships and compete for resources and ecological niches with sensitive microbes, especially those associated with nitrogen cycling, ultimately leading to enhanced carbon source utilization and restricted nitrogen cycling. This study clearly elucidates the adaptation strategies and functional shifts of soil microbial communities to BaP contamination.

TI  - Microbial respiratory thermal adaptation is regulated by r-/K-strategy dominance
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Microbial thermal adaptation is considered to be one of the core mechanisms affecting soil carbon cycling. However, the role of microbial community composition in controlling thermal adaptation is poorly understood. Using microbial communities from the rhizosphere and bulk soils in an 8-year warming experiment as a model, we experimentally demonstrate that respiratory thermal adaptation was much stronger in microbial K-strategist-dominated bulk soils than in microbial r-strategist-dominated rhizosphere soils. Soil carbon availability exerted strong selection on the dominant ecological strategy of the microbial community, indirectly influencing respiratory thermal adaptation. Our findings shed light on the linchpin of the dominant ecological strategy exhibited by the microbial community in determining its respiratory thermal adaptation, with implications for understanding soil carbon losses under warming.

TI  - Taxonomic and functional restoration of tallgrass prairie soil microbial communities in comparison to remnant and agricultural soils
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Restoring ecosystems requires the re-establishment of diverse soil microbial communities that drive critical ecosystem functions. In grasslands, restoration and management require the application of disturbances like fire and grazing. Disturbances can shape microbial taxonomic composition and potentially functional composition as well. We characterized taxonomic and functional gene composition of soil communities using whole genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing to determine how restored soil communities differed from pre-restoration agricultural soils and original remnant soils, how management affects soil microbes, and whether restoration and management affect the number of microbial genes associated with carbohydrate degradation. We found distinct differences in both taxonomic and functional diversity and composition among restored, remnant, and agricultural soils. Remnant soils had low taxonomic and functional richness and diversity, as well as distinct composition, indicating that restoration of agricultural soils does not re-create soil microbial communities that match remnants. Prescribed fire management increased functional diversity, which also was higher in more recently planted restorations. Finally, restored and post-fire soils included high abundances of genes encoding cellulose-degrading enzymes, so restorations and their ongoing management can potentially support functions important in carbon cycling.
   Restored prairie soils contain taxonomically and functionally diverse microbial communities that are distinct from pre-restoration agricultural soils but do not match the composition of original, unplowed prairie remnants.

TI  - The Community Structure of eDNA in the Los Angeles River Reveals an Altered Nitrogen Cycle at Impervious Sites
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - In this study, we sought to investigate the impact of urbanization, the presence of concrete river bottoms, and nutrient pollution on microbial communities along the L.A. River. Six molecular markers were evaluated for the identification of bacteria, plants, fungi, fish, and invertebrates in 90 samples. PCA (principal components analysis) was used along with PAM (partitioning around medoids) clustering to reveal community structure, and an NB (negative binomial) model in DESeq2 was used for differential abundance analysis. PCA and factor analysis exposed the main axes of variation but were sensitive to outliers. The differential abundance of Proteobacteria was associated with soft-bottom sites, and there was an apparent balance in the abundance of bacteria responsible for nitrogen cycling. Nitrogen cycling was explained via ammonia-oxidizing archaea; the complete ammonia oxidizers, Nitrospira sp.; nitrate-reducing bacteria, Marmoricola sp.; and nitrogen-fixing bacteria Devosia sp., which were differentially abundant at soft-bottom sites (p adj < 0.002). In contrast, the differential abundance of several cyanobacteria and other anoxygenic phototrophs was associated with the impervious sites, which suggested the accumulation of excess nitrogen. The soft-bottom sites tended to be represented by a differential abundance of aerobes, whereas the concrete-associated species tended to be alkaliphilic, saliniphilic, calciphilic, sulfate dependent, and anaerobic. In the Glendale Narrows, downstream from multiple water reclamation plants, there was a differential abundance of cyanobacteria and algae; however, indicator species for low nutrient environments and ammonia-abundance were also present. There was a differential abundance of ascomycetes associated with Arroyo Seco and a differential abundance of Scenedesmaceae green algae and cyanobacteria in Maywood, as seen in the analysis that compared suburban with urban river communities. The proportion of Ascomycota to Basidiomycota within the L.A. River differed from the expected proportion based on published worldwide freshwater and river 18S data; the shift in community structure was most likely associated with the extremes of urbanization. This study indicates that extreme urbanization can result in the overrepresentation of cyanobacterial species that could cause reductions in water quality and safety.

TI  - Reducing nitrogen application under water saving irrigation reduces greenhouse gas emissions by regulating the population of functional microorganisms, compatible with improving the wheat yield in the North China Plain
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsExcessive nitrogen fertilizer use reduces wheat yield and contributes to several environmental problems. The objective of this study was optimizing nitrogen fertilizer application under water-saving conditions of supplemental irrigation can balance grain yield and alleviate global warming potential value.MethodsSupplementary irrigation techniques were applied during the jointing and anthesis stages of winter wheat. The effects of four N application treatments, no N treatment, 0 (N0), 150 (N150), 210 (N210) and 270 (N270) kg ha-1, on greenhouse gas emissions, abundance of nitrification and denitrification genes, and grain yield in winter wheat fields were investigated.ResultsThe results indicated that increasing nitrogen fertilizer application significantly enhanced soil inorganic nitrogen content, nitrogen cycling microbial abundance, and greenhouse gas emissions. Over the two-year period, the global warming potential (GWP) associated with N150 and N210 decreased by 35.45%- 39.16% and 19.60%- 27.12%, respectively, compared to N270. The greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) showed no significant difference between N150 and N210 but was markedly lower than that of N270. Additionally, the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for N210 and N270 decreased by 21.72% and 42.65%, respectively, compared to N150. Across both growing seasons, the highest grain yield (GY) and nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE) were observed in N210.ConclusionsConsidering both grain yield (GY) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, nitrogen application under water-saving irrigation in the North China Plain should not exceed 210 kg ha-1 to ensure a balance between agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.

TI  - Microbial community resistance is associated with soil carbon degradation under warming condition in dryland agroecosystems
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil microorganisms play a critical role in regulating carbon cycling, particularly under the influence of climate change. Understanding the relationship between the ecological stability of belowground communities and soil carbon cycling under warming conditions is essential for predicting global soil carbon storage. In this study, we conducted a large-scale soil microcosm experiment using 25 paired maize and rice ecosystems distributed along a latitudinal gradient across China to explore how microbial communities in these two cropping systems respond differently to climate warming and how these responses affect soil carbon cycling. In maize soils, we observed that microbial diversity resistance was positively correlated with mean annual temperature (MAT). Moreover, both microbial diversity resistance and community resistance were higher at lower latitudes in maize soils. These low-latitude maize soils also exhibited greater microbial co-occurrence network stability and stronger phylogenetic conservation under warming conditions. However, these patterns were not observed in rice soils. Interestingly, in maize soils, community resistance was negatively correlated with the variation in organic carbon degradation-related functions under warming. Furthermore, the original organic carbon content in these soils was positively correlated with microbial community resistance and negatively correlated with functional variation in organic carbon degradation. Taken together, our results highlight the critical role of habitat in shaping microbial responses to warming, and suggest that soil microorganisms can regulate their metabolic processes to mitigate soil carbon loss under global change scenarios.

TI  - Decomposition of Nelumbo nucifera Litters with Three Initial Biomasses Significantly Affected the Microbial Community and Assembly in Sediment
T2  - CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The decomposition of aquatic macrophytes plays a critical role in releasing nutrients and driving biogeochemical cycles in freshwater ecosystems, processes largely mediated by microbial communities. However, the dynamics, assembly mechanisms, and ecological functions of microbial communities, particularly nitrogen-cycling microorganisms, in response to litter decomposition remain poorly understood. This study investigated the impact of Nelumbo nucifera litter decomposition on bacterial and nitrogen-cycling microbial communities, including ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria, in freshwater sediments using high-throughput sequencing. Decomposition experiments were conducted 240 days using three initial litter biomasses (15, 45, and 75 g). Results revealed that higher initial biomass and extended decomposition times increased mass loss and nutrient release, altering the physicochemical properties of both sediment and overlying water, such as pH, DO, and nutrient concentrations. These changes significantly altered microbial community dynamics, influenced assembly mechanisms and potential ecological functions. Dominant phyla, including Acidobacteriota, Bacteroidota, Chloroflexi, Myxococcota, and Firmicutes, exhibited higher relative abundances in litter-decomposed groups compared to the CK group. Stochastic processes dominated the assembly of AOB and AOA communities, while deterministic processes were more influential for nirS-type denitrifying bacteria. Functional predictions using KEGG pathways highlighted distinct microbial functional profiles associated with nitrogen cycling and carbon metabolism in response to litter decomposition. These findings emphasize the importance of considering both initial biomass and decomposition time when evaluating the effects of plant litter on microbial communities and their functional roles in nutrient cycling, providing valuable insights into the ecological impacts of macrophyte decomposition in freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - A thready affair: linking fungal diversity and community dynamics to terrestrial decomposition processes
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS
AB  - Filamentous fungi are critical to the decomposition of terrestrial organic matter and, consequently, in the global carbon cycle. In particular, their contribution to degradation of recalcitrant lignocellulose complexes has been widely studied. In this review, we focus on the functioning of terrestrial fungal decomposers and examine the factors that affect their activities and community dynamics. In relation to this, impacts of global warming and increased N deposition are discussed. We also address the contribution of fungal decomposer studies to the development of general community ecological concepts such as diversity-functioning relationships, succession, priority effects and home-field advantage. Finally, we indicate several research directions that will lead to a more complete understanding of the ecological roles of terrestrial decomposer fungi such as their importance in turnover of rhizodeposits, the consequences of interactions with other organisms and niche differentiation.

TI  - Atmospheric chemosynthesis is phylogenetically and geographically widespread and contributes significantly to carbon fixation throughout cold deserts
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Cold desert soil microbiomes thrive despite severe moisture and nutrient limitations. In Eastern Antarctic soils, bacterial primary production is supported by trace gas oxidation and the light-independent RuBisCO form IE. This study aims to determine if atmospheric chemosynthesis is widespread within Antarctic, Arctic and Tibetan cold deserts, to identify the breadth of trace gas chemosynthetic taxa and to further characterize the genetic determinants of this process. H-2 oxidation was ubiquitous, far exceeding rates reported to fulfill the maintenance needs of similarly structured edaphic microbiomes. Atmospheric chemosynthesis occurred globally, contributing significantly (p < 0.05) to carbon fixation in Antarctica and the high Arctic. Taxonomic and functional analyses were performed upon 18 cold desert metagenomes, 230 dereplicated medium-to-high-quality derived metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and an additional 24,080 publicly available genomes. Hydrogenotrophic and carboxydotrophic growth markers were widespread. RuBisCO IE was discovered to co-occur alongside trace gas oxidation enzymes in representative Chloroflexota, Firmicutes, Deinococcota and Verrucomicrobiota genomes. We identify a novel group of high-affinity [NiFe]-hydrogenases, group 1m, through phylogenetics, gene structure analysis and homology modeling, and reveal substantial genetic diversity within RuBisCO form IE (rbcL1E), and high-affinity 1h and 1l [NiFe]-hydrogenase groups. We conclude that atmospheric chemosynthesis is a globally-distributed phenomenon, extending throughout cold deserts, with significant implications for the global carbon cycle and bacterial survival within environmental reservoirs.

TI  - The abundance of nitrogen cycle genes and potential greenhouse gas fluxes depends on land use type and little on soil aggregate size
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil structure is known to influence microbial communities in soil and soil aggregates are the fundamental ecological unit of organisation that support soil functions. However, still little is known about the distribution of microbial communities and functions between soil aggregate size fractions in relation to land use. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the gene abundance of microbial communities related to the nitrogen cycle and potential greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in six soil aggregate sizes (0-0.25, 0.25-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1-2, 2-5, 5-10 mm) in four land uses (i.e. grassland, cropland, forest, young forest). Quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR) was used to investigate the abundance of bacteria, archaea and fungi, and functional guilds involved in N-fixation (nifH gene), nitrification (bacterial and archaeal amoA genes) and denitrification (narG, nirS, and nosZ genes). Land use leads to significantly different abundances for all genes analysed, with the cropland site showing the lowest abundance for all genes except amoA bacteria and archaea. In contrast, not a single land use consistently showed the highest gene abundance for all the genes investigated. Variation in gene abundance between aggregate size classes was also found, but the patterns were gene specific and without common trends across land uses. However, aggregates within the size class of 0.5-1.0 mm showed high bacterial 16S, nifH, amoA bacteria, narG, nirS and nosZ gene abundance for the two forest sites but not for fungal ITS and archaeal 16S. The potential GHG fluxes were affected by land use but the effects were far less pronounced than for microbial gene abundance, inconsistent across land use and soil aggregates. However, few differences in GHG fluxes were found between soil aggregate sizes. From this study, land use emerges as the dominant factor that explains the distribution of N functional communities and potential GHG fluxes in soils, with less pronounced and less generalized effects of aggregate size.

TI  - Comprehensive soil greenhouse gas flux dataset from a temperate old-growth forest: Effects of decade-long nitrogen addition and biological factor manipulation
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
AB  - This dataset presents greenhouse gas (CO2, CH4, N2O) flux measurements and associated environmental variables from a temperate old-growth forest (approximately 300 years old) under different nitrogen addition regimes (control, short-term 1-year, and long-term 10-year treatments) combined with biological factor manipulations (root exclusion, fungal suppression, and litter removal). Data were collected throughout the 2018 growing season (May to September) at 10-day intervals. The dataset includes measurements of three greenhouse gas fluxes, delta C-1(3) isotopic composition, soil temperature and moisture, pH, ammonium and nitrate nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and total soil carbon and nitrogen. Gas fluxes were measured using the static chamber-gas chromatography method, while soil parameters were determined using standard methods including chloroform fumigation and KCl extraction techniques. The experimental design employed a systematic factorial approach with comprehensive biological factor manipulations. These data can be utilized to analyze the long-term effects of nitrogen deposition on greenhouse gas emissions from forest soils and their biological regulatory mechanisms, providing support for research on global climate change and terrestrial carbon-nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Mycorrhizal mycelial respiration: A substantial component of soil respired CO2
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi constitute a considerable sink for plant photo-assimilates, yet poor knowledge about mycorrhizal mycelial respiration (R-Myc) hinders the quantification of its role in belowground carbon cycling. We synthesized available field data of R-Myc, and found that R-Myc contributed 15% of soil respiration and 38% of autotrophic respiration (including R-Myc and root respiration, R-Root). We observed no significant differences of R-Myc between ectomycorrhiza and arbuscular mycorrhiza dominated ecosystems. Both R-Myc/R-Root and R-Myc/(R-Root + R-Myc) significantly decreased with increasing R-Root, and correlated with absolute latitude, mean annual temperature and precipitation. Collectively, R-Myc is a substantial component of soil respiration and exhibits divergent geographical pattern with that of R-Root, and should be considered separately in terrestrial carbon cycling models.

TI  - A comprehensive review of climate warming and carbon dynamics in wetland ecosystems
T2  - DISCOVER SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Although covering only 5-8% of Earth's land surface, wetlands store 20-30% of terrestrial organic carbon, making them indispensable for achieving global carbon neutrality and sustainable development. As natural climate solutions, wetlands provide important ecological services, including carbon sequestration, water purification and biodiversity conservation. However, climate warming is altering wetlands structure and functions, particularly carbon cycling processes. These changes have profound consequences for plant growth, litter decomposition and overall carbon pools. Crucially, microbial communities, their functional traits, and carbon composition are key regulators of carbon dynamics, and the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this review, we synthesize the effects of climate warming on carbon storage and cycling in wetland ecosystems, focusing on carbon input pathways, transformation processes, and shifts in carbon pool composition. We further explore the complex interactions between rising temperatures and wetland biogeochemical processes, discussing their implications for global carbon budgets and sustainable land management. A deeper understanding of these dynamics and mechanisms is crucial for preserving wetland carbon sequestration capacity and ensuring ecological resilience in a warming climate.

TI  - How do antibiotic residues in manure affect grassland plants and soil nitrogen cycling?
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsAnimal manure is a valuable fertilizer, and its proper use is essential in circular agriculture. However, antibiotics are commonly administered to livestock and excreted in manure, thereby entering soil ecosystems. The effects of antibiotic-containing manure on soil nitrogen (N) cycling microbial guilds, plant productivity, and N turnover in grassland ecosystems remain unclear.MethodsIn a two-factorial greenhouse pot experiment, we evaluated the impact of manure with different antibiotic residues in four plant communities: grass monoculture, clover monoculture, grass-clover culture, and a no-plant control. The fertilization treatments included antibiotic-free manure, manure containing oxytetracycline, and manure containing sulfadiazine. We measured soil N-cycling functional genes, aboveground and belowground plant biomass, clover symbiotic N fixation, soil mineral N pools, N2O emissions, and antibiotic residues in plants and soil.ResultsOxytetracycline, but not sulfadiazine, significantly increased the relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and marginally increased the abundance of N-fixing microbes across all plant communities. In clover monoculture, both antibiotics reduced root biomass and root total N content. However, antibiotic residues in soil did not have significant impacts on N fixation of clover, soil mineral N pools, and soil N2O emissions.ConclusionAt environmentally relevant concentrations, oxytetracycline residues in manure-amended soils could change the soil microbial community composition, favoring more tolerant or resistant groups such as AOA. Clover exhibited greater sensitivity to antibiotic exposure than grass. Further research is necessary to understand the long-term ecological consequences of persistent antibiotics like oxytetracycline in grasslands.

TI  - Metagenomic Analysis Revealing the Impact of Water Contents on the Composition of Soil Microbial Communities and the Distribution of Major Ecological Functional Genes in Poyang Lake Wetland Soil
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China, which boasts unique hydrological conditions and rich biodiversity. In this study, metagenomics technology was used to sequence the microbial genome of soil samples S1 (sedimentary), S2 (semi-submerged), and S3 (arid) with different water content from the Poyang Lake wetland; the results indicate that the three samples have different physicochemical characteristics and their microbial community structure and functional gene distribution are also different, resulting in separate ecological functions. The abundance of typical ANME archaea Candidatus Menthanoperedens and the high abundance of mcrA in S1 mutually demonstrate prominent roles in the methane anaerobic oxidation pathway during the methane cycle. In S2, the advantageous bacterial genus Nitrospira with ammonia oxidation function is validated by a large number of nitrification functional genes (amoA, hao, nxrA), manifesting in that it plays a monumental role in nitrification in the nitrogen cycle. In S3, the dominant bacterial genus Nocardioides confirms a multitude of antibiotic resistance genes, indicating their crucial role in resistance and their emphatic research value for microbial resistance issues. The results above have preliminarily proved the role of soil microbial communities as indicators predicting wetland ecological functions, which will help to better develop plans for restoring ecological balance and addressing climate change.

TI  - Elevated CO2 impacts ectomycorrhiza-mediated forest soil carbon flow: fungal biomass production, respiration and exudation
T2  - FUNGAL ECOLOGY
CP  - Scientific Sessions on Fungi and Global Change/IMC9 Conference
AB  - Large quantities of carbon are exchanged between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, and extensive research efforts are made to understand carbon cycling and the impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. The response of soils to increased carbon availability is largely driven by root associated ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest ecosystems, since they partition host derived carbon belowground. In this review I examine how CO2 enrichment affects ectomycorrhizal fungal biomass production, exudation, respiration, soil carbon fluxes, and other soil microbes, and the importance of the fungal species in these responses. I briefly discuss the significance of CO2 alterations in the mycorrhizal symbiosis in the context of consequences for carbon sequestration, and present research priorities.

TI  - Response of the nitrogen processing bacterial community to water level fluctuation and nitrate availability in an intact marsh soil column
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Wetlands are known to experience fluctuations in water levels and receive exogenous nitrogen inputs that affect various organisms, including soil microorganisms. To study the impact of these factors on microbial diversity, we collected intact soil columns from a Phragmites australis-dominated site in the Qixing River National Nature Reserve in Northeast China. In a laboratory experiment, we simulated water level fluctuations and exogenous nitrogen inputs to the soil columns and examined the associated changes in the relative abundance of 51 bacterial genera involved in nitrogen cycling processes. Our findings revealed that different bacterial genera exhibited varying relative abundances across treatments. Specifically, Massilia showed the highest total relative abundance at the genus level, while Planctomyces had the second highest, and Campylobacter had the lowest abundance. The DESeq2 model, based on negative binomial distribution, revealed that the tags of bacterial genera were significantly correlated with soil depth, but not with water levels or nitrogen concentrations. However, the addition of a 30 mg/L nitrate solution caused a decrease in the relative abundances of bacterial genera with decreasing water levels, while a 60 mg/L concentration of nitrogen resulted in a decrease and then an increase in the relative abundances of bacterial genera with decreasing water levels. Our study provides valuable insights into the response of nitrogen-cycling bacteria to changes in different environmental conditions.

TI  - Nitrogen turnover in soil and global change
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - Nitrogen management in soils has been considered as key to the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems and a protection of major ecosystem services. However, the microorganisms driving processes like nitrification, denitrification, N-fixation and mineralization are highly influenced by changing climatic conditions, intensification of agriculture and the application of new chemicals to a so far unknown extent. In this review, the current knowledge concerning the influence of selected scenarios of global change on the abundance, diversity and activity of microorganisms involved in nitrogen turnover, notably in agricultural and grassland soils, is summarized and linked to the corresponding processes. In this context, data are presented on nitrogen-cycling processes and the corresponding microbial key players during ecosystem development and changes in functional diversity patterns during shifts in land use. Furthermore, the impact of increased temperature, carbon dioxide and changes in precipitation regimes on microbial nitrogen turnover is discussed. Finally, some examples of the effects of pesticides and antibiotics after application to soil for selected processes of nitrogen transformation are also shown.

TI  - Mammalian herbivores: ecosystem-level effects in two grassland national parks
T2  - WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN
CP  - Symposium on Ecology and Management of Ungulates in National Parks in Western North America, at the 4th Annual Meeting of the Wildlife-Society
AB  - I review studies on the effects of mammalian herbivore grazing on plant species composition, biomass, productivity, and nitrogen cycling and the responses of ungulates to grazing perturbations at 2 sites in the northern United States. Vegetation studies involved use of permanent and moveable exclosures and comparison of vegetation attributes along natural grazing gradients. Animal responses to herbivore-induced vegetation changes were monitored by direct observation and by measurement of consumption at various sites. At Wind Cave National Park (WCNP), South Dakota, heavily grazed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colonies typically had lower levels of plant biomass, were forb rather than grass dominated, and had plants with higher leaf nitrogen (N) concentrations than plants growing outside of the colonies. Soils in prairie dog colonies had greater rates of net N-mineralization than lightly grazed, uncolonized sites. Bison (Bison bison) grazed preferentially on prairie dog colonies, grassland patches mowed to simulate grazing, urine patches, and recently burned patches, presumedly because of higher forage quality in each of these patch types than on unaltered grassland. Uncolonized grasslands used by bison and other ungulates at WCNP and areas used by wild horses (Equus caballus) at Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area and the overlapping Pryer Mountain Wild Horse Range in Montana and Wyoming showed no consistent differences in plant species composition or in leaf N-concentrations compared to vegetation within exclosures. These data suggest that ungulates in these parks are managed at levels that are not presently degrading the vegetation. Although prairie dogs have had an impact on the vegetation in local areas, their colonies provide a significant portion of the food bison consume at WCNP. As long as their presence does not reduce forage availability for ungulates to a potentially critical level, further control of their populations does not appear to be warranted.

TI  - Effects of fumigation with metam-sodium on soil microbial biomass, respiration, nitrogen transformation, bacterial community diversity and genes encoding key enzymes involved in nitrogen cycling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Metam-sodium (MS) is widely used as a soil pre-plant fumigant as methyl bromide is phased out of agriculture. However, the information about how fumigation with MS affects the soil microbial community is still limited. In this study, a 66-day-long experiment was conducted to ascertain the effects of MS on soil substrate-induced respiration (SIR), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), NH4--N and NO3--N concentrations, as well as the abundance of the total bacteria and fungi and the expression of genes involved in nitrogen cycling. In addition, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to investigate the effect of MS on the soil bacterial community. The half-lives of high and low doses of methyl isothiocyanate (MITC) are 10.51 h and 9.93 h, respectively. MS caused a shortterm inhibition of SIR, MBN; had an accumulation effect on NH4+-N concentration in the short term; reduced the abundance of the total bacteria and fungi; and suppressed the expression of the nifH,AOA-amoA, anammox bacteria, nosZ, nirS, and narG. In addition, under the influence of MS, soil bacterial diversity decreased significantly in the long term, bacterial community structure was affected, and there was a shift in the predominant population; for example, some genera, such as Paenibacillus and Luteimonas, significantly increased in number. These changes in bacterial flora may be closely related to the growth of crops. Our study provides useful information for environmental safety assessments of MS in China.

TI  - Variability of ecosystem carbon source from microbial respiration is controlled by rainfall dynamics
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Soil heterotrophic respiration (R-h) represents an important component of the terrestrial carbon cycle that affects whether ecosystems function as carbon sources or sinks. Due to the complex interactions between biological and physical factors controlling microbial growth, R-h is uncertain and difficult to predict, limiting our ability to anticipate future climate trajectories. Here we analyze the global FLUXNET 2015 database aided by a probabilistic model of microbial growth to examine the ecosystem-scale dynamics of R-h and identify primary predictors of its variability. We find that the temporal variability in R-h is consistently distributed according to a Gamma distribution, with shape and scale parameters controlled only by rainfall characteristics and vegetation productivity. This distribution originates from the propagation of fast hydrologic fluctuations on the slower biological dynamics of microbial growth and is independent of biome, soil type, and microbial physiology. This finding allows us to readily provide accurate estimates of the mean R-h and its variance, as confirmed by a comparison with an independent global dataset. Our results suggest that future changes in rainfall regime and net primary productivity will significantly alter the dynamics of R-h and the global carbon budget. In regions that are becoming wetter, R-h may increase faster than net primary productivity, thereby reducing the carbon storage capacity of terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Drought limits microplastic effects on soil greenhouse gas emissions by reducing microbial diversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Extreme droughts and microplastics (MPs) accumulation in agricultural soils threaten ecosystem sustainability. We examined the impact of MPs and drought stress on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, along with the transformation patterns of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) functional genes, and microbial communities in agricultural soils. This study aims to explore how the interaction between different types of MPs and drought stress modulates soil properties, microbial dynamics, enzymatic activities, and ultimately influences soil GHG emissions. Compared to conventional polyethylene (PE) MPs, biodegradable polybutylene succinate (PBS) MPs enhanced the generation of nitrous oxide (N2O), yet drought conditions consistently suppressed overall GHG fluxes. The activities of soil enzymes associated with C, N, P, and S cycling were influenced by the type of MPs, drought, and soil properties. Notably, combined exposure to MPs and drought substantially altered soil metabolic profiles. PBS MPs under drought caused greater bacterial diversity loss and dominant taxa shifts than PE MPs. GHG emissions correlated with soil NH4+-N, pH, dissolved organic carbon, and electrical conductivity, driven by carbon degradation, methane metabolism, and phosphorus cycling functional genes. This study highlights the interplay between MPs and drought in shaping GHG emissions and nutrient cycling, offering valuable insights for the management of alternative plastic use in sustainable soil management practices.

TI  - Isotopocule analysis of biologically produced nitrous oxide in various environments
T2  - MASS SPECTROMETRY REVIEWS
AB  - Natural abundance ratios of isotopocules, molecules that have the same chemical constitution and configuration, but that only differ in isotope substitution, retain a record of a compound's origin and reactions. A method to measure isotopocule ratios of nitrous oxide (N2O) has been established by using mass analysis of molecular ions and fragment ions. The method has been applied widely to environmental samples from the atmosphere, ocean, fresh water, soils, and laboratory-simulation experiments. Results show that isotopocule ratios, particularly the N-15-site preference (difference between isotopocule ratios (NNO)-N-14-N-15-O-16/(NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-16 and (NNO)-N-15-N-14-O-16/(NNO)-N-14-N-14-O-16), have a wide range that depends on their production and consumption processes. Observational and laboratory studies of N2O related to biological processes are reviewed and discussed to elucidate complex material cycles of this trace gas, which causes global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion.

TI  - 15N in tree rings as a bio-indicator of changing nitrogen cycling in tropical forests: an evaluation at three sites using two sampling methods
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Anthropogenic nitrogen deposition is currently causing a more than twofold increase of reactive nitrogen input over large areas in the tropics. Elevated N-15 abundance (delta N-15) in the growth rings of some tropical trees has been hypothesized to reflect an increased leaching of N-15-depleted nitrate from the soil, following anthropogenic nitrogen deposition over the last decades. To find further evidence for altered nitrogen cycling in tropical forests, we measured long-term delta N-15 values in trees from Bolivia, Cameroon, and Thailand. We used two different sampling methods. In the first, wood samples were taken in a conventional way: from the pith to the bark across the stem of 28 large trees (the "radial" method). In the second, delta N-15 values were compared across a fixed diameter (the "fixed-diameter" method). We sampled 400 trees that differed widely in size, but measured delta N-15 in the stem around the same diameter (20 cm dbh) in all trees. As a result, the growth rings formed around this diameter differed in age and allowed a comparison of delta N-15 values over time with an explicit control for potential size-effects on delta N-15 values. We found a significant increase of tree-ring delta N-15 across the stem radius of large trees from Bolivia and Cameroon, but no change in tree-ring delta N-15 values over time was found in any of the study sites when controlling for tree size. This suggests that radial trends of delta N-15 values within trees reflect tree ontogeny (size development). However, for the trees from Cameroon and Thailand, a low statistical power in the fixed-diameter method prevents to conclude this with high certainty. For the trees from Bolivia, statistical power in the fixed-diameter method was high, showing that the temporal trend in tree-ring delta N-15 values in the radial method is primarily caused by tree ontogeny and unlikely by a change in nitrogen cycling. We therefore stress to account for tree size before tree-ring delta N-15 values can be properly interpreted.

TI  - Influence of Grasshopper Herbivory on Nitrogen Cycling in Northern Gulf of Mexico Black Needlerush Salt Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
AB  - Herbivory is a common process in salt marshes. However, the direct impact of marsh herbivory on nutrient cycling in this ecosystem is poorly understood. Using a N-15 enrichment mesocosm study, we quantified nitrogen (N) cycling in sediment and plants of black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) salt marshes, facilitated by litter decomposition and litter plus grasshopper feces decomposition. We found 15 times more N-15 recovery in sediment with grasshopper herbivory compared to sediment with no grasshopper herbivory. In plants, even though we found three times and a half larger N-15 recovery with grasshopper herbivory, we did not find significant differences. Thus, herbivory can enhance N cycling in black needlerush salt marshes sediments and elevate the role of these salt marshes as nutrient sinks.

TI  - Climate change impacts on organic carbon cycling in European alpine soils
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - This review focuses on impacts of climate change on soil organic carbon (SOC) cycling in alpine soils, with a specific emphasis on input and loss processes. In alpine regions, low temperatures and variable snow cover govern plant productivity and microbial activity, leading to unique SOC dynamics. However, rising temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and reduced snow cover threaten to disrupt these processes, potentially leading to significant SOC losses. Changes in vegetation, driven by climatic shifts, further complicate the dynamics of SOC by modifying the quantity and chemical composition of organic inputs into the soil. Furthermore, increased temperatures are expected to accelerate microbial activity, potentially decreasing SOC stocks and increasing carbon losses. How changing loss and input rates alter net effects of climatic changes on SOC stocks remains a persistent knowledge gap. Addressing this gap is critical for predicting carbon cycling in alpine ecosystems and formulating strategies to mitigate climate impacts. This review highlights the urgent need for targeted research on alpine SOC dynamics to better anticipate the response of these susceptible environments in the face of a rapidly changing climate.

TI  - Response of the nitrogen isotopic composition of tree-rings following tree-clearing and land-use change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Clear-cutting of forests affects the nitrogen cycle and the nitrogen isotopic composition of bioavailable ammonium and nitrate in the soil. Here, we have used nitrogen isotopic variations of tree-rings in red oak (Quercus rubra) and white oak (Quercus alba) as indicators of changes in the nitrogen cycle on a local scale. The delta N-15 values of late-wood from trees at two remnant forest stands in Ontario, Canada, that underwent large-scale tree-clearing and permanent land-use change at different times were measured. Trees from the perimeter of each stand record a marked 1.52.5%. increase in the delta N-15 values of their tree-rings relative to the values in trees from the center of the stand, with the shift synchronous with the tree-clearing and land-use change. This shift was most likely due to increased rates of nitrification and nitrate leaching in the soil as a result of tree-clearing combined with permanent Changes in hydrology and probable fertilizer use accompanying the change in land-use. Nitrogen concentration in tree-rings was not affected by tree-clearing and the associated change in land-use. These results indicate that changes in nitrogen cycling in forest ecosystems, whether due to climate change, land-use change, or other environmental changes (increased O-3, other atmospheric pollutants, insects, etc.), can be faithfully monitored with nitrogen isotopic compositions of tree-rings and that dendro-geochernical analysis can be incorporated into studies of the effects of long-term anthropogenic effects on forest ecosystems.

TI  - From plasticizers to pollutants: The ecological consequences of PAEs in agricultural soils
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Phthalate esters (PAEs), commonly employed as plasticizers, have emerged as widespread contaminants in agricultural soils. This study involved the collection of 52 representative agricultural soil samples from 13 counties and municipalities within the middle reaches of the Yangtze River to examine the distribution and ecological impacts of six priority PAEs in the agricultural soils of central China. The findings indicated that the detection rates for dimethyl phthalate (DMP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), and di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) in the soil samples were 88.46 %, 88.46 %, 82.69 %, 71.15 %, 67.31 %, and 59.62 %, respectively. DEHP exhibited the highest concentration levels, ranging from 2.99 to 991.26 mg/kg. To elucidate the ecological mechanisms underlying PAEs contamination, further investigations focused on soil properties, enzyme activities, and bacterial community characteristics. Elevated PAEs concentrations resulted in significant increases in soil total carbon (TC), organic matter (OM), and total nitrogen (TN). These concentrations stimulated enzyme activities related to carbon and nitrogen cycles while inhibiting those associated with the phosphorus cycle, thereby disrupting soil biochemical processes. Additionally, microbial diversity and abundance diminished with increasing PAEs concentrations, significantly altering the soil microbial community structure. PAEs were determined to be the primary agents influencing these changes, promoting the proliferation of PAE-tolerant taxa, including Verrucomicrobia and Clostridiaceae, while diminishing the presence of sensitive taxa. This study underscores the significant impact of PAEs contamination on the ecological dynamics of agricultural soils, manifesting in the disruption of nutrient cycling, suppression of enzyme activity, and alteration of bacterial communities. These findings emphasize the critical need for future research to concentrate on devising bioremediation strategies that utilize microbiota to degrade PAEs and restore the ecological functions of soils.

TI  - Carbon cycling in a mountain ash forest: Analysis of below ground respiration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Soils are responsible for storing up to 75% of forest carbon uptake making them extremely large carbon pools. However, soil carbon is eventually released to the atmosphere by below ground respiration, consisting of soil respiration (microbial activity) and root respiration, which is influenced by environmental climate variables (soil temperature and moisture), soil characteristics (chemical and physical properties) and stand characteristics (stand age). We investigated the impact of stand age of cool temperate mountain ash forests (E. regnans) in Wallaby Creek, Victoria on carbon cycling between the soil and atmosphere using a chronosequence of three sites of different ages (regrowth from bushfires in 1730, 1926 and 1983). Below ground respiration was measured between January (Summer) and May (Autumn) in 2005 across all three sites, with the highest rates found in the old growth forest (5.3 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) and with lowest rates in the youngest site (2.9 mu mol CO2 m(-2) S-1). Within sites, below ground respiration rates increased with temperature, with Q 10 values ranging between 1.42 and 1.55. Rates were further influenced by soil moisture, and soil physical and chemical properties, including root biomass and levels of soil carbon. Litterfall was also measured and was highest at the youngest site (140 g biomass m(-2) month(-1)) and lowest (92 g biomass m(-2) month(-1)) at the old growth site. Greater understanding of forest carbon cycling will result in an improved understanding of forests and their influence on global warming. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Nitrification and tRNA-dependent cytokinin biosynthesis by heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria enhance ryegrass regrowth
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsSoil heterotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (HAOB) play a key role in nitrogen cycling and plant growth, yet their contribution to cytokinin biosynthesis remains poorly understood.MethodsWe investigated the effects of two HAOB strains (S2_8_1 and A8) on Lolium multiflorum regrowth by conducting pot experiments, bacterial culture assays, and bioinformatics analysis. We assessed soil net nitrification, cytokinin production, and plant regrowth responses to determine the functional roles of these strains.ResultsFunctional gene analysis revealed that S2_8_1 possesses the tRNA isopentenyl transferase (MiaA) for tRNA-dependent cytokinin biosynthesis, LONELY GUY (LOG) homologs for cytokinin activation, and CYP450-mediated heterotrophic nitrification, compensating for the absence of traditional isopentenyl transferase (IPT) and ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) pathways. Pot experiments showed that S2_8_1 inoculation increased soil NO3(-)-N content by 18% and net nitrification by 21% compared to A8 by day 14. Enhanced nitrate availability stimulated cytokinin transport, leading to a 40% increase in leaf regrowth. Bacterial culture assays confirmed that S2_8_1 produced 2.53 times more cytokinins than A8, further supporting its role in cytokinin biosynthesis. This combined effect of improved nitrogen transformation and cytokinin production resulted in a 40% increase in clipped leaf biomass.ConclusionsOur findings highlight the dual role of S2_8_1 in nitrogen cycling and phytohormone regulation, suggesting potential as a microbial biofertilizer. While S2_8_1 increases NO3(-) via heterotrophic nitrification, its benefit depends on synchrony with plant uptake. When timed with crop demand, this may improve nitrogen use and reduce fertilizer input, though leaching or gas losses remain risks under poor management.

TI  - Can Sphagnum leachate chemistry explain differences in anaerobic decomposition in peatlands?
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Peatlands are important ecosystems in the global carbon cycle, serving as both the largest terrestrial soil carbon pool and a significant source of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). In Sphagnum moss-dominated wetlands, anaerobic decomposition, and in particular the production of CH4, is highly variable and controlling factors are poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to determine if leachates of Sphagnum can explain differences in anaerobic decomposition and CH4 production from three Sphagnum-dominated peatlands.
   Soils from each peatland were incubated anaerobically for 40 days with Sphagnum-derived organic matter (S-DOM) extracted using distilled water at 25 or 60 degrees C in a fully-crossed experimental design. S-DOM extracted at 25 degrees C had a minimal effect on decomposition, but S-DOM extracted at 60 degrees C increased CO2 production in all soils. The magnitude of the increased CO2 production in response to S-DOM depended on the source site of the S-DOM. The response of CH4 production to additions of S-DOM extracted at 60 degrees C was more complex. Soils from one peatland produced no CH4 during the incubation, regardless of S-DOM source. The same S-DOM additions led to an increase in CH4 production in a second soil, but a decrease in CH4 production in the third soil. Stable isotopic evidence suggests that these patterns were driven by the selective inhibition or stimulation of acetoclastic methanogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest S-DOM alone does not explain differences in anaerobic decomposition in peatlands, but may play a role in regulating CO2 and CH4 production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Effect of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) on microbial community structure and function in lake-terrestrial ecotones: A simulation experiment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
AB  - Even a low concentration of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a widely used bactericidal surfactant, can significantly change the species, quantity and genetic functions of microorganism communities in natural waters. Lake -terrestrial ecotones are areas where microorganisms are highly active, and they are also the lake areas most vulnerable to SDS pollution. Because microorganisms are very sensitive to environmental changes, their activities vary greatly among lakes and laboratories, so it is difficult to simulate their real dynamics using small-scale experiments. To study the interaction between SDS and microorganisms in a lake -terrestrial ecotone, a large artificial simulation device was used to analyse microbial community structure, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) content, gene function and ability to degrade SDS in a lake -terrestrial ecotone contaminated with SDS. The results showed that (1) the period from 2 to 4 days after the beginning of the experiment was the key stage for the biodegradation of SDS. The biodegradation cycle of SDS in the natural environment is shorter than that in small-scale experimental setups, and more than 90% of SDS was removed within 4 days in the simulation device. (2) Low-level SDS pollution ( <= 6 mg/L) has different effects on different types of lacustrine microorganisms. The presence of SDS can lead to a significant decrease in microbial diversity and biomass in lake -terrestrial ecotones with a high density of aquatic plants, but the opposite is true in ecosystems with degraded aquatic plant communities. (3) After SDS pollution occurred, pollution-resistant bacteria such as Chitinophaga and Flavobacterium became dominant. The relative abundance of carbon cycle functional genes increased rapidly in microorganisms, while the relative abundance of nitrogen cycle functional genes decreased. These changes were not readily reverse even after 20 days, although the communities recovered to a certain extent.

TI  - Forest conversion in subtropical ecosystems reduces soil microbial phosphorus potential
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Phosphorus is a critical factor limiting ecosystem productivity in subtropical ecosystems. Deforestation alters element stocks and cycling, leading to changes in the soil microbiome. However, the impacts of native forest conversion on the capacity of microbes to support phosphorus availability remain unknown. Here, we investigate the responses of soil microbial phosphorus cycling after native subtropical forests conversion to plantations and croplands across southern China. Increases in soil pH and phosphorus content after forest conversion alter microbial phosphorus cycling in plantations and croplands. Croplands have the declined functional potentials for phosphorus solubilization and mineralization, and the diversity of the key phosphorus-solubilizing bacterial taxa in Burkholderiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae is reduced. Our work highlights the importance of conserving soil phosphorus biogeochemical cycles to support the restoration of deforested environments and the sustainability of managed ecosystems.

TI  - Prolonged exposure to manure from livestock-administered antibiotics decreases ecosystem carbon-use efficiency and alters nitrogen cycling
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Microbial communities drive soil ecosystem function but are also susceptible to environmental disturbances. We investigated whether exposure to manure sourced from cattle either administered or not administered antibiotics affected microbially mediated terrestrial ecosystem function. We quantified changes in microbial community composition via amplicon sequencing, and terrestrial elemental cycling via a stable isotope pulse-chase. Exposure to manure from antibiotic-treated cattle caused: (i) changes in microbial community structure; and (ii) alterations in elemental cycling throughout the terrestrial system. This exposure caused changes in fungal : bacterial ratios, as well as changes in bacterial community structure. Additionally, exposure to manure from cattle treated with pirlimycin resulted in an approximate two-fold increase in ecosystem respiration of recently fixed-carbon, and a greater proportion of recently added nitrogen in plant and soil pools compared to the control manure. Manure from antibiotic-treated cattle therefore affects terrestrial ecosystem function via the soil microbiome, causing decreased ecosystem carbon use efficiency, and altered nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Highly consistent effects of plant litter identity and functional traits on decomposition across a latitudinal gradient
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Plant litter decomposition is a key process in terrestrial carbon cycling, yet the relative importance of various control factors remains ambiguous at a global scale. A full reciprocal litter transplant study with 16 litter species that varied widely in traits and originated from four forest sites covering a large latitudinal gradient (subarctic to tropics) showed a consistent interspecific ranking of decomposition rates. At a global scale, variation in decomposition was driven by a small subset of litter traits (water saturation capacity and concentrations of magnesium and condensed tannins). These consistent findings, that were largely independent of the varying local decomposer communities, suggest that decomposer communities show little specialisation and high metabolic flexibility in processing plant litter, irrespective of litter origin. Our results provide strong support for using trait-based approaches in modelling the global decomposition component of biosphere-atmosphere carbon fluxes.

TI  - Seasonal and ecohydrological regulation of active microbial populations involved in DOC, CO2, and CH4 fluxes in temperate rainforest soil
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - The Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (PCTR) is a global hot-spot for carbon cycling and export. Yet the influence of microorganisms on carbon cycling processes in PCTR soil is poorly characterized. We developed and tested a conceptual model of seasonal microbial carbon cycling in PCTR soil through integration of geochemistry, micro-meteorology, and eukaryotic and prokaryotic ribosomal amplicon (rRNA) sequencing from 216 soil DNA and RNA libraries. Soil moisture and pH increased during the wet season, with significant correlation to net CO2 flux in peat bog and net CH4 flux in bog forest soil. Fungal succession in these sites was characterized by the apparent turnover of Archaeorhizomycetes phylotypes accounting for 41% of ITS libraries. Anaerobic prokaryotes, including Syntrophobacteraceae and Methanomicrobia increased in rRNA libraries during the wet season. Putatively active populations of these phylotypes and their biogeochemical marker genes for sulfate and CH4 cycling, respectively, were positively correlated following rRNA and metatranscriptomic network analysis. The latter phylotype was positively correlated to CH4 fluxes (r = 0.46, p < 0.0001). Phylotype functional assignments were supported by metatranscriptomic analysis. We propose that active microbial populations respond primarily to changes in hydrology, pH, and nutrient availability. The increased microbial carbon export observed over winter may have ramifications for climate-soil feedbacks in the PCTR.

TI  - Global Nitrogen Cycle: Pre-Anthropocene Mass and Isotope Fluxes and the Effects of Human Perturbations
T2  - AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - We present a nitrogen cycle model for pre-industrial times based on an extensive literature database. The model consists of 18 reservoirs in the domains of the atmosphere, land, and ocean. The biotic reservoirs on land and in the ocean (N-fixing plants, non-N-fixing plants, and marine biota) interact with atmospheric N-2 and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN, consisting of N-2, NO3-, and NH4+) in the ocean and soil waters. Marine DIN is taken up by marine biota and transformed from ocean particulate organic matter to dissolved organic nitrogen and the ocean sediment. The atmosphere, the largest nitrogen reservoir, supplies N-2 to the system by N fixation, deposition, and dissolution, and these input fluxes are balanced by denitrification and volatilization back to the atmosphere. The land and ocean domains are linked by river transport, which carries both dissolved and particulate nitrogen to the oceanic coastal zone. The isotope-mass balances of the N reservoirs are calculated from the isotopic composition of the reservoirs and the fractionation factors accompanying the fluxes between the reservoirs based on reported values from different natural conditions. The model sensitivity was tested for different biouptake rates and was run with various human perturbations, including fertilization, nitrous oxide emissions, population-related sewage disposal, land-use changes, and temperature-dependent rate kinetics. The new N mass-isotope cycle model provides the basis for assessment of the impact of artificial fertilization between 1700 and 2050. The perturbation experiments in this study suggest that land-use change is the key factor altering the N mass cycle since industrialization.

TI  - The Impact of Aboveground Epichloe Endophytic Fungi on the Rhizosphere Microbial Functions of the Host Melica transsilvanica
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - In nature, the symbiotic relationship between plants and microorganisms is crucial for ecosystem balance and plant growth. This study investigates the impact of Epichloe endophytic fungi, which are exclusively present aboveground, on the rhizosphere microbial functions of the host Melica transsilvanica. Using metagenomic methods, we analyzed the differences in microbial functional groups and functional genes in the rhizosphere soil between symbiotic (EI) and non-symbiotic (EF) plants. The results reveal that the presence of Epichloe altered the community structure of carbon and nitrogen cycling-related microbial populations in the host's rhizosphere, significantly increasing the abundance of the genes (porA, porG, IDH1) involved in the rTCA cycle of the carbon fixation pathway, as well as the abundance of nxrAB genes related to nitrification in the nitrogen-cycling pathway. Furthermore, the presence of Epichloe reduces the enrichment of virulence factors in the host rhizosphere microbiome, while significantly increasing the accumulation of resistance genes against heavy metals such as Zn, Sb, and Pb. This study provides new insights into the interactions among endophytic fungi, host plants, and rhizosphere microorganisms, and offers potential applications for utilizing endophytic fungi resources to improve plant growth and soil health.

TI  - Effects of tetracycline on nitrogen and carbon cycling rates and microbial abundance in sediments with and without biochar amendment
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) biogeochemical processes, such as denitrification and organic matter decomposition, are critical in determining ecological functions in aquatic environments. The overuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has resulted in the ubiquitous presence of these contaminants in lakes, rivers and other water bodies worldwide. However, the effects of antibiotic residues on N and C cycling processes and associated microbial communities are not well understood. Here, 44day incubation experiments were conducted to examine the impact of tetracycline on nitrification, denitrification, and CO2 and CH4 emissions in sediments with and without biochar addition. Our results showed that tetracycline residues in sediments reached a maximum on the 5th day and then decreased gradually. Throughout incubation, there was no significant difference in sediment N and C cycling rates between control and tetracycline alone treatment. However, the tetracycline thorn biochar treatment significantly enhanced sediment denitrification rate and the emission of CO2 and CH4. The abundance of N and C cycling genes and 16s rRNA gene was significantly reduced by tetracycline exposure only on the 5th day. Furthermore, the relative abundance of several antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and class 1 integron-integrase gene (intl1) in sediments was significantly increased after tetracycline exposure. Our findings suggest that, although non-therapeutic concentrations of tetracycline seems to have no adverse effect on sediment N and C cycling rates, the residual tetracycline can reduce sediment microbial abundance in short term and may promote the proliferation of ARGs in long term.

TI  - Spatial Structuring of Cellulase Gene Abundance and Activity in Soil
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Microbial mechanisms controlling cellulose degradation in soil habitats remains a critical knowledge gap in understanding and modeling terrestrial carbon-cycling. We investigated land management and soil micro-habitat influences on soil bacterial communities and distribution of cellulose-degrading enzyme genes in three bioenergy cropping systems (corn, prairie, and fertilized prairie). Within the soil, aggregates have been examined as potential micro-habitats with specific characteristics influencing resource partitioning and regulation, thus we also investigated genes associated with cellulose degradation within soil aggregate fractions from the fertilized prairie system. Soil bacterial communities and carbon-cycling gene presence varied across land management and soil microhabitats. Examination of genes specifically involved in cellulose-degradation pathways showed high levels of redundancy across the bioenergy cropping systems, but medium macroaggregates (1,000-2,000 mu m) supported greater cellulose-degrading enzyme gene abundance than other aggregate fractions and whole soil. In medium aggregates, the enriched cellulose-degrading genes were most similar to genes previously observed in Actinobacteria. These findings represent gentic potential only, and our previous work on the same samples found elevated cellulase exo-enzyme activity in microaggregates. These contrasting results emphasize the importance of measuring community, functional genes, and metabolic potentials in a coordinated manner. Together, these data indicate that location within the soil matrix matters. Overall, our results indicate that soil aggregate environments are hot-spots that select for organisms with functional attributes like cellulose degradation, and future work should further explore micro-environmental factors that affect realized C-cycling processes.

TI  - Effects of autumn diurnal freeze-thaw cycles on soil bacteria and greenhouse gases in the permafrost regions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Understanding the impacts of diurnal freeze-thaw cycles (DFTCs) on soil microorganisms and greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for assessing soil carbon and nitrogen cycles in the alpine ecosystems. However, relevant studies in the permafrost regions in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) are still lacking. In this study, we used high-throughput pyrosequencing and static chamber-gas chromatogram to study the changes in topsoil bacteria and fluxes of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), during autumn DFTCs in the permafrost regions of the Shule River headwaters on the western part of Qilian Mountains, northeast margin of the QTP. The results showed that the bacterial communities contained a total of 35 phyla, 88 classes, 128 orders, 153 families, 176 genera, and 113 species. The dominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Gemmatimonadetes. Two DFTCs led to a trend of increasing bacterial diversity and significant changes in the relative abundance of 17 known bacteria at the family, genus, and species levels. These were predominantly influenced by soil temperature, water content, and salinity. In addition, CO2 flux significantly increased while CH4 flux distinctly decreased, and N2O flux tended to increase after two DFTCs, with soil bacteria being the primary affecting variable. This study can provide a scientific insight into the impact of climate change on biogeochemical cycles of the QTP.

TI  - Genomic evidence for the widespread presence of GH45 cellulases among soil invertebrates
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Lignocellulose is a major component of vascular plant biomass. Its decomposition is crucial for the terrestrial carbon cycle. Microorganisms are considered primary decomposers, but evidence increases that some invertebrates may also decompose lignocellulose. We investigated the taxonomic distribution and evolutionary origins of GH45 hydrolases, important enzymes for the decomposition of cellulose and hemicellulose, in a collection of soil invertebrate genomes. We found that these genes are common in springtails and oribatid mites. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that cellulase genes were acquired early in the evolutionary history of these groups. Domain architectures and predicted 3D enzyme structures indicate that these cellulases are functional. Patterns of presence and absence of these genes across different lineages prompt further investigation into their evolutionary and ecological benefits. The ubiquity of cellulase genes suggests that soil invertebrates may play a role in lignocellulose decomposition, independently or in synergy with microorganisms. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary implications might be crucial for understanding soil food webs and the carbon cycle.

TI  - Microbial functional gene patterns related to soil greenhouse gas emissions in oil contaminated areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Linking microbial community structure to physiology and ecological processes is a critical focus of microbial ecology. To understand the microbial functional gene patterns related to soil greenhouse gas [carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)] emissions under oil contamination, we used functional gene array (GeoChip 5.0) analysis and network methods to investigate the feedback responses of soil microbial functional gene patterns and identify keystone genes in Shengli Oilfield, China. The microbial functional gene number, relative abundance and diversity involved in carbon degradation and nitrogen cycling decreased consistently with the reduced CO2 and N2O flux in oil contaminated soils, whereas the gene number and relative abundance of methane-production related genes increased with contamination. Functional molecular ecological networks were built based on random matrix theory, where network structures and properties showed significantly variation between oil contaminated and uncontaminated soils (P< 0.05). Network nodes, connectivity and complexity all reduced under oil contamination. The sensitive and the highest connective genes in the network were identified as keystone genes, based on Mann-Whitney U tests and network analysis. Our findings improved the understanding of the microbe-mediated mechanisms affecting soil greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of straw and its post-pyrolysis incorporation on functional microbes and mineralization of organic carbon in yellow paddy soil
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The impact of straw and biochar on carbon mineralization and the function of carbon cycle genes in paddy soil is important for soil nutrient management and the transformation of carbon pools. This research is based on a five-year field experiment with four treatments: no fertilizer application (CK); chemical fertilizer only (NPK); straw combined with chemical fertilizer (NPKS); and biochar combined with chemical fertilizer (NPKB). By integrating indoor mineralization culture with metagenomic approaches, we analyzed the response of organic carbon mineralization and carbon cycle genes in typical paddy soil from Guizhou Province, China, to different fertilization treatments. The result shows that the various fertilization treatments significantly increased the levels of soil organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and readily oxidizable organic carbon. The NPKS treatment increased the rate of soil organic carbon mineralization, whereas the NPKB treatment decreased it. Overall, the NPK and NPKB treatments increased the relative abundance of carbon fixation genes. The NPKS treatment increased the relative abundance of carbon degradation genes. The NPKS treatment increased the abundance of Proteobacteria, whereas the NPKB treatment decreased the abundance of Actinobacteria. Biochar after straw pyrolysis can reduce carbon loss and enhance sequestration of soil carbon, whereas straw decreases soil organic carbon stability, accelerating the transformation of soil carbon pools. Future research should encompass long-term impact assessments to comprehensively understand the enduring effects of these fertilization treatments on soil carbon mineralization and the function of carbon cycle genes.

TI  - Land use effects on soil microbiome composition and traits with consequences for soil carbon cycling
T2  - ISME COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - The soil microbiome determines the fate of plant-fixed carbon. The shifts in soil properties caused by land use change leads to modifications in microbiome function, resulting in either loss or gain of soil organic carbon (SOC). Soil pH is the primary factor regulating microbiome characteristics leading to distinct pathways of microbial carbon cycling, but the underlying mechanisms remain understudied. Here, the taxa-trait relationships behind the variable fate of SOC were investigated using metaproteomics, metabarcoding, and a C-13-labeled litter decomposition experiment across two temperate sites with differing soil pH each with a paired land use intensity contrast. C-13 incorporation into microbial biomass increased with land use intensification in low-pH soil but decreased in high-pH soil, with potential impact on carbon use efficiency in opposing directions. Reduction in biosynthesis traits was due to increased abundance of proteins linked to resource acquisition and stress tolerance. These trait trade-offs were underpinned by land use intensification-induced changes in dominant taxa with distinct traits. We observed divergent pH-controlled pathways of SOC cycling. In low-pH soil, land use intensification alleviates microbial abiotic stress resulting in increased biomass production but promotes decomposition and SOC loss. In contrast, in high-pH soil, land use intensification increases microbial physiological constraints and decreases biomass production, leading to reduced necromass build-up and SOC stabilization. We demonstrate how microbial biomass production and respiration dynamics and therefore carbon use efficiency can be decoupled from SOC highlighting the need for its careful consideration in managing SOC storage for soil health and climate change mitigation.

TI  - Plant Litter Type Dictates Microbial Communities Responsible for Greenhouse Gas Production in Amended Lake Sediments
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The microbial communities of lake sediments play key roles in carbon cycling, linking lakes to their surrounding landscapes and to the global climate system as incubators of terrestrial organic matter and emitters of greenhouse gasses, respectively. Here, we amended lake sediments with three different plant leaf litters: a coniferous forest mix, deciduous forest mix, cattails (Typha latifolia) and then examined the bacterial, fungal and methanogen community profiles and abundances. Polyphenols were found to correlate with changes in the bacterial, methanogen, and fungal communities; most notably dominance of fungi over bacteria as polyphenol levels increased with higher abundance of the white rot fungi Phlebia spp. Additionally, we saw a shift in the dominant orders of fermentative bacteria with increasing polyphenol levels, and differences in the dominant methanogen groups, with high CH4 production being more strongly associated with generalist groups of methanogens found at lower polyphenol levels. Our present study provides insights into and basis for future study on how shifting upland and wetland plant communities may influence anaerobic microbial communities and processes in lake sediments, and may alter the fate of terrestrial carbon entering inland waters.

TI  - Selenium availability in tea: Unraveling the role of microbiota assembly and functions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) plants have a strong ability to accumulate selenium (Se). However, the question of how tea plants affect Se availability has received little attention. In this study, five tea cultivars, including Soubei (SB), AolU (AL), Longjing43 (LJ), Zhaori (ZR) and FenglU (FL), were chosen for the study. Quantitative Microbial Ecology Chip and high-throughput sequencing were used to explore the effects of five tea cultivars on soil functions, microbial community structures and Se availability. The results showed that the total soil Se content in the FL garden was lower compared to LJ and SB gardens, whereas available Se was highest in the FL garden. Based on the Bray-Curtis distances, tea cultivar was the main factor affecting bacterial and fungal community structures. The abundance of functional genes concerning carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur cycling processes varied among tea gardens. The higher soil NH4+ and NO3- contents, and higher abundance of functional genes like nifH, amoA1 and narG, whereas lower total nitrogen in the FL garden than in the AL and LJ tea gardens demonstrated that the FL tea plants induced microbes to accelerate soil nitrogen cycling processes. Dominant microbes that positively related with functional genes like nifH, narG, and amoA1 were also positively related with the available Se content. In conclusion, tea cultivars could regulate soil functions through affecting microbial community structures and then affecting the soil Se availability. The soil nitrogen cycle processes are suggested to be closely related with Se transformation in tea gardens.

TI  - Microbial biomass and nitrogen cycling responses to fertilization and litter removal in young northern hardwood forests
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The influence of site fertility on soil microbial biomass and activity is not well understood but is likely to be complex because of interactions with plant responses to nutrient availability. We examined the effects of long-term (8 yr) fertilization and litter removal on forest floor microbial biomass and N and C transformations to test the hypothesis that higher soil resource availability stimulates microbial activity. Microbial biomass and respiration decreased by 20-30% in response to fertilization. Microbial C averaged 3.8 mg C/g soil in fertilized, 5.8 mg C/g in control, and 5.5 mg C/g in litter removal plots. Microbial respiration was 200 mug CO2-C g(-1) d(-1) in fertilized plots, compared to 270 mug CO2-C g(-1) d(-1) in controls. Gross N mineralization and N immobilization did not differ among treatments, despite higher litter nutrient concentrations in fertilized plots and the removal of substantial quantities of C and N in litter removal plots. Net N mineralization was significantly reduced by fertilization. Gross nitrification and NO3- immobilization both were increased by fertilization. Nitrate thus became a more important part of microbial N cycling in fertilized plots even though NH4+ availability was not stimulated by fertilization.
   Soil microorganisms did not mineralize more C or N in response to fertilization and higher litter quality; instead, results suggest a difference in the physiological status of microbial biomass in fertilized plots that influenced N transformations. Respiration quotients (qCO(2), respiration per unit biomass) were higher in fertilized plots (56 mug CO2-C mg C-1 d(-1)) than control (48 mug CO2-C mg C-1 d(-1)) or litter removal (45 mug CO2-C mg C-1 d(-1)), corresponding to higher microbial growth efficiency, higher proportions of gross mineralization immobilized, and lower net N mineralization in fertilized plots. While microbial biomass is an important labile nutrient pool, patterns of microbial growth and turnover were distinct from this pool and were more important to microbial function in nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Regulation of subsurface drip fertigation on nitrogen cycling soil microorganisms and N2O and NH3 emissions from aeolian sandy soil in alfalfa field in temperate arid regions
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - Context: How to reduce the loss of reactive nitrogen (RNL), increase the nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency, and alleviate the negative impacts of nitrogen fertilization on the environment has always been the focus of scientific research. Currently, the responses of RNL and nitrogen cycling microorganisms (NCM) in aeolian sandy soil to different levels of subsurface drip fertigation and the mechanisms in temperate arid regions are still unclear. Objective: The aim was to clarify the effects of different levels of subsurface drip fertigation on the soil RNL and NCM in alfalfa fields. Methods: A two-year field experiment was conducted in Yinchuan, an arid region of northwest China, with two subsurface drip irrigation levels (525 and 700 mm) and three nitrogen application rates (0, 150, and 300 kg N ha-1). Results: The pulse emissions of N2O and NH3 significantly increased after irrigation and nitrogen fertilization. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased N2O and NH3 emissions under the two soil moisture conditions compared with the control, especially the W2N2 treatment, due to that the increase in soil NH4+-N content led to changes in the abundance of nitrogen cycling-related functional genes. The quantities of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) reflected their contributions in the ammonia oxidation, but this contribution varied depending on specific soil environmental conditions. Under low soil NH4+-N content conditions, AOA was more active than AOB and contributed more to total ammonia oxidation. Interestingly, at the high irrigation level (700 mm), nitrogen fertilization had a weaker effect on bacterial diversity than irrigation; Irrigation had a more direct and positive effect on the number and diversity of soil bacteria by increasing soil moisture content and changing soil physicochemical properties. At the high nitrogen application rate (300 kg N ha-1), AOB contributed more to the ammonia oxidation than AOA, which indirectly increased the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota, and led to greater RNL by reducing the abundance of AOA and Firmicutes. Conclusion: The irrigation and nitrogen fertilization affected the diversity and composition of bacterial communities in aeolian sandy soils, and changed N2O and NH3 emissions by changing the abundance of NCM. Significance: This study will deepen our understanding of the regulation of subsurface drip fertigation on soil microorganisms and N2O and NH3 emissions in grassland ecosystems.

TI  - Conversion of coastal marsh to aquaculture ponds altered soil ammonia oxidiser community and decreased ammonia oxidation potential
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Introduction: As a crucial component of the nitrogen cycle, ammonia oxidation in soil can be driven by canonical ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) and bacteria, as well as complete ammonia oxidiser (CMX Nitrospira). Land use change can disrupt and alter the soil microbial community and the nitrogen cycle. Materials & Methods: We compared the soil ammonia-oxidising microorganisms and ammonia oxidation potentials in a coastal marsh and nearby reclaimed aquaculture ponds, monthly over a 10-month period in southeastern China. The abundance of ammonia oxidisers was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR and the community structure of CMX Nitrospira was evaluated by high-throughput sequencing. Results: The ammonia oxidiser community was dominated by AOA in the marsh (91%) and was made up of similar proportions of AOA and CMX Nitrospira in the aquaculture ponds (46%-47%). The CMX Nitrospira community structure changed significantly between habitat types, mainly driven by opposite change in relative abundance of clade B versus clades A.2 and A.3. Aquaculture reclamation decreased the soil potential ammonia oxidation rate (PAO) by an order of magnitude, and AOA was the only significant predictor of PAO among all ammonia oxidiser groups. Conclusion: Our results suggest that aquaculture reclamation from coastal marshes would significantly alter the soil ammonia oxidiser community and decrease ammonia oxidation rate, and CMX Nitrospira appear to play a relative larger role in nitrogen cycling in aquaculture ponds.

TI  - Divergent responses of carbon and nitrogen functional genes composition to enhanced rock weathering
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) is a scalable strategy for atmospheric carbon dioxide removal. The microbiome function critically regulates the below-ground cycle of carbon and nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. However, microbial functioning related to carbon and nitrogen under ERW remains elusive. Here we investigated how wollastonite addition affects key microbial carbon and nitrogen-cycles genes investigated using metagenomic, in a tropic rubber plantation. After two-year, ERW had enhanced the alpha diversity of biogeochemical cycling genes was mainly driven by increased soil pH. ERW led to an increase in the relative abundance of carbon-fixation genes, and a decrease in the carbon-degradation genes, providing microbiological evidence for carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the relative abundance of nitrogen-cycling functional genes, and available iron increased after wollastonite addition, indicating ERW may influence nitrous oxide emissions through biological and chemical processes. Altogether, our results illustrate how the effect of ERW alters microbial functioning, impacting soil organic matter dynamics.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant diversity drive restoration of nitrogen-cycling microbial communities
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil microbial communities, key players of many crucial ecosystem functions, are susceptible to environmental disturbances, which might cause the loss of microbial diversity and functions. However, few ecological concepts and practices have been developed for rescuing stressed soil microbial communities. Here, we manipulated an experiment with or without arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculation and at three levels (one, three and six species) of plant diversity to disentangle how the AMF and vegetation rescue soil nitrogen (N) -cycling microbial loop from simulated degraded soil ecosystem. Our results showed that AMF inoculation improved the restoration of soil N-cycling microbial communities. This improved restoration was related to the role of AMF in enhancing interactions within the N-cycling microbial loop. Furthermore, increased plant diversity strengthened the role of AMF in rescuing N-cycling microbial communities. Our findings provide novel insights into the roles of AMF and plant diversity in facilitating the rescue of microbial communities in degraded terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Enzymatic activities and stable isotope patterns of ectomycorrhizal fungi in relation to phylogeny and exploration types in an afrotropical rain forest
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi obtain both mineral and simple organic nutrients from soil and transport these to plant roots. Natural abundance of stable isotopes (15N and 13C) in fruit bodies and potential enzymatic activities of ECM root tips provide insights into mineral nutrition of these mutualistic partners. By combining rDNA sequence analysis with enzymatic and stable isotope assays of root tips, we hypothesized that phylogenetic affinities of ECM fungi are more important than ECM exploration type, soil horizon and host plant in explaining the differences in mineral nutrition of trees in an African lowland rainforest. Ectomycorrhizal fungal species belonging to extraradical mycelium-rich morphotypes generally displayed the strongest potential activities of degradation enzymes, except for laccase. The signature of 15N was determined by the ECM fungal lineage, but not by the exploration type. Potential enzymatic activities of root tips were unrelated to 15N signature of ECM root tip. The lack of correlation suggests that these methods address different aspects in plant nutrient uptake. Stable isotope analysis of root tips could provide an additional indirect assessment of fungal and plant nutrition that enables enhancement of taxonomic coverage and control for soil depth and internal nitrogen cycling in fungal tissues.

TI  - The soil carbon cycle determined by GeoChip 5.0 in sugarcane and soybean intercropping systems with reduced nitrogen input in South China
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Agricultural soil is the most important carbon (C) pool on the Earth's surface and is also a source or sink of greenhouse gases. The C cycle is one of the important biogeochemical processes in the agroecosystem and requires microorganisms to participate in many of the important C cycling pathways, such as C fixation, C degradation, and methane metabolism. Insight into the functions of microbial communities in the C cycle can provide a better understanding of the response and feedback of soil microbes with respect to global climate change. The microarray GeoChip 5.0 was used in this study to detect the specific genes linking C cycling and soil microbial-mediated processes and to evaluate the abundance, diversity and similarity of the detected genes responding to different nitrogen (N) application levels under intercropping treatment. Our results indicated that compositional changes in soil microbial communities elicited by N input have functional implications for C cycling and storage in agroecosystems. We further identified a sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) field as a C sink in this intercropping system, in which sugarcane/soybean (Glycine max) (1:2) strip intercropping (SB2) at the N1 application rate (SB2-N1) had the largest C sequestration potential and net C balance among all the treatments. Most of the functional genes involved in C cycling with regards to fixation and degradation were separately identified after 4 years of N fertilization and intercropping treatments, and environmental factors were central in shaping the functional gene structure related to the C cycles. Overall, our results suggested that reduced N application combined with intercropping treatment mediates ecosystem functions and may have profound feedback effects on global climate change.

TI  - Effects of microplastics on nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and microbial communities in sediments
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Sediments are the long-term sinks of microplastics (MPs) and nutrients in freshwater ecosystems. Therefore, understanding the effect of MPs on sediment nutrients is crucial. However, few studies have discussed the effects of MPs on nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in freshwater sediments. Herein, 0.5% (w/w) polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polylactic acid (PLA), and polypropylene (PP) MPs were added to freshwater sediments to evaluate their effects on microbial communities and nitrogen and phosphorus release. The potential biochemical functions of the bacterial communities in the sediments were predicted and assessed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results showed that MPs significantly affected the microbial community composition and nutrient cycling in the sediments. PVC and PP MPs can promote microbial nitrification and nitrite oxidation, while PP can significantly promote alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the abundance of the phosphorus-regulation (phoR) gene. PLA MPs had the potential to promote the abundance of microbial phosphorus transporter (ugpB), nitrogen fixation (nifD, nifH, and nifX), and denitrification (nirS, napA, and norB) genes and inhibit nitrification, resulting in massive accumulation and release of ammonia nitrogen. Although PLA MPs inhibited the activity of ALP and the abundance of the organophosphorus mineralization (phoD) gene, it could enhance dissimilatory iron and sulfite reduction, which may promote the release of sedimentary phosphorus. Our findings may help understand the mechanisms of nitrogen and phosphorus cycles and microbial communities driven by MPs in sediments and provide a basis for future assessments of the environmental behavior of MPs in freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Microbial activity and litter decomposition under snow cover in a cool-temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Winter CO, emissions from soil and snow-covered surfaces can represent a significant fraction of the annual carbon cycle in cool-temperate broad-leaved deciduous forests. The sources of this CO2 production are, however, poorly understood. To clarify the role of saprophytic microorganisms in the carbon cycle during the winter (December-April), mass loss rates of organic substrates (leaf litter and cellulose sheets), and microbial activity and fungal biomass in the litter layer of a cool-temperate broad-leaved deciduous forest in Japan were investigated. The mass loss rate of leaves reached 13%, which accounted for 26% of the annual mass loss. Microbial respiration in the leaf litter, measured in the laboratory. was detected even at -2 degrees C. The ergosterol content (an indicator of fungal biomass) of the cellulose sheets increased significantly in the snow-covered season. Seven genera of fungi including Varicosporium elodeae, Epicoccum purpurascens and Cylindrocarpon destructans were isolated from leaf litter collected from under snow cover. Microbial respiration during the winter was estimated based on the relationships between the amount of leaf litter available, the temperature dependency of microbial respiration and the temperature in the litter layer. The 2 microorganisms in the litter layer emitted 31 gCO(2)-C m(-2), which accounts for 38% of the total CO2 efflux during the winter. These results suggest that through soil respiration, microorganisms in the litter layer play an important role in the carbon cycle during the winter. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in Alkaline Soils
T2  - SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE REVIEWS 38: CARBON SEQUESTRATION VOL. 2 MATERIALS AND CHEMICAL METHODS
AB  - Healthy soils ensure food security through sustainable agricultural production and also support in mitigating the climate change hazardous like global warming and greenhouse gases emission. However, the anthropogenic distresses of global carbon cycle cause serious risks of global warming due to the rise in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Alkaline soils occupy around one-third of the land but contain only a small quantity of soil organic carbon which is crucial in sustaining soil health and productivity. The mismanagement and misuse of alkaline soils result in soil erosion, poor soil productivity, lower water retention, weak soil biodiversity, and desertification which ultimately cause a substantial loss of soil organic carbon. These soils have pronounced capacity of carbon sequestration which requires proper management and land use practices. The adoption of conservation tillage, crop rotation, cover crops, and organic amendments can minimize soil erosion and enhance soil quality. Additionally, these practices compared with conventional operations can enhance soil quality and water retention and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The fallowing of lands must be discouraged because appropriate vegetative cover promotes carbon storage in alkaline soils.

TI  - Converting upland to paddy fields alters soil nitrogen microbial functions at different depths in black soil region
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Due to intensified land use, soil nitrogen cycling (N-cycling) and its ecological role are undergoing profound changes on a global scale. Currently, it is not clear how microbial involvement in nitrogen transformation is affected by land use conversion, including microbial diversity and environmental functions, which hinders the development of effective land management strategies. This study focused on microbial-mediated nitrogen cycling in converted black soil, transitioning from upland with maize to paddy with rice fields at two soil depths (0-15 cm and 15-30 cm). Functional gene (nifH, AOA, AOB, norB, and nosZ) abundances and critical functional groups were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Miseq sequencing. There were significant disparities in N-cycling gene abundance and microbial communities between paddy and upland fields at both soil depths, with these differences being influenced by soil properties. Notably, land use emerged as a more influential factor than soil depth in reshaping N-cycling abundance and microbial communities. Soil pH, soil moisture (SM), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3- -N) content primarily influenced variations in the N-cycling microbial community structure. The rise in ecological niche resulted in a decrease in species migration of denitrifying communities, as confirmed by estimated migration rates (M). Land use conversion induced a transition from stochastic to deterministic processes in the assembly of norB- and nosZ-harbouring communities at deeper depths, primarily governed by heterogeneous selection. This conversion led to increased diversity and network stability within the nifH-, norB-, and nosZ-harbouring communities. In upland and paddy fields, the nosZ- and nifH-harbouring communities emerged as major players in the multi-kingdom networks, respectively. These results suggest that paddy ecosystems should be regarded as suitable environments for improving soil N-cycling functions in the context of agroecosystems facing severe environmental changes.

AB  - The undulating topography of Prairie Pothole Region of North America creates spatial and temporal variability in soil moisture and nutrient levels, affecting microbial community processes and greenhouse gas emissions. By identifying differences in soil bacterial and archaeal community composition and the abundance of nitrogen cycling genes in permanent cover versus annual crop land over two growing seasons (2017 and 2018), we were able to assess the effects of topography and land use on the functional capacity of the soil microbiome. Permanent grassland cover was associated with higher bacterial diversity in upland positions and lower diversity in low-lying depressions. Bacterial community composition was also significantly different between cultivated and permanent cover at all points along the topographic slope, with the largest effects seen in the footslope and backslope positions. Compared to permanent cover, soil from annual cropland had consistently more abundant nitrifiers, including Nitrospira in the toeslope and backslope, and Nitrososphaeraceae in the shoulder and knoll samples while soils from permanent cover had a greater abundance of several Alphaproteobacteria from Rhodospirillales and Hyphomicrobiaceae across multiple upland positions. Upland soils from annual cropland also had consistently higher abundance of both bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizing (amoA) genes and a higher ratio of nirK:nirS genes compared to those from permanent cover. These differences in microbial community composition were associated with higher N2O and CO2 emissions in upland soils in annual cropland; however, there were no differences in GHG emissions between the two systems in low-lying positions.

TI  - Environmental Degradation of Cellulose Under Anaerobic Conditions
T2  - BIORESOURCES
AB  - Cellulose is a primary structural component of plants and is one of the most abundant polymers on the Earth. Degradation of this recalcitrant component of plant biomass is an important process in the global carbon cycle and can potentially provide feedstock for biofuels. Fungi and bacteria are the primary organisms able to breakdown biomass-derived cellulose. Anaerobic bacteria, present in cellulose degrading ecosystems, such as compost piles, soils rich in organic matter, aquatic sediments, and digestive systems of herbivores, have developed efficient pathways to maximize metabolic energy from biomass degradation. In the absence of terminal electron acceptors, such as oxygen, hydrogen-producing pathways are common methods of electron carrier recycling. Electron bifurcating systems linked to hydrogen metabolism play an important role in anaerobic metabolism. In this study, samples from environmental cellulose-degrading microbial communities were collected, and the metabolic products produced during anaerobic cellulose degradation were examined. Samples from different environments produced different fermentation products from cellulose, suggesting flexibility in the fermentative degradation pathways. The most abundant products observed included hydrogen, acetate, propionate, butyrate, ethanol, and methane.

TI  - Microbial processing of plant remains is co-limited by multiple nutrients in global grasslands
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Microbial processing of aggregate-unprotected organic matter inputs is key for soil fertility, long-term ecosystem carbon and nutrient sequestration and sustainable agriculture. We investigated the effects of adding multiple nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium plus nine essential macro- and micro-nutrients) on decomposition and biochemical transformation of standard plant materials buried in 21 grasslands from four continents. Addition of multiple nutrients weakly but consistently increased decomposition and biochemical transformation of plant remains during the peak-season, concurrent with changes in microbial exoenzymatic activity. Higher mean annual precipitation and lower mean annual temperature were the main climatic drivers of higher decomposition rates, while biochemical transformation of plant remains was negatively related to temperature of the wettest quarter. Nutrients enhanced decomposition most at cool, high rainfall sites, indicating that in a warmer and drier future fertilized grassland soils will have an even more limited potential for microbial processing of plant remains.

TI  - Microbial community dynamics behind major release of methane in constructed wetlands
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - It is global practice to construct wetlands in urban environments to treat pollutants from stormwater and overland runoff. However, constructed wetlands can also trigger climatic consequences by releasing a considerable amount of greenhouse gas emissions via diffusion and ebullition. While diffusive emissions are broadly measured, assessing the extent of ebullitive emissions is less common. This is due to the stochastic nature of ebullitive emissions and the complexity in their measurement. In addition, the soil microbiome community involved in greenhouse gas transport pathway has been generally understudied in Constructed wetlands although widely recognized in natural wetlands. Here we investigated diffusive and ebullitive CO2 and CH4 and ebullitive N2O emissions and the prokaryotic community from four municipal Surface Flow Constructed wetlands in southeast Australia over a 4-week period. We found that the total Global Warming Potential over a 100-year horizon of diffusive and ebullitive emissions was 0.44 kg CO2-equivalents m-2 day-1, which is 3-fold higher than the European estimates that accounted for diffusive emissions alone. Among the microbial functional groups that drove the main differences in beta-diversity, putative methanotrophs represented the 3.6%, nitrogen-cycling microbes the 44.5% and sulfate/iron cycling microbes the 13.5%, indicating that several taxa, other than methanogens, can be key in microbial dynamics, nutrient turnover and in the shift in the production of greenhouse gas thus amplifying the role of constructed wetlands as sources of CH4. We present evidence that Constructed wetlands can be major sources of greenhouse gases, particularly ebullitive CH4 that accounted for more than two-thirds of the total emissions. As such, ebullitive flux rate measurements are critical to assemble national greenhouse gas budgets, particularly from Constructed wetlands.

TI  - 3,6-dibromocarbazole have a significant effect on diversity, community and function of soil microorganisms
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AB  - In recent years, polyhalogenated carbazoles (PHCZs) have been increasingly detected in soil, potentially posing risks to soil health. 3,6-dibromocarbazole (3,6-BCZ), a representative PHCZ, is frequently found in the soil environment. However, the effects of 3,6-BCZ contamination on microbial communities remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the impact of varying concentrations of 3,6-BCZ on the soil microbiome using 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR techniques at 3, 10, 80 days (pre-, mid-, final-). alpha-Diversity analysis revealed that bacterial Shannon indices increased with 3,6-BCZ exposure (0.1 mg kg(-1) 1.45 %, 1 mg kg(-1) 4.73 %, 10 mg kg(-1) 4.45 %, 100 mg kg(-1) 5.97 %) at 80 d, compared to solvent soil group (SC). The concentration of 1, 10 and 100 mg kg-1 3,6-BCZ significantly increased bacterial diversity and altered community structure, enriching genera such as Bacillus, Adhaeribacter, and Nitrospira genera. Network analysis further demonstrated that bacterial interactions within the soil microbiome became more complex and competitive under 3,6-BCZ exposure. Additionally, functional prediction via FAPROTAX indicated significant alterations in microbial community functional groups, particularly those related to carbon and nitrogen cycling. Specifically, 3,6-BCZ promoted bacterial metabolic functions such as aerobic nitrite oxidation, nitrification, nitrogen fixation, hydrocarbon degradation, and methylotrophy, while inhibiting ureolysis and chitinolysis after 80 days of exposure. Notable changes were also observed in genes associated with nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrification (AOA-amoA and AOB-amoA), and carbon cycling (cbbLR and cbbLG). Overall, our findings suggest that PHCZs can impact soil health and microbial functionality, highlighting the need for further research to inform risk-based policy development.

TI  - Zanthoxylum bungeanum root-rot associated shifts in microbiomes of root endosphere, rhizosphere, and soil
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Root-rot disease has lead to serious reduction in yields and jeopardized the survival of the economically and ecologically important Zanthoxylum bungeanum trees cultured in Sichuan Province. In order to investigate the interaction between the microbiome and the root-rot disease, a metagenomic analysis was performed to characterize the microbial communities and functions in Z. bungeanum root endosphere, rhizosphere and bulk soil with/without root-rot disease. Soil physicochemical properties, microbial population size and enzyme activities were also analyzed for finding their interactions with the root-rot disease. As results, lower total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorus (AP) contents but higher pH in rhizosphere and bulk soil, as well as lower substrate-induced respiration (SIR) and higher protease activity in bulk soil of diseased trees were found, in comparison with that of healthy trees. Microbial diversity and community composition were changed by root-rot disease in the endosphere, but not in rhizosphere and bulk soils. The endophytic microbiome of diseased trees presented higher Proteobacteria abundance and lower abundances of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and dominant fungal phyla. The relative abundances of nitrogen cycle- and carbon cycle-related genes in endophytic microbiomes were different between the diseased and healthy trees. Based on ANOSIM and PCoA, functional profiles (KEGG and CAZy) of microbiomes in rhizosphere and bulk soil shifted significantly between the diseased and healthy trees. In addition, soil pH, TN, AP, SIR, invertase and protease were estimated as the main factors influencing the shifts of taxonomic and functional groups in microbiomes of rhizosphere and bulk soil. Conclusively, the imbalance of root and soil microbial function groups might lead to shifts in the root endosphere-rhizosphere microenvironment, which in turn resulted in Z. bungeanum root-rot.

TI  - Seasonal change and nitrogen cycling in a patchy Negev Desert: a review
T2  - ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Nitrogen cycling in the Negev Desert is concentrated in brief periods of intense microbial activity following rainfall events. In the Negev, plant litter accumulates under shrub patches during the dry period (May-October). In addition, nitrogen originating from dust deposition and snail feces, accumulates. The wetting period may be divided into two subperiods, one at the beginning of the rainy season (November-January) and the second at the end of the rainy season and beginning of spring (February-April). The accumulation of fresh plant litter in the shrub patches may be critical for preserving nitrogen for the beginning of the rainy season (34.4 g N m(-2) a(-1)). This includes the amount of nitrogen input that is intercepted by the shrub patch within the overland water runoff (0.15 g N m(-2) a(-1)), wind borne dust that is deposited on the biological soil crusts (0.09 g Nm(-2) a(-1)), N-fixation (4.32 g N m(-2) a(-1)), and annual plant litter (0.73 g N m(-2) a(-1)). The loss is by denitrification processes (2 g N m(-2) a(-1)) and ammonia volatilization (0.1 g N m(-2) a(-1)). Nitrogen that is associated with accumulated plant litter may be released as ammonia and nitrates by microbial decomposition in the spring, at the last part of the rainy season. This is ideal for optimization of the efficiency of nitrogen cycling in relation to the it-hole ecological system, since there is rapid plant growth in the Negev Desert, from February to mid April. The amount of snail feces found in the shrub patches was 20% of the total organic matter. This has been found to be the major component of the nitrogen budget (38.4 g m(-2) a(-1)). In this manner the crust patches foster the increase in productivity and diversity of the shrub patches and assist them in becoming "islands of fertility."

TI  - Utilisation of Climate-Smart Conservation Agriculture Practices for Improved Soil Carbon Sequestration, Greenhouse Gas Mitigation and Sustainable Crop Productivity
T2  - SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Intensive agriculture significantly contributes to climate change by exacerbating ecological issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, soil erosion, fertility decline, pollution and biodiversity loss. Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a pivotal role in maintaining soil health, supporting crop development and enhancing the ecological services provided by soils. Retaining SOC is essential for sustainable agriculture and mitigating climate change impacts. Factors such as soil management practices, crop types, climate conditions and soil characteristics influence agriculture's role in the global carbon cycle. Conservation agriculture (CA), a sustainable farming system emphasising minimal soil disturbance, continuous soil cover, crop residue retention and diversified crop rotations, offers a promising solution to these challenges. CA has been widely studied for its potential to improve agroecosystem resilience and mitigation capabilities. However, gaps remain in understanding its effects on crop yield and environmental quality. This study presents a comprehensive and systematic review of CA's impact on SOC, greenhouse gas fluxes, soil quality and crop productivity. Through an extensive analysis of existing literature, the review highlights that CA practices significantly enhance soil properties, including physical (e.g., soil bulk density, water retention, aggregate stability), chemical (e.g., pH, nutrient availability, C:N ratio) and biological (e.g., microbial activity, enzymatic processes) aspects. These improvements are critical for maintaining soil health and boosting agroecosystem resilience to climate change. The findings underscore CA as an effective strategy for preserving SOC, improving soil quality, reducing agriculture's environmental footprint and enhancing climate change adaptation in agricultural systems.

TI  - Differential effect of afforestation on nitrogen-fixing and denitrifying communities and potential implications for nitrogen cycling
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Denitrification and nitrogen (N) fixation are two major processes which drive N transformation in ecosystems. We investigated the effect of afforestation of pasture in New Zealand on denitrifying and N-fixing communities using molecular techniques. We optimised and applied multiplex-terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism for simultaneous analysis of denitrifying and N-fixing communities. Soil samples from four pine (Pinus radiata) forests of various age and adjacent pastures were analysed for microbial communities, denitrification rate and some environmental variables. Analysis of variance revealed that the denitrifying community was mainly influenced by site while the N-fixing community was influenced by both site and land-use types. Among environmental variables, moisture and porosity had the strongest impact on denitrifying communities while C:N ratio explained most of the variability in the N-fixing community. Denitrification rate as measured by nitrous oxide (N2O) flux, was significantly lower in older forest soils compared to adjacent pasture soils. Simple and step-wise regression analyses revealed that the N2O flux rate was strongly linked to the denitrifying community composition, providing evidence for the influence of community composition on denitrification. Moreover, we explored the relationship between denitrifying and N-fixing communities using various statistical approaches. Our results for the first time showed that denitrifying and N-fixing communities are related in situ, and suggest that changes in land-use may have a significant impact on N-transformations and ecosystem processes.

TI  - Response of Total (DNA) and Metabolically Active (RNA) Microbial Communities in Miscanthus x Giganteus Cultivated Soil to Different Nitrogen Fertilization Rates
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Miscanthus x giganteus is a promising high-yielding perennial plant to meet growing bioenergy demands; however, the degree to which the soil microbiome affects its nitrogen cycling and subsequently, biomass yield remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesize that contributions of metabolically active soil microbial membership may be underestimated with DNA-based approaches. We assessed the response of the soil microbiome to nitrogen availability in terms of both DNA and RNA soil microbial communities from the Long-term Assessment of Miscanthus Productivity and Sustainability (LAMPS) field trial. DNA and RNA were extracted from 271 samples, and 16S small subunit (SSU) rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed to characterize microbial community structure. Significant differences were observed in the resulting soil microbiomes and were best explained by the sequencing library of origin, either DNA or RNA. Similar numbers of membership were detected in DNA and RNA microbial communities, with more than 90% of membership shared. However, the profile of dominant membership within DNA and RNA differed, with varying proportions of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria and Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Only RNA microbial communities showed seasonal responses to nitrogen fertilization, and these differences were associated with nitrogen-cycling bacteria. The relative abundance of bacteria associated with nitrogen cycling was 7-fold higher in RNA than in DNA, and genes associated with denitrifying bacteria were significantly enriched in RNA, suggesting that these bacteria may be underestimated with DNA-only approaches. Our findings indicate that RNA-based SSU characterization can be a significant and complementing resource for understanding the role of soil microbiomes in bioenergy crop production.
   IMPORTANCE Miscanthus x giganteus is a promising candidate for bioeconomy cropping systems; however, it remains unclear how the soil microbiome supplies nitrogen to this low-input crop. DNA-based techniques are used to provide community characterization, but may miss important metabolically active taxa. By analyzing both DNA- and actively transcribed RNA-based microbial communities, we found that nitrogen cycling taxa in the soil microbiome may be underestimated using only DNA-based approaches. Accurately understanding the role of microbes and how they cycle nutrients is important for the development of sustainable bioenergy crops, and RNA-based approaches are recommended as a complement to DNA approaches to better understand the microbial, plant, and management interactions.

TI  - PFOS-induced alterations in phosphorus dynamics and soil microbial functions in wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), a widely persistent pollutant, poses significant ecological risks, yet its impact on critical nutrient cycles, such as phosphorus (P), in wetland ecosystems remains poorly understood. Phosphorus is essential for plant growth and microbial functions, and disruptions in its cycling can have profound effects on ecosystem stability. This study investigates the influence of PFOS on P dynamics and soil microbial functions in the rhizosphere of Phragmites communis. We examined how varying PFOS concentrations affect inorganic and organic P forms and microbial gene expression associated with P transformations. High PFOS concentrations significantly reduced shoot and root P content, corresponding to declines in labile phosphorus (NaHCO3-Pi). Additionally, shifts in microbial community diversity and composition were observed, particularly under high PFOS exposure, where key phosphorus-cycling genes, such as phoD in rhizosphere soils, showed significantly reduced transcriptional levels (as quantified by qRT-PCR), despite increased gene abundance as revealed by metagenomic sequencing. These findings offer new insights into how emerging contaminants like PFOS disrupt phosphorus cycling and microbial functions in wetland ecosystems, with broader implications for ecological risk assessments.

TI  - Worldwide comparison of carbon stocks and fluxes between native and non-native forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Climate change is one of the main challenges that human societies are currently facing. Given that forests represent major natural carbon sinks in terrestrial ecosystems, administrations worldwide are launching broad-scale programs to promote forests, including stands of non-native trees. Yet, non-native trees may have profound impacts on the functions and services of forest ecosystems, including the carbon cycle, as they may differ widely from native trees in structural and functional characteristics. Also, the allocation of carbon between above- and belowground compartments may vary between native and non-native forests and affect the vulnerability of the carbon stocks to disturbances. We conducted a global meta-analysis to compare carbon stocks and fluxes among co-occurring forests dominated by native and non-native trees, while accounting for the effects of climate, tree life stage, and stand type. We compiled 1678 case studies from 250 papers, with quantitative data for carbon cycle-related variables from co-occurring forests dominated by native and non-native trees. We included 170 non-native species from 42 families, spanning 55 countries from all continents except Antarctica. Non-native forests showed higher overall carbon stock due to higher aboveground tree biomass. However, the belowground carbon stock, particularly soil organic carbon, was greater in forests dominated by native trees. Among fluxes, carbon uptake rate was higher in non-native forests, while carbon loss rate and carbon lability did not differ between native and non-native forests. Differences in carbon stocks and fluxes between native and non-native trees were greater at early life stages (i.e. seedling and juvenile). Overall, non-native forests had greater carbon stocks and fluxes than native forests when both were natural/naturalised or planted; however, native natural forests had greater values for the carbon cycle-related variables than plantations of non-native trees. Our findings indicate that promoting non-native forests may increase carbon stocks in the aboveground compartment at the expense of belowground carbon stocks. This may have far-reaching implications on the durability and vulnerability of carbon to disturbances. Forestry policies aimed at improving long-term carbon sequestration and storage should conserve and promote native forests.

TI  - Insect herbivory accelerates nutrient cycling and increases plant production
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Ecologists hold two views about the role of herbivory in ecosystem dynamics. First, from a food web perspective in population/community ecology, consumption by herbivores reduces plant abundance. Second, from a nutrient cycling perspective in ecosystem ecology, herbivory sometimes slows dawn cycling, which decreases plant abundance, but at other times speeds up cycling, which possibly increases plant abundance. The nutrient cycling perspective on herbivory has been experimentally addressed more thoroughly in aquatic systems than in terrestrial systems. We experimentally examined how grasshoppers influence nutrient cycling and, thereby, plant abundance and plant species composition over a period of 5 years. We examined how grasshoppers influence nutrient (nitrogen) cycling (i) by their excrement, (ii) by changing the abundance of and the decomposition rate of plant litter, and (iii) by both. Grasshoppers may speed up nitrogen cycling by changing the abundance and decomposition rate of plant litter, which increases total plant abundance (up to 32.9 g/m(2) or 18%), especially, the abundance of plants that are better competitors when nitrogen is more available. However, whether grasshoppers enhance plant abundance depends on how much they consume. Consequently, ecosystems and food web perspectives are not mutually exclusive. Finally, under some conditions, grasshoppers may decrease nutrient cycling and plant abundance.

TI  - Earthworms and Phosphate-Solubilizing Bacteria Stimulate Nitrogen Storage and Cycling in a Manured Arid Soil
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
AB  - Improper reuse of manure could not only lead to low nitrogen-use efficiency but also result in environmental pollution. Therefore, we studied the effect of manure amendment with or without organisms (earthworm and bacteria) on soil nitrogen cycling, aiming to develop a more scientific way to reuse manure. In this study, six treatments, including control (CK), manure (M), manure + slurry (MS), manure + slurry + earthworm (MSE), manure + slurry + bacteria (MSB), and manure + slurry + earthworm + bacteria (MSEB) were divided into two groups to study the effect of manure and the effect of organism on the soil nitrogen pools and nitrogen cycling, respectively. The results showed that manure amendment coupled with organisms increased total nitrogen from 0.538 +/- 0.06 to 1.380 +/- 0.22 g kg(-1) , and available nitrogen from 67.28 +/- 5.22 to 113.11 +/- 12.21 mg kg(-1) , and improved soil organic nitrogen pool by increasing acid-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AHN) from 404 +/- 39 to 974 +/- 94 mg kg(-1) and non-acid-hydrolyzable nitrogen (NAHN) from 133 +/- 26 to 406 +/- 155 mg kg(-1) . Based on the results of soil inorganic nitrogen and soil enzyme activities, we further found that earthworms and bacteria accelerated soil nitrogen cycling by stimulating soil mineralization (ammonification and nitrification) and nitrifier denitrification, providing more available nitrogen to plants. Thus, we conclude that manure coupled with organisms would be a more efficient way to reuse manure via increasing soil nitrogen storage and availability simultaneously.

TI  - Herbivore trampling as an alternative pathway for explaining differences in nitrogen mineralization in moist grasslands
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Studies addressing the role of large herbivores on nitrogen cycling in grasslands have suggested that the direction of effects depends on soil fertility. Via selection for high quality plant species and input of dung and urine, large herbivores have been shown to speed up nitrogen cycling in fertile grassland soils while slowing down nitrogen cycling in unfertile soils. However, recent studies show that large herbivores can reduce nitrogen mineralization in some temperate fertile soils, but not in others. To explain this, we hypothesize that large herbivores can reduce nitrogen mineralization in loamy or clay soils through soil compaction, but not in sandy soils. Especially under wet conditions, strong compaction in clay soils can lead to periods of soil anoxia, which reduces decomposition of soil organic matter and, hence, N mineralization. In this study, we use a long-term (37-year) field experiment on a salt marsh to investigate the hypothesis that the effect of large herbivores on nitrogen mineralization depends on soil texture. Our results confirm that the presence of large herbivores decreased nitrogen mineralization rate in a clay soil, but not in a sandy soil. By comparing a hand-mown treatment with a herbivore-grazed treatment, we show that these differences can be attributed to herbivore-induced changes in soil physical properties rather than to above-ground biomass removal. On clay soil, we find that large herbivores increase the soil water-filled porosity, induce more negative soil redox potentials, reduce soil macrofauna abundance, and reduce decomposition activity. On sandy soil, we observe no changes in these variables in response to grazing. We conclude that effects of large herbivores on nitrogen mineralization cannot be understood without taking soil texture, soil moisture, and feedbacks through soil macrofauna into account.

TI  - Parent material and vegetation influence bacterial community structure and nitrogen functional genes along deep tropical soil profiles at the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Microbial communities mediate every step of the soil nitrogen cycle, yet the structure and associated nitrogen cycle functions of soil microbial communities remain poorly studied in tropical forests. Moreover, tropical forest soils are often many meters deep, but most studies of microbial nitrogen cycling have focused exclusively on surface soils. The objective of our study was to evaluate changes in bacterial community structure and nitrogen functional genes with depth in soils developed on two contrasting geological parent materials and two forest types that occur at different elevations at the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory in northeast Puerto Rico. We excavated three soil pits to 140 cm at four different sites representing the four soil x forest combinations (n = 12), and collected samples at ten-centimeter increments from the surface to 140 cm. We used bacterial 16S rRNA gene-DGGE (denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis) to fingerprint microbial community structures, and quantitative PCR to measure the abundance of five functional genes involved in various soil nitrogen transformations: nifH (nitrogen fixation), chiA (organic nitrogen decomposition), amoA (ammonia oxidation), nirS (nitrite reduction) and nosZ (nitrous oxide reduction). Multivariate analyses of DGGE fingerprinting patterns revealed differences in bacterial community structure across the four soil x forest types that were strongly correlated with soil pH (r = 0.69, P < 0.01) and nutrient stoichiometry (r(2) >= 0.36, P < 0.05). Across all soil and forest types, nitrogen functional genes declined significantly with soil depth (P < 0.001). Denitrification genes (nirS and nosZ) accounted for the largest proportion of measured nitrogen functional genes. Measured nitrogen functional genes were positively correlated with soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations (P < 0.001)and all genes except amoA were significantly more abundant in the Inceptisol soil type compared with the Oxisol soil type (P < 0.03). Greater abundances and a stronger vertical zonation of nitrogen functional genes in Inceptisols suggest more dynamic nitrogen transformation processes in this soil type. As the first study to examine bacterial nitrogen functional gene abundances below the surface 20 cm in tropical forest soils, our work provides insight into how pedogenically-driven vertical gradients control the nitrogen-cycling capacity of soil microbial communities. While previous studies have shown evidence for redox-driven hotspots in tropical nitrogen cycling on a watershed scale, our study corroborates this finding on a molecular scale.

TI  - Impact of broadleaf tree introduction on rhizosphere fungal communities and root phosphorus-cycling genes in conifers of near-natural transformed plantations
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is crucial for plant growth. However, its low availability in subtropical soils necessitates that trees rely on microorganisms for effective P acquisition. The introduction of broadleaf trees has been shown to facilitate P acquisition in coniferous plantations by altering the rhizosphere fungal communities. Despite this, functional shifts in these communities and the expression of root phosphorus cycling genes (PCGs) remain inadequately understood. This study investigated coniferous Pinus massoniana and Cunninghamia lanceolata plantations interplanted with broadleaf species associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. Rhizosphere soil and fine roots from the conifers were analyzed to examine soil bioavailable P fractions, root mycorrhizal colonization, rhizosphere fungal community composition, enzyme function predictions, and root PCGs expression. We found that citric-P in rhizospheric soil of P. massoniana increased with the introduction of Quercus gilva (an ECM-associated tree species), whereas Bray-P content in the rhizosphere of C. lanceolata decreased upon the introduction of either Q. gilva or Phoebe zhennan (an ECM-associated tree species). Moreover, the relative abundance of saprophytic fungi (e.g., Mortierella) increased following the introduction of broadleaf trees. Specifically, the introduction of Q. gilva was associated with elevated levels of organic P mineralization genes (e.g., phoA) and enzymes (e.g., phytases and acid phosphatase (ACP)) in conifers. In contrast, the introduction of P. zhennan increased the expression of inorganic P solubilization genes (such as qppC in P. massoniana roots and ppa in C. lanceolata roots). Key contributors to P absorption in conifer roots included Cenococcum, Rhizopogon, and Glomus. This study advances our understanding of P cycling in coniferous rhizospheres and the dynamics of coexisting mycorrhizal tree systems, yielding valuable insights into sustainable management of plantation ecosystems.

TI  - Effect of vegetation on soil bacteria and their potential functions for ecological restoration in the Hulun Buir Sandy Land, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
AB  - To date, much of research on revegetation has focused on soil microorganisms due to their contributions in the formation of soil and soil remediation process. However, little is known about the soil bacteria and their functions respond to the diverse vegetational types in the process of vegetation restoration. Effects of dominated vegetation, i.e., Artemisia halodendron Turcz Ex Bess, Caragana microphylla Lam., Hedysarum fruticosum Pall. and Pinus sylvestris L. on bacterial community structures and their potential functions in the Hulun Buir Sandy Land, China were determined using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) in 2015. Although the dominant phyla of soil bacterial community among different types of vegetation, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, were similar, the relative abundance of these dominant groups significantly differed, indicating that different types of vegetation might result in variations in the composition of soil bacterial community. In addition, functional genes of bacterial populations were similar among different types of vegetation, whereas its relative abundance was significantly differed. Most carbon fixation genes showed a high relative abundance in P. sylvestris, vs. recalcitrant carbon decomposition genes in A. halodendron, suggesting the variations in carbon cycling potential of different types of vegetation. Abundance of assimilatory nitrate reduction genes was the highest in P. sylvestris, vs. dissimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrate reductase genes in A. halodendron, indicating higher nitrogen gasification loss and lower nitrogen utilization gene functions in A. halodendron. The structures and functional genes of soil bacterial community showed marked sensitivities to different plant species, presenting the potentials for regulating soil carbon and nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Dissimilatory iron reduction contributes to anaerobic mineralization of sediment in a shallow transboundary lake
T2  - FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) coupled with carbon cycling is increasingly being recognized as an influential process in freshwater wetland soils and sediments. The role of DIR in organic matter (OM) mineralization, how-ever, is still largely unknown in lake sediment environments. In this study, we clarified rates and pathways of OM mineralization in two shallow lakes with seasonal hydrological connectivity and different eutrophic situations. We found that in comparison with the domination of DIR (55%) for OM mineralization in Lake Xiaoxingkai, the contribution of methanogenesis was much higher (68%) in its connected lake (Lake Xingkai). The differences in rates and pathways of sediment OM mineralization between the two lakes were attributed to higher concentra-tions of carbonate associated iron oxides (Fecarb) in Lake Xiaoxingkai compared to Lake Xingkai ( P = 0.002), due to better deposition mixing, more contributions of terrigenous detrital materials, and higher OM content in Lake Xiaoxingkai. Results of structural equation modeling showed that Fecarb and total iron content (TFe) regulated 25% of DIR in Lake Xiaoxingkai and 76% in Lake Xingkai, accompanied by a negative effect of TFe on methano-genesis in Lake Xingkai. The relative abundance and diversity of Fe-reducing bacteria were significantly different between the two lakes, and showed a weak effect on sediment OM mineralization. Our findings emphasize the role of iron minerals and geochemical characterizations in regulating rates and pathways of OM mineralization, and deepen the understanding of carbon cycling in lake sediments.

TI  - Fiddler crab burrowing increases salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Salt marshes are globally important sites of carbon burial, but microbial processes in their soil produce potent greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) that can be released back to the atmosphere. Although a great deal is known about how shifting seasons, tides, and salinity influence salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions, little effort has been devoted to understanding how emissions respond to bioturbation and pollution. In this study, we evaluated how fiddler crab bioturbation and oil pollution altered CO2 and CH4 fluxes from Louisiana salt marsh soil through a series of microcosm incubation experiments. CO2 and CH4 fluxes did not consistently increase as a function of crab burrow depth even though soil CO2 and CH4 concentrations increased with depth. Instead, regardless of burrow depth, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were highest (536.7 +/- 41.6 and 6.35 +/- 0.59 nmol g(-1) h(-1), respectively) immediately after burrowing activity ceased and within similar to 2 h decreased to a low background level (117.4 +/- 17.1 and 0.53 +/- 0.26). These background CO2 fluxes persisted through the end of our experiments, but background CH4 fluxes were not detectable after < 1 day, suggesting an important role for methanotrophy. Therefore, crab burrow size had a strong influence on CO2 fluxes, while the rate of burrow excavation was more important for CH4 fluxes. Low to moderate oil concentrations (up to 25.55 mg cm(-2)) did not alter greenhouse gas fluxes. However, severe oil contamination that decreases fiddler crab abundance and burrowing activity will also indirectly decrease salt marsh greenhouse gas emissions. These findings illuminate the importance of fiddler crab bioturbation to salt marsh carbon cycling and export.

TI  - Altered soil carbon and nitrogen cycles due to the freeze-thaw effect: A meta-analysis
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Global climate change may result in changes in snow cover, which may enhance freeze-thaw phenomena in mid and high latitude and high elevation ecosystems, especially in the northern hemisphere, in the future. As a common non-biological stress, the freeze-thaw process can substantially alter soil carbon and nitrogen cycles. However, a comprehensive understanding of nutrient pools and dynamics in response to freeze-thaw cycles is not available. Here, we evaluated the effect sizes of the responses of 18 variables related to soil carbon and nitrogen cycles to the freeze-thaw effect from 46 papers. Seventeen studies that reported field observations and 28 studies that reported results from laboratory experiments were included, as well as one paper that used both methods to explore freeze-thaw processes. We used a random-effects model to examine whether soil origins, effect phases (including initial and long-term effects), methods and soil horizons affect the magnitudes of the responses to freeze-thaw events. The soil sources include forest, shrubland, grassland/meadow, cropland, tundra and wetland. We used meta regression to explore possible relationships among effect sizes with freezing temperature, soil pH, soil C/N ratios and other factors. Our results suggest that the freeze-thaw process causes microbial N and the microbial C/N ratio to decrease by 12.2% and 8.5%, respectively. Soil solution dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are enhanced by 27.5% and 373%, respectively. The freeze thaw effect increases the concentrations of NHS4+, NOT and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) by 84.1%, 29.6% and 35.4%, respectively. N2O emissions are also increased by 95.0% in freeze-thaw treatments. Laboratory measurements resulted in contrasting responses in terms of mineralization, nitrification and respiration. Freeze-thaw events promote turnover of fine roots but have no effect on the long-term aboveground biomass of grassland and heath. The results of this meta-analysis help to achieve a better understanding of the overall effects of freeze-thaw events on soil carbon and nitrogen cycles and their modulation across different environments.

TI  - Biological weathering and the long-term carbon cycle: integrating mycorrhizal evolution and function into the current paradigm
T2  - GEOBIOLOGY
AB  - The dramatic decline in atmospheric CO2 evidenced by proxy data during the Devonian (416.0-359.2 Ma) and the gradual decline from the Cretaceous (145.5-65.5 Ma) onwards have been linked to the spread of deeply rooted trees and the rise of angiosperms, respectively. But this paradigm overlooks the coevolution of roots with the major groups of symbiotic fungal partners that have dominated terrestrial ecosystems throughout Earth history. The colonization of land by plants was coincident with the rise of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), while the Cenozoic (c. 65.5-0 Ma) witnessed the rise of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) that associate with both gymnosperm and angiosperm tree roots. Here, we critically review evidence for the influence of AMF and EMF on mineral weathering processes. We show that the key weathering processes underpinning the current paradigm and ascribed to plants are actually driven by the combined activities of roots and mycorrhizal fungi. Fuelled by substantial amounts of recent photosynthate transported from shoots to roots, these fungi form extensive mycelial networks which extend into soil actively foraging for nutrients by altering minerals through the acidification of the immediate root environment. EMF aggressively weather minerals through the additional mechanism of releasing low molecular weight organic chelators. Rates of biotic weathering might therefore be more usefully conceptualized as being fundamentally controlled by the biomass, surface area of contact, and capacity of roots and their mycorrhizal fungal partners to interact physically and chemically with minerals. All of these activities are ultimately controlled by rates of carbon-energy supply from photosynthetic organisms. The weathering functions in leading carbon cycle models require experiments and field studies of evolutionary grades of plants with appropriate mycorrhizal associations. Representation of the coevolution of roots and fungi in geochemical carbon cycle models is required to further our understanding of the role of the biota in Earth's CO2 and climate history.

TI  - High Frankia abundance and low diversity of microbial community are associated with nodulation specificity and stability of sea buckthorn root nodule
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Introduction : Actinorhizal symbioses are gaining attention due to the importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in sustainable agriculture. Sea buckthorn (Hippophae L.) is an important actinorhizal plant, yet research on the microbial community and nitrogen cycling in its nodules is limited. In addition, the influence of environmental differences on the microbial community of sea buckthorn nodules and whether there is a single nitrogen-fixing actinomycete species in the nodules are still unknown. Methods : We investigated the diversity, community composition, network associations and nitrogen cycling pathways of the microbial communities in the root nodule (RN), nodule surface soil (NS), and bulk soil (BS) of Mongolian sea buckthorn distributed under three distinct ecological conditions in northern China using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing. Combined with the data of environmental factors, the effects of environmental differences on different sample types were analyzed. Results: The results showed that plants exerted a clear selective filtering effect on microbiota, resulting in a significant reduction in microbial community diversity and network complexity from BS to NS to RN. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in the microbiomes of BS and NS. While RN was primarily dominated by Actinobacteria, with Frankia sp. EAN1pec serving as the most dominant species. Correlation analysis indicated that the host determined the microbial community composition in RN, independent of the ecological and geographical environmental changes of the sea buckthorn plantations. Nitrogen cycle pathway analyses showed that RN microbial community primarily functions in nitrogen fixation, and Frankia sp. EAN1pec was a major contributor to nitrogen fixation genes in RN. Discussion: This study provides valuable insights into the effects of eco-geographical environment on the microbial communities of sea buckthorn RN. These findings further prove that the nodulation specificity and stability of sea buckthorn root and Frankia sp. EAN1pec may be the result of their long-term co-evolution.

TI  - Responses of Soil Respiration and Ecological Environmental Factors to Warming and Thermokarst in River Source Wetlands of the Qinghai Lake Basin
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
AB  - Global climate warming has led to the deepening of the active layer of permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau, further triggering thermal subsidence phenomena, which have profound effects on the carbon cycle of regional ecosystems. This study conducted warming (W) and thermal subsidence (RR) control experiments using an Open-Top Chamber (OTC) device in the river source wetlands of the Qinghai Lake basin. The aim was to assess the impacts of warming and thermal subsidence on soil temperature, volumetric water content, biomass, microbial diversity, and soil respiration (both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration). The results indicate that warming significantly increased soil temperature, especially during the colder seasons, and thermal subsidence treatment further exacerbated this effect. Soil volumetric water content significantly decreased under thermal subsidence, with the RRW treatment having the most pronounced impact on moisture. Additionally, a microbial diversity analysis revealed that warming promoted bacterial richness in the surface soil, while thermal subsidence suppressed fungal community diversity. Soil respiration rates exhibited a unimodal curve during the growing season. Warming treatment significantly reduced autotrophic respiration rates, while thermal subsidence inhibited heterotrophic respiration. Further analysis indicated that under thermal subsidence treatment, soil respiration was most sensitive to temperature changes, with a Q10 value reaching 7.39, reflecting a strong response to climate warming. In summary, this study provides new scientific evidence for understanding the response mechanisms of soil carbon cycling in Tibetan Plateau wetlands to climate warming.

TI  - Impacts of Spartina alterniflora invasion on soil carbon components of particulate and mineral-associated organic matter and soil organic matter mineralization in estuarine wetlands
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Estuarine wetlands are critical global carbon sinks, significantly influencing the climate through carbon cycling. The invasive plant Spartina alterniflora has earned attention for its effects on these processes in wetland ecosystems. This study examines the impact of S. alterniflora on soil carbon dynamics in the Minjiang River estuarine wetland, Fujian Province, by comparing soil organic carbon (SOC) components in particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) between S. alterniflora and native Cyperus malaccensis stands. We also investigated soil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and organic carbon mineralization to assess how plant invasion alters carbon cycling in wetland soils. The invasion of S. alterniflora increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and labile organic carbon (LOC) in MAOM while reducing these carbon components in POM. LOC and MBC contents in MAOM were 15 % and 32 % higher, respectively, in S. alterniflora wetlands compared to C. malaccensis wetlands. This suggests that S. alterniflora shifts the composition and stability of SOC, making MAOM a more significant carbon pool. The invasion also led to higher CO2 emissions and greater temperature sensitivity. Additionally, S. alterniflora soils exhibited a negative priming effect upon glucose addition, likely due to the strong association between active organic carbon and minerals in MAOM, which protects organic matter from decomposition. These results highlight the intricate impacts of plant invasion on soil carbon cycling and offer insights for predicting carbon dynamics in estuarine wetlands.

TI  - Grass invasion effects on forest soil carbon depend on landscape-level land use patterns
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Plant invasions can alter the quality and quantity of detrital and root-derived inputs entering a system, thereby influencing the activities of microbial decomposers and affecting the soil carbon cycle. The effect of these inputs on soil carbon storage is often conflicting, suggesting strong context dependency in the plant-decomposer relationship. Whether there is a generalizable pattern that explains this dependency remains relatively unexplored. Here, we (1) examine how invasion by the exotic grass Microstegium vimineum affects carbon cycling across a land use gradient, and (2) evaluate the importance of inorganic nitrogen availability and other environmental variables for explaining patterns in soil carbon. Using paired invaded and uninvaded plots, we quantified invasion effects on belowground carbon pools, extracellular enzyme activities, and native leaf litter decomposition in forests embedded in an urban, agricultural, or forested landscape matrix. Compared to the urban matrix, invasion-associated declines in total soil organic carbon in the forested and agricultural landscapes were 3.5 and 2.5 times greater, respectively. Inorganic nitrogen availability and M. vimineum biomass interacted to explain these patterns: when both nitrogen availability and M. vimineum biomass were high, invaded soils exhibited higher total organic carbon, unchanged particulate organic matter carbon, and higher mineral-associated organic matter carbon compared to adjacent uninvaded soils. Consistent with these patterns, activities of carbon-mineralizing enzymes were lower in invaded than in uninvaded soils when both nitrogen availability and M. vimineum biomass were high. By contrast, decomposition of native leaf litter was faster when inorganic nitrogen availability and M. vimineum biomass were high. Our findings suggest that, although this invader may accelerate carbon cycling in forest soils, its effects on soil carbon storage largely depend on nitrogen availability and invader biomass, which can be altered by landscape-level patterns of land use. Additional research is needed to determine whether land use or other broad-scale processes such as atmospheric nitrogen deposition can explain context dependence in plant invasion effects on other ecosystem processes.

The exacerbated heavy metals concentrations deteriorate soil microbial activity and consequent microbial biomass, enzymatic activities, and organic matter are impaired. This study explores naturebased solutions, focusing on assisted natural remediation and organo-mineral amendments: marble waste (Mw), clay (Cy), and compost (Cp). Lupinus angustifolius L., a key bioremediator, is highlighted for its role in mine rehabilitation, adaptation to extreme edaphic conditions, and contribution to enhanced nutritional status. The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the synergetic impact of the use of L. angustifolius with four soil combined treatments (Com): Com1: Cy2.5-Cp2.5-Mw10; Com2: Cy2.5-Cp5-Mw5; Com3: Cy7.5-Cp2.5-Mw7.5; and Com4: Cy10Cp10-Mw10. As a practical approach to sustainable mining soil rehabilitation, it emphasizes soil microbial biomass and activity, soil fertility, plant growth, and heavy metal immobilization in a concise and impactful manner. These combinations were used as the soil substrate material for a four-month greenhouse experiment where plant growth parameters, heavy metal accumulation, soil properties, microbial activity, and bioavailable metal content were determined. The study underscored the positive effects of the treatments Com1, Com3, and Com4 on heavy metal mobility, microbial biomass, and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus-acquiring enzymes. Notably, bioavailable heavy metals were effectively reduced, with copper, zinc, and lead decreasing up to 2-fold, 2-fold, and 1.8-fold, respectively. Microbial biomass and soil enzyme activities responded positively to our amendments, indicating improved nutrient cycling. Microbial biomass carbon increased up to 4-fold, and similarly, beta-glucosidase, N-acetyl-ss-glucosaminidases, L-Arginase, and acid phosphatase (Pho) increased up to 1.9-fold, 47-fold, 12.85-fold, and 2-fold, respectively. Furthermore, soil carbon and nitrogen contents increased up to 11.15-fold and 9.41-fold, respectively. This study suggested a positive and impactful influence on the intricate processes of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, indicative of increased microbial activity, and offered a nature-based solution to mitigate the environmental impact of extensive mining.

TI  - Impact of Phalaris arundinacea cultivation on microbial community of a cutover peatland
T2  - BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB  - Organic peat soils have been extensively drained and used for agricultural, horticultural and energy purposes. The management practices of organic soils accelerate decomposition processes resulting generally in loss of carbon. Microbes are the key players in soil carbon cycling. We studied the effects of cultivation of a perennial bioenergy plant (reed canary grass, Phalanx arundinacea) on microbial biomass carbon, microbial respiration and microbial communities in an old, previously uncultivated peat soil. The cultivation increased the amount of microbial biomass carbon and microbial respiration in peat mostly in the uppermost 5 cm layer where the impacts of roots and litter are most pronounced. As shown by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, the abundance of fungi and gram-negative bacteria increased with cultivation, while the abundance of gram-positive bacteria decreased. The implications of these changes on carbon cycling and carbon storage in peat under reed canary grass are discussed.

TI  - Pristine and Sulfidized Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles Promote the Release and Decomposition of Organic Carbon in the Legume Rhizosphere
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The effects and mechanisms of zinc oxide nanoparticles(ZnO NPs)and their aging products, sulfidized (s-) ZnO NPs, on the carbon cyclingin the legume rhizosphere are still unclear. We observed that, after30 days of cultivation, in the rhizosphere soil of Medicago truncatula, under ZnO NP and s-ZnO NP treatments,the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were significantlyincreased by 1.8- to 2.4-fold compared to Zn2+ treatments,although the soil organic matter (SOM) contents did not change significantly.Compared to Zn2+ additions, the additions of NPs significantlyinduced the production of root metabolites such as carboxylic acidsand amino acids and also stimulated the growth of microbes involvedin the degradations of plant-derived and recalcitrant SOM, such asbacteria genera RB41 and Bryobacter, and fungi genus Conocybe. The bacterial co-occurrencenetworks indicated that microbes associated with SOM formation anddecomposition were significantly increased under NP treatments. Theadsorption of NPs by roots, the generation of root metabolites (e.g.,carboxylic acid and amino acid), and enrichment of key taxa (e.g., RB41 and Gaiella) were the major mechanismsby which ZnO NPs and s-ZnO NPs drove DOC release and SOM decompositionin the rhizosphere. These results provide new perspectives on theeffect of ZnO NPs on agroecosystem functions in soil-plantsystems.
   The adsorption of ZnO NPs ands-ZnO NPs on the roots promotedthe generation of root secretions and changes the composition andfunction of microbes involved in the carbon cycle, thus acceleratingSOM decomposition, which provided a new perspective on the influenceof nanomaterials on ecological function.

TI  - Five-year impacts of biomass crop monoculture on soil enzyme activity, nitrogen pools, and other soil health indicators
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - Soil health and nitrogen cycling are critical for sustainable biomass production, yet the long-term effects of monoculture biomass cropping on these factors remain underexplored. This study examines the five-year monoculture cultivation effects of giant reed (Arundo donax L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus), and sida (Sida hermaphrodita) on soil biochemical properties, nitrogen species, and biomass yield stability under field conditions. Soil samples collected in autumn 2014 and spring 2015 revealed significant seasonal and cropspecific impacts on soil health indicators. Giant reed cultivation resulted in the highest urease activity in autumn (346 mu g NH4+ g- 1 soil h- 1), supporting enhanced nitrogen cycling, while miscanthus increased soil organic matter (SOM) to 4.77 % in spring, aiding carbon sequestration. Sida contributed to the highest dehydrogenase activity, indicating robust microbial activity, alongside increased organic nitrogen (4.92 mg kg- 1) and total nitrogen levels (17.0 mg kg- 1) in spring. Soil respiration and electrical conductivity varied by season, with pH values slightly higher in spring. Across all crops, nitrogen forms (nitrate, ammonium, and organic nitrogen) were generally higher in spring than autumn, highlighting seasonal dynamics. Yield stability was greatest in giant reed (2.01 kg m- 2 on average), while miscanthus and sida averaged 1.62 and 0.86 kg m-2, respectively. The findings underscore these crops' potential for sustainable biomass production and improved soil health in low-input systems.

TI  - Warming-induced response of microbial diversity and functions regulated microbial necromass and soil multifunctionality
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Microbial necromass has been proved to be an important source of stable soil organic carbon (SOC), responding sensitively to global climate warming. Nevertheless, how the response of the soil microbial community to warming influences microbial necromass and ecosystem multifunctionality remains unclear. Here, amino sugars (ASs) were investigated as biomarkers of microbial necromass to evaluate bacterial and fungal necromass in a 60day indoor warming incubation experiment, as well as the contribution of bacterial and fungal necromass to SOC. And amplicon sequencing and a high-throughput qPCR-based chip were integrated the changes in soil microbial community composition of whole, abundant, and rare taxa, as well as microbial traits (diversity, functional genes). The results showed that warming altered soil microbial community compositions, especially fungi. Under warming, bacterial necromass C and its contribution to SOC increased, while vice versa for fungi. The changes in microbial necromass C were closely associated with increasing C degradation gene abundance, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and chitin degradation genes. Warming slightly increased soil ecosystem multifunctionality in relation to soil carbon cycling, associated with soil microbial diversity. Rare taxa diversity broadly promoted most single functions and multifunctionality. The impacts of different microbial taxa diversity on multifunctionality were broadly following the order: fungi > bacteria, abundant taxa > whole taxa > rare taxa. Simultaneously accounting for the effects of warming on multiple biotic and abiotic factors, multifunctionality and the contribution of microbial necromass to SOC were driven by nitrogen content, pH, soil microbial biomass, and diversity. Therefore, this study emphasized the crucial roles of microbial diversity, and microbial functions in regulating soil organic carbon pools and soil carbon cycling functions under global climate warming.

TI  - Nitrifying and denitrifying microbes exhibit distinct community structure and activity responses to different crop rotation systems in subtropical paddy soils
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The adverse impacts of double-season rice cultivation on soil health and crop yield can be alleviated by crop rotation. However, the mechanisms by which biotic and abiotic factors influence microbial nitrogen cycling under different crop rotation systems remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the impact of crop rotation in paddy soils on the community abundance, composition, and activity of nitrifying microbes (ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria (AOA and AOB)) and denitrifying microbes (nirK- and nirS-denitrifiers). A 6-year field experiment was performed with four crop rotation systems: (1) double rice as a control, (2) middle-season rice-fallow rotation (MR), (3) middle-season rice-oilseed rape rotation (MROR), and (4) middle-season rice-pak choi-oilseed rape rotation (MRPOR). AOB abundance increased significantly in MROR and MRPOR treatments, whereas AOA abundance decreased significantly in MROR. nirS gene abundance was significantly lower in MROR and MRPOR treatments, whereas nirK gene abundance was significantly lower in MR and MRPOR treatments. AOB and nirK gene community structures were significantly altered by crop rotation; this relationship was closely correlated with soil water content and NO3--N concentration. For MROR and MRPOR treatments, potential nitrification activity was significantly increased and positively correlated with AOB abundance, whereas denitrification enzyme activity was significantly decreased and correlated with nirK and nirS community structure. Therefore, nitrifiers and denitrifiers exhibit distinct responses to crop rotation in paddy soils, which may influence microbial nitrogen cycling. These findings have practical implications for selecting appropriate cropping regimes.

TI  - Nitrogen and phosphorus limitation of biomass growth in a tropical secondary forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - Understanding secondary successional processes in Amazonian terrestrial ecosystems is becoming increasingly important as continued deforestation expands the area that has become secondary forest, or at least has been through a recent phase of secondary forest growth. Most Amazonian soils are highly weathered and relatively nutrient poor, but the role of nutrients as a factor determining successional processes is unclear. Soils testing and chronosequence studies have yielded equivocal results regarding the possible role of nutrient limitation. The objective of this paper is to report the first two years' results of a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in a 6-yr-old secondary forest growing on an abandoned cattle pasture on a clayey Oxisol. Growth of remnant grasses responded significantly to the N + P treatment, whereas tree biomass increased significantly following N-only and N + P treatments. The plants took up about 10% of the 50 kg P/ha of the first year's application, and recovery in soil fractions could account for the rest. The trees took up about 20% of the 100 kg N/ha of the first year's application. No changes in soil inorganic N, soil microbial biomass N, or litter decomposition rates have been observed so far, but soil faunal abundances increased in fertilized plots relative to the control in the second year of the study. A pulse of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emissions was measured in the N-treated plots only shortly after the second year's application. Net N mineralization and net nitrification assays demonstrated strong immobilization potential, indicating that much of the N was probably retained in the large soil organic-N pool. Although P availability is low in these soils and may partially limit biomass growth, the most striking result of this study so far is the significant response of tree growth to N fertilization. Repeated fire and other losses of N from degraded pastures may render tree growth N limited in some young Amazonian forests. Changes in species composition and monitoring of long-term effects on biomass accumulation will be addressed as this experiment is continued.

TI  - Global Meta-Analysis Reveals the Responses of Carbon Cycle to Grazing Exclusion in Grasslands
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Despite a large number of field manipulative grazing exclusion experiments having been conducted on global grassland ecosystems, the general patterns of how grazing exclusion affects the ecosystem carbon cycle remain unclear. Research on the impact of grazing exclusion on the carbon cycle in grassland ecosystems will help to more accurately assess the role and effectiveness of grazing exclusion. Here, we used a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the responses of 12 variables associated with carbon pools and fluxes to grazing exclusion based on 226 studies in global grasslands. Our results indicated that grazing exclusion significantly increased carbon pools and fluxes in grassland ecosystems, except for methane emission (CH4) and net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE). Specifically, the effect size of litter increased the most at +4.90, followed by aboveground biomass (AGB) at +3.93, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at +2.58, soil organic carbon (SOC) at +2.24, belowground biomass (BGB) at +2.14, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) at +2.12, carbon dioxide emission (CO2) at +1.78, ecosystem respiration (ER) at +1.17, soil respiration (Rs) at +0.93, and net primary productivity (NPP) at +0.72. Grazing exclusion duration and climate factors were the primary drivers of changes in carbon pools and fluxes. We demonstrated the time thresholds by establishing the general response curves of changes in carbon pools and fluxes with grazing exclusion duration. Moreover, AGB, BGB, SOC, DOC, Rs, NEE, and CO2 showed an initial rise and then a decline with grazing exclusion duration, and there was a time threshold which was 17 years, 19 years, 26 years, 6 years, 7 years, 30 years, and 8 years, respectively. We found a significant decrease in DOC (slope: -0.59), litter (-0.28), CO2 (-0.24), NPP (-0.17), and NEE (-0.04) with mean annual temperature. We also found a significant decrease in CH4 (-0.008), NEE (-0.006), MBC (-0.003), ER (-0.003), and AGB (-0.002), but a significant increase in CO2 (+0.011) and NPP (+0.009) with mean annual precipitation. Overall, when carbon sequestration is the goal of management, the role and application of grazing exclusion in grasslands should be reconsidered in terms of grazing exclusion duration and climate factors.

TI  - Late quaternary changes in carbon cycling on Mt. Kenya, East Africa: an overview of the δ13C record in lacustrine organic matter
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
CP  - Meeting on Isotopes in Quaternary Palaeoenvironmental Reconstruction
AB  - The delta(13)C signature of sedimentary organic matter acts as a tracer for past changes in the terrestrial and aquatic carbon cycles. Compound-specific delta(13)C analysis enables these two signals to be disentangled. We compare the molecular-isotopic records from a transect of five lakes between 1820 and 4595 in a.s.l. on Mt. Kenya, East Africa, spanning the last similar to 100,000 years, with multiproxy palaeoenvironmental data, in order to determine the mechanisms underlying Late Quaternary variations in carbon cycling at different altitudes. The amplitude of down-core variations in the delta(13)C values of total organic carbon varied from 4.8%. to 17.4%o. The delta(13)C signals in compounds of terrestrial, aquatic-macrophyte and algal origin were tightly coupled, reflecting strong atmospheric control. During the early glacial and the last glacial maximum, the effects of sub-ambient CO, and enhanced moisture stress reinforced each other, resulting in carbon starvation and very high delta(13)C values. In contrast, smaller, millennial-scale shifts in delta(13)C during the late-glacial and Holocene were driven primarily by fluctuations in monsoon precipitation. However, the impact of Late Quaternary atmospheric changes were complex, involving variations in biomass burning, vegetation cover, soil erosion, lake levels and water chemistry in addition to direct physiological responses by higher plants and algae.

TI  - Nitrogen-cycling processes under long-term compound heavy metal(loids) pressure around a gold mine: Stimulation of nitrite reduction
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - Mining and tailings deposition can cause serious heavy metal(loids) pollution to the surrounding soil environment. Soil microorganisms adapt their metabolism to such conditions, driving alterations in soil function. This study aims to elucidate the response patterns of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms under long-term heavy metal(loids) exposure. The results showed that the diversity and abundance of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms showed negative feedback to heavy metal(loids) concentrations. Denitrifying microorganisms were shown to be the dominant microorganisms with over 60% of relative abundance and a complex community structure including 27 phyla. Further, the key bacterial species in the denitrification process were calculated using a random forest model, where the top three key species ( Pseudomonas stutzei, Sphingobium japonicum and Leifsonia rubra ) were found to play a prominent role in nitrite reduction. Functional gene analysis and qPCR revealed that nirK, which is involved in nitrite reduction, significantly accumulated in the most metal-rich soil with the increase of absolute abundance of 63.86%. The experimental results confirmed that the activity of nitrite reductase (Nir) encoded by nirK in the soil was increased at high concentrations of heavy metal(loids). Partial least squares-path model identified three potential modes of nitrite reduction processes being stimulated by heavy metal(loids), the most prominent of which contributed to enhanced nirK abundance and soil Nir activity through positive stimulation of key species. The results provide new insights and preliminary evidence on the stimulation of nitrite reduction processes by heavy metal(loids).

TI  - Uniting the scales of microbial biogeochemistry with trait-based modelling
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Below-ground microbial communities drive some of Earth's largest biogeochemical fluxes, yet they represent a major source of uncertainty in global biogeochemical models. This review synthesizes recent advances in trait-based soil carbon modelling in order to identify how empirical observations of microbial traits can inform the next generation of soil carbon models. We identify four key perspectives from which trait-based models have investigated the role of microbes in soil carbon fluxes, ranging from the largest to the smallest scales of biological organization: (i) Earth system models, which have recently begun to incorporate microbial traits at a global scale; (ii) ecosystem models, which relate microbial carbon cycling to other trophic levels and element cycles; (iii) models from community ecology, which link theories of species diversity to ecosystem cycles; and (iv) models of fine-scale physiology, which mechanistically represent traits at the individual level. Highlighting the contributions of diverse trait-based modelling approaches, we caution that this diversity makes it challenging to link perspectives at different scales. The meaning of a trait depends both on the structure of the model in which it occurs and on the scale treated by the model. Thus, reapplying a fine-scale trait at a broader scale may make incorrect predictions, an issue we illustrate quantitatively using model simulations. With these challenges in mind, we highlight several ways to synthesize the scales of microbial biogeochemical modelling: (i) quantitatively, using mathematical scaling techniques, (ii) empirically, by applying experiments to test relationships between scales and (iii) conceptually, by identifying key traits and processes across scales. Taking full advantage of trait-based modelling, ecologists will thus be able to incorporate multiple perspectives to better predict carbon cycling in a changing world.

TI  - Effects of biodegradable microplastics and straw addition on soil greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Large pieces of plastic are transformed into microplastic particles through weathering, abrasion, and ultraviolet radiation, significantly impacting the soil ecosystem. However, studies on biodegradable microplastics replacing traditional microplastics as agricultural mulching films to drive the biogeochemical processes influenced by GHG are still in their initial stages, with limited relevant reports available. This study sought to investigate the effects of microplastic and straw addition on CO2 and N2O emissions in different soils. Herein, yellow-brown soil (S1) and fluvo-aquic soil (S2) were utilized, each treated with three different concentrations of PLA (polylactic acid) microplastics (0.25%, 2%, and 7% w/w) at 25 degrees C for 35 days, with and without straw addition. The results showed that straw (1% w/w) significantly increased soil CO2 by 4.1-fold and 3.2-fold, respectively, and N2O by 1.8-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, in cumulative emissions in S1 and S2 compared with the control. PLA microplastics significantly increased CO2 emissions by 71.5% and 99.0% and decreased N2O emissions by 30.1% and 24.7% at a high concentration (7% w/w, PLA3) in S1 and S2 compared with the control, respectively. The same trend was observed with the addition of straw and microplastics together. Structural equation modeling and redundancy analysis confirmed that soil physiochemical parameters, enzyme and microbial activities are key factors regulating CO2 and N2O emissions. The addition of microplastics is equivalent to the addition of carbon sources, which can significantly affect DOC, MBC, SOC and the abundance of carbon-associated bacteria (CbbL), thereby increasing soil CO2 emissions. The addition of microplastics alone inhibited the activity of nitrogen cycling enzymes (urease activity), increasing the abundance of denitrifying microbes. However, adding a high amount of microplastics and straw together released plastic additives, inhibiting microbial abundance and reducing the nitrogen cycle. These effects decreased NH4+-N and increased NO3--N, resulting in decreased N2O emissions. This study indicates that biodegradable microplastics could reduce soil plastic residue pollution through degradation. However, their use could also increase CO2 emissions and decrease N2O emissions. Consequently, this research lays the groundwork for further investigation into the implications of utilizing biodegradable microplastics as agricultural mulch, particularly concerning soil geochemistry and GHG emissions.

TI  - Microclimate explains little variation in year-round decomposition across an Arctic tundra landscape
T2  - NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Litter decomposition represents a major path for atmospheric carbon influx into Arctic soils, thereby controlling below-ground carbon accumulation. Yet, little is known about how tundra litter decomposition varies with microenvironmental conditions, hindering accurate projections of tundra soil carbon dynamics with future climate change. Over 14 months, we measured landscape-scale decomposition of two contrasting standard litter types (Green tea and Rooibos tea) in 90 plots covering gradients of micro-climate and -topography, vegetation cover and traits, and soil characteristics in Western Greenland. We used the tea bag index (TBI) protocol to estimate relative variation in litter mass loss, decomposition rate (k) and stabilisation factor (S) across space, and structural equation modelling (SEM) to identify relationships among environmental factors and decomposition. Contrasting our expectations, microenvironmental factors explained little of the observed variation in both litter mass loss, as well as k and S, suggesting that the variables included in our study were not the major controls of decomposer activity in the soil across the studied tundra landscape. We use these unexpected findings of our study combined with findings from the current literature to discuss future avenues for improving our understanding of the drivers of tundra decomposition and, ultimately, carbon cycling across the warming Arctic.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi promote functional gene regulation of phosphorus cycling in rhizosphere microorganisms of Iris tectorum under Cr stress
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES
AB  - The mutualistic symbiotic system formed by clumping arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plants can remediate heavy metal -contaminated soils. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the interaction between AMF and inter -root microbial communities, particularly their impact on organic phosphorus (P) cycling, remain unclear. This study investigated the gene regulation processes involved in inter -root soil phosphorus cycling in wetland plants, specifically Iris tectorum , following inoculation with AMF under varying concentrations of chromium (Cr) stress. Through macro-genome sequencing, we analyzed the composition and structure of the inter -root soil microbial community associated with Iris tectorum under greenhouse pot conditions. The results demonstrated significant changes in the diversity and composition of the inter -root soil microbial community following AMF inoculation, with Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes being the dominant taxa. Under Cr stress, species and gene co -occurrence network analysis revealed that AMF promoted the transformation process of organic phosphorus mineralization and facilitated inorganic phosphorus uptake. Additionally, network analysis of functional genes indicated strong aggregation of ( pstS, pstA, pstC, TC.PIT, phoR, pp-gppA ) genes, which collectively enhanced phosphorus uptake by plants. These findings shed light on the inter -root soil phosphorus cycling process during the co-remediation of Cr -contaminated soil by AMF- Iris tectorum symbiosis, providing valuable theoretical support for the application of AMF-wetland plant symbiosis systems to remediate heavy metal -contaminated soil.

TI  - Effect of soil archaea on N 2 O emission in alpine permafrost
T2  - RESEARCH IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
AB  - Soil microbial communities are pivotal in permafrost biogeochemical cycles, yet the variations of abundant and rare microbial taxa and their impacts on greenhouse gas emissions in different seasons, remain elusive, especially in the case of soil archaea. Here, we conducted a study on soil abundant and rare archaeal taxa during the growing and non-growing seasons in the active layer of alpine permafrost in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results suggested that, for the archaeal communities in the sub-layer, abundant taxa exhibited higher diversity, while rare taxa maintained a more stable composition from the growing to non-growing season. Water soluble organic carbon and soil porosity were the most significant environmental variables affecting the compositions of abundant and rare taxa, respectively. Stochastic and deterministic processes dominated the assemblies of rare and abundant taxa, respectively. The archaeal ecological network influenced N2O flux through different modules. Rare taxa performed an essential role in stabilizing the network and exerting important effects on N2O flux. Our study provides a pioneering and comprehensive investigation aimed at unravelling the mechanisms by which archaea or other microorganisms influence greenhouse gas emissions in the alpine permafrost.

TI  - Effect of three rhizobacteria on lettuce growth and soil N2O emission and their impact on the rhizosphere bacterial community in acidic field experiments
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Aims Acidic soils have a high potential for nitrous oxide (N2O) emission. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) may mitigate N2O emissions in acidic soils; however, the reduction capacity and their microbiological mechanisms are poorly understood. We investigated the effects of three PGPR strains (Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis NRCB002, Stutzerimonas stutzeri NRCB010, and B. velezensis NRCB026) on crop growth and N2O emissions in acidic soils, and explored their microbial mechanisms.Methods and results A field experiment was conducted to assess the effects of inoculation with NRCB002, NRCB010, and NRCB026 on lettuce growth and N2O emissions from acidic soil and to study the associated microbiological mechanisms. The results indicated that inoculation with NRCB002, NRCB010, and NRCB026 significantly promoted lettuce growth and decreased N2O emissions from soil by 16.3%, 36.2%, and 45.8%, respectively. Furthermore, inoculation with these three strains altered the microbial community composition and nitrogen cycle functional gene abundance in acidic soils. Structural equation models indicated that inoculation with these three strains affected N2O emissions from the soil by modulating soil pH, relative abundance of Proteobacteria, and nosZ gene copy numbers. N2O emissions from soil inoculated with NRCB002 were negatively correlated with nosZI gene copy number, while NRCB010 and NRCB026 were negatively correlated with nosZII gene copy number.Conclusions PGPR strains enhanced lettuce growth and decreased acidic soil N2O emissions under field conditions. Among the three strains, NRCB026 significantly decreased N2O emission from acidic soil.

TI  - Changes in Mangrove Blue Carbon under Elevated Atmospheric CO2
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - While there is consensus that blue carbon ecosystems, such as mangroves, have an important role in mitigating some aspects of global climate change, little is known about mangrove carbon cycling under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO2). Here, we review studies in order to identify pathways for how eCO2might influence mangrove ecosystem carbon cycling. In general, eCO2 alters plant productivity, species community composition, carbon fluxes, and carbon deposition in ways that enhance mangrove carbon storage with eCO2. As a result, a negative feedback to climate change exists whereby eCO2 adds to mangrove's ability to sequester additional carbon, which in turn reduces the rate by which CO2 builds. Furthermore, eCO2 affects warming and sea-level rise (SLR) through alternate pathways, which coinfluence the mangrove response in both antagonistic (i.e., warming = greater carbon loss to decomposition) and synergistic (i.e., SLR = greater soil carbon burial) ways. eCO2 is projected to become a more prominent driver in the future before reaching a steady state. However, given the complexity of the interactions of biological and environmental factors with eCO2, long-term field observations and in situ simulation experiments can help to better understand the mechanisms for proper model initialization to predict future changes in mangrove carbon sequestration.

TI  - Soil functional microbes can modify the plant functional diversity mainly through changing the plant functional traits of evergreen species in karst forests
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - AimsThe dynamic interactions between plants and soil serve as the underlying mechanisms that drive various ecological processes linked to the biodiversity maintenance. Previous studies suggested soil microbes played an important role in linking the soil and plants. However, how and to what extent the soil functional microbes influence the plant functional community structure is still unclear, especially in sensitive karst forests.MethodsWe established a series of forest dynamic plots (FDPs) along the natural regeneration in the Maolan National Nature Reserve, a typical karst forest ecosystem, to explore the roles of soil microbial functional genes on the plant functional diversity (FD).ResultsComparison analysis found significant changes in the relative abundance of soil microbial functional genes involved in nitrogen cycling (N-cycling), soil physicochemical properties, and the community-weighted variance (CWV) of plant functional traits as well as FD. In addition, variations in soil physicochemical properties mediated by soil microbial functional genes involved in N-cycling were closely related to changes in plant FD. Furthermore, evergreen species rather than deciduous ones were found to play the dominant role in determining the plant functional community structure.ConclusionsThis study highlighted the critical role of microbial communities in stabilizing ecosystem functioning and the disproportionate contribution of species with different life forms along the natural regeneration in karst evergreen-deciduous mixed forests.

TI  - Competition between ammonia-oxidizing archaea and complete ammonia oxidizers from freshwater environments
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Aerobic ammonia oxidizers (AOs) are prokaryotic microorganisms that contribute to the global nitrogen cycle by performing the first step of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium to nitrite and nitrate. While aerobic AOs are found ubiquitously, their distribution is controlled by key environmental conditions such as substrate (ammonium) availability. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) are generally found in oligotrophic environments with low ammonium availability. However, whether AOA and comammox share these habitats or outcompete each other is not well understood. We assessed the competition for ammonium between an AOA and comammox enriched from the freshwater Lake Burr Oak. The AOA enrichment culture (AOA-BO1) contained Nitrosarchaeum sp. BO1 as the ammonia oxidizer and Nitrospira sp. BO1 as the nitrite oxidizer. The comammox enrichment BO4 (cmx-BO4) contained the comammox strain Nitrospira sp. BO4. The competition experiments were performed either in continuous cultivation with ammonium as a growth-limiting substrate or in batch cultivation with initial ammonium concentrations of 50 and 500 mu M. Regardless of the ammonium concentration, Nitrospira sp. BO4 outcompeted Nitrosarchaeum sp. BO1 under all tested conditions. The dominance of Nitrospira sp. BO4 could be explained by the ability of comammox to generate more energy through the complete oxidation of ammonia to nitrate and their more efficient carbon fixation pathway-the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle. Our results are supported by the higher abundance of comammox compared to AOA in the sediment of Lake Burr Oak.IMPORTANCENitrification is a key process in the global nitrogen cycle. Aerobic ammonia oxidizers play a central role in the nitrogen cycle by performing the first step of nitrification. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) are the dominant nitrifiers in environments with low ammonium availability. While AOA have been studied for almost 20 years, comammox were only discovered 8 years ago. Until now, there has been a gap in our understanding of whether AOA and comammox can co-exist or if one strain would be dominant under ammonium-limiting conditions. Here, we present the first study characterizing the competition between freshwater AOA and comammox under varying substrate concentrations. Our results will help in elucidating the niches of two key nitrifiers in freshwater lakes.

TI  - Hydrological controls on carbon metabolism in wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - Governed by a series of non-linear feedback mechanisms among water, vegetation and decomposers, carbon storage within wetlands is important on a global scale. However, the effect that climatic fluctuations have on those mechanisms is not well documented. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic model connecting hydrology, vegetation and microbial biomass to investigate how changes in the climate signal propagate through wetland ecosystems, via vegetation and microbial dynamics, and attempt to quantify how net rates of wetland carbon metabolism change in response to a changing climate. Our particular focus is the dryland-wetland systems found in south-west Western Australia (SWWA), as they are expected to be sensitive to projected climatic changes due to their close linkage to the seasonal water delivery pattern. The model simulations investigate wetland carbon retention under different hydroclimatological conditions ranging across a regional gradient in the dryness index. The results indicate that short term and long term vegetation responses may be counter-intuitive due to adaptability in the water uptake strategy of the vegetation community partially decoupling biomass from water availability. Furthermore, changes in water delivery are not a good indicator for overall changes in wetland metabolism, defined as the net rate of carbon assimilation, due to the dominance of the soil carbon storages and their sensitivity to heightened bacterial metabolism rates with increasing temperatures. The results highlight that an optimum combination of water supply and vegetation leads to a higher percentage of carbon being stored in soils, therefore increasing the resistance of the carbon storage to changes in precipitation. The model presented here provides a first step to explain how changing patterns of rainfall, temperature and evapotranspiration can change carbon cycling characteristics and the carbon retention efficiency of dryland-wetlands.

TI  - Straw retention drives microbial community succession to improve soil C/N cycling: insights from a multi-year rice-based system
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - The soil microbial community plays a crucial role in driving the decomposition and mineralization of plant residues, thereby affecting carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling and storage. Straw retention provides soil with C and N sources, which enhances microbial community composition and nutrient cycling. While long-term straw retention has been shown to improve soil quality and nutrient-use efficiency, the impacts of short-term straw-return treatment on soil quality and the underlying microbiological mechanism of straw in improving soil fertility and nutrient-use efficiency remain unclear. The present study aimed to elucidate the dynamic responses of soil microbial community structure and function to rice straw retention using a multi-year field experiment. The findings revealed that rice straw returned for 3 and 5 consecutive years (S3 and S5, respectively), enhanced soil organic carbon (SOC) and available phosphorous (AP) contents, increased fungal biomass, and stimulated the growth of cellulose-decomposing microbial communities. Furthermore, S3 and S5 treatments increased the activities of C cycling enzymes (beta-xylosidase) and N cycling enzymes (N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and urease). These treatments also increased the genes abundance associated with C-cycling (sdimo), nitrification (amoA and amoB), and N fixation (nifH), while enriched genes related to C cycling and N metabolism pathways (nitrification and nitrate reduction). In contrast, the abundance of genes involved in denitrification (nirS) was reduced. However, S3 and S5 treatments led to an increased abundance of the plant pathogens Magnaporthe oryzae and Ustilaginoidea virens. This work demonstrates that short-term straw retention effectively enhances soil microecological environment and microbial functionality and also underscores the need for strategies to mitigate pathogen accumulation for sustainable agricultural practices.

TI  - Oinez Basoa: Using school-managed afforested land for soil education in Navarre, Spain
T2  - SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - The study of soils in secondary education is a topic of debate because it remains little considered in official curricula and programs at pre-university education, despite the increasing concern about soil in environmental studies. In this work, we present the results of a case-study conducted with a class of the 4th grade of compulsory secondary education (10th school year), where a didactic sequence was used that included actual data obtained in an afforestation chronosequence. The afforestation was part of the activities conducted by the network of schools to which the school belonged, with the aim of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions resulting from their annual fund-raising event. In a first step, a series of indicators related to soil and vegetation were determined in the afforested soil using a space-for-time approach with a nearby cultivated soil (corresponding to the original situation of the afforested soil) and a mature forest (similar to the target situation of the afforested land). Plant biodiversity, soil microbial biomass C and total organic C, and organic matter decomposition indicators were determined and observed to be in an intermediate situation in the afforested land between the cultivated soil and the mature forest, seven years after afforestation. In particular, an effective atmospheric C sequestration was verified from a difference of 12.41 +/- 1.06 Mg of organic C per hectare in the afforested soil compared to the cultivated control. Data issued from this analysis were used to prepare a collaborative jigsaw activity that was integrated into the didactic sequence designed to introduce the concepts of ecosystem successions and the carbon cycle. This project had a special focus on the role of soil both as a component of the ecosystem and within the carbon cycle. The success of the implementation of this sequence was tested using an initial and final test. The results of these tests showed a general improvement (42.8 points in the final test vs 23.3 in the initial test) in relation to the concepts tested. However, differences were observed in relation to the progression done by the students, which was better for ecosystems than for soil, likely as a consequence of the poor previous knowledge. From those results, we conclude that the development of educational tools that allow secondary school students to address real cases in which the soil is considered as a key component of the ecosystem can be effective in moving towards meaningful learning about soils and soil properties, since these seem still poorly understood by secondary school students.

TI  - A Nitrate-Transforming Bacterial Community Dominates in the Miscanthus Rhizosphere on Nitrogen-Deficient Volcanic Deposits of Miyake-jima
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - The perennial gramineous grass Miscanthus condensatus functions as a major pioneer plant in colonizing acidic volcanic deposits on Miyake-jima, Japan, despite a lack of nitrogen nutrients. The nitrogen cycle in the rhizosphere is important for the vigorous growth of M. condensatus in this unfavorable environment. In the present study, we identified the nitrogen-cycling bacterial community in the M. condensatus rhizosphere on these volcanic deposits using a combination of metagenomics and culture-based analyses. Our results showed a large number of functional genes related to denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) in the rhizosphere, indicating that nitrate-transforming bacteria dominated the rhizosphere biome. Furthermore, nitrite reductase genes (i.e., nirK and nirS) related to the denitrification and those genes related to DNRA (i.e., nirB and nrfA) were mainly annotated to the classes Alpha-proteobacteria, Beta-proteobacteria, and Gamma-proteobacteria. A total of 304 nitrate-succinate-stimulated isolates were obtained from the M. condensatus rhizosphere and were classified into 34 operational taxonomic units according to amplified 16S rRNA gene restriction fragment pattern analysis. Additionally, two strains belonging to the genus Cupriavidus in the class Beta-proteobacteria showed a high in vitro denitrifying activity; however, metagenomic results indicated that the DNRA-related rhizobacteria appeared to take a major role in the nitrogen cycle of the M. condensatus rhizosphere in recent Miyake-jima volcanic deposits. This study elucidates the association between the Miscanthus rhizosphere and the nitrate-reducing bacterial community on newly placed volcanic deposits, which furthers our understanding of the transformation of nitrogen nutrition involved in the early development of vegetation.

TI  - Response of soil greenhouse gas fluxes to warming: A global meta-analysis of field studies
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Climate warming is predicted to stimulate soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. A growing number of field studies have investigated the effect of warming on GHG fluxes, but the global responses and temperature sensitivities of all three major biogenic GHGs (CO2, CH4 and N2O) to warming and the potential driving factors have not been well synthesized across different biomes. We conducted a meta-analysis of 2423 globally obtained observations across multiple terrestrial ecosystems (i.e., forest, shrubland, grassland, wetland, cropland and tundra) from 224 published studies. Globally, experimental warming significantly stimulated soil GHG fluxes; soil CO2 and N2O emissions increased by 9.9% and 17.9%, respectively, and CH(4 )emissions in the lowland regions and CH4 uptakes in the upland regions increased by 10.1% and 7.5%, respectively, under warming. These increases amounted to 2289.0 kg, 31.0 kg, and 0.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions and 1.1 kg ha(-1) year (-1)of CH(4 )uptake per 1 degrees C globally, which translates to an additional emission of 30.3 Pg CO2 and 2.3 Pg CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) of CH4 and N2O fluxes from terrestrial ecosystems annually under 1 degrees C warming scenarios. We found that the responses and temperature sensitivities of GHG fluxes to warming were highly biome-dependent, and climate and warming duration also impacted the responses and temperature sensitivities of GHG fluxes. Moreover, warming also affected plant biomass, soil moisture, soil microbial substrate availability, and microbial biomass and function, and changes in soil moisture and plant biomass were related to the changes in GHG fluxes under warming. Our results provide strong empirical support that warming significantly increases soil GHG emissions and aboveground biomass but has no effect on soil carbon. Studies focus only on soil GHG fluxes, with no measurements of soil and plant carbon response, would overestimate the net impact of warming on the terrestrial carbon budget.

TI  - Carbon stocks of trees killed by bark beetles and wildfire in the western United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Forests are major components of the carbon cycle, and disturbances are important influences of forest carbon. Our objective was to contribute to the understanding of forest carbon cycling by quantifying the amount of carbon in trees killed by two disturbance types, fires and bark beetles, in the western United States in recent decades. We combined existing spatial data sets of forest biomass, burn severity, and beetle-caused tree mortality to estimate the amount of aboveground and belowground carbon in killed trees across the region. We found that during 1984-2010, fires killed trees that contained 5-11 Tg C year(-1) and during 1997-2010, beetles killed trees that contained 2-24 Tg C year(-1), with more trees killed since 2000 than in earlier periods. Over their periods of record, amounts of carbon in trees killed by fires and by beetle outbreaks were similar, and together these disturbances killed trees representing 9% of the total tree carbon in western forests, a similar amount to harvesting. Fires killed more trees in lower-elevation forest types such as Douglas-fir than higher-elevation forest types, whereas bark beetle outbreaks also killed trees in higher-elevation forest types such as lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce. Over 15% of the carbon in lodgepole pine and spruce/fir forest types was in trees killed by beetle outbreaks; other forest types had 5-10% of the carbon in killed trees. Our results document the importance of these natural disturbances in the carbon budget of the western United States.

TI  - Biotic and abiotic factors affecting soil microbial carbon use efficiency
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Soil microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) refers to the efficiency of microorganisms in converting absorbed carbon into their own biomass carbon. Soil microbial CUE is a key parameter to understanding the soil carbon cycle. Biotic and abiotic factors are widely considered to be important factors influencing CUE. However, the related underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This review elaborates on the concept of soil microbial CUE and the various approaches used for its measurement. We reviewed the effects of various abiotic factors, such as temperature, soil moisture, pH, nutrient addition, and substrate type, and biotic factors, such as microbial community structure and diversity, on CUE. Finally, we discussed the focus areas that future studies need to further explore. We hope this review can provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors impacting soil microbial CUE, which is a fundamental step to improving soil carbon storage capacity.

TI  - Effects of biochar additions on the soil chemical properties, bacterial community structure and rape growth in an acid purple soil
T2  - PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Biochar is considered as a universal conditioner to improve soil quality, but its effects of different addition rates on soil properties, bacterial community structure and plant growth are still unclear, particularly in the typical acid purple soil in the southwest of China. In this study, 110 days of rape growth pot experiment under the application rate of 0.0% rice husk biochar (CK), 0.8% (CT1), 2.0% (CT2) and 4.0% (CT3) to the acid purple soil. Results showed that all biochar additions improved soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), total phosphorus, available phosphorus, available potassium concentrations in the acid purple soil. The activity of both invertase and catalase, not urease, was significantly increased with the increasing of biochar addition rates. The 16s-gene sequencing results showed that the Chao1 index was increased only under CT3, and the Shannon index was increased after all biochar applications. Furthermore, biochar increased the relative abundance of bacteria that play important roles in soil carbon and nitrogen cycles, SOC decomposition, plant diseases control and growth. The plant height and biomass production of rapes were increased under the low biochar level (CT1), but not under the higher rates of CT2 and CT3. These results demonstrated that biochar, as a soil conditioner to the acid purple soil, could increase soil pH value, SOC, available phosphorus and potassium and affect carbon and nitrogen cycles related to bacterial communities for promoting plant performance under low application rate.

TI  - Characterization, Quantification and Compound-specific Isotopic Analysis of Pyrogenic Carbon Using Benzene Polycarboxylic Acids (BPCA)
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
AB  - Fire-derived, pyrogenic carbon (PyC), sometimes called black carbon (BC), is the carbonaceous solid residue of biomass and fossil fuel combustion, such as char and soot. PyC is ubiquitous in the environment due to its long persistence, and its abundance might even increase with the projected increase in global wildfire activity and the continued burning of fossil fuel. PyC is also increasingly produced from the industrial pyrolysis of organic wastes, which yields charred soil amendments (biochar). Moreover, the emergence of nanotechnology may also result in the release of PyC-like compounds to the environment. It is thus a high priority to reliably detect, characterize and quantify these charred materials in order to investigate their environmental properties and to understand their role in the carbon cycle.
   Here, we present the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) method, which allows the simultaneous assessment of PyC's characteristics, quantity and isotopic composition (C-13 and C-14) on a molecular level. The method is applicable to a very wide range of environmental sample materials and detects PyC over a broad range of the combustion continuum, i.e., it is sensitive to slightly charred biomass as well as high temperature chars and soot. The BPCA protocol presented here is simple to employ, highly reproducible, as well as easily extendable and modifiable to specific requirements. It thus provides a versatile tool for the investigation of PyC in various disciplines, ranging from archeology and environmental forensics to biochar and carbon cycling research.

TI  - Protists as catalyzers of microbial litter breakdown and carbon cycling at different temperature regimes
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - Soil bacteria and fungi are key drivers of carbon released from soils to the atmosphere through decomposition of plant-derived organic carbon sources. This process has important consequences for the global climate. While global change factors, such as increased temperature, are known to affect bacterial- and fungal-mediated decomposition rates, the role of trophic interactions in affecting decomposition remains largely unknown. We designed synthetic microbial communities consisting of eight bacterial and eight fungal species and tested the influence of predation by a model protist,Physarum polycephalum, on litter breakdown at 17 and 21 degrees C. Protists increased CO2 release and litter mass loss by similar to 35% at 17 degrees C lower temperatures, while they only had minor effects on microbial-driven CO2 release and mass loss at 21 degrees C. We found species-specific differences in predator-prey interactions, which may affect microbial community composition and functioning and thus underlie the impact of protists on litter breakdown. Our findings suggest that microbial predation by fast-growing protists is of under-appreciated functional importance, as it affects decomposition and, as such, may influence global carbon dynamics. Our results indicate that we need to better understand the role of trophic interactions within the microbiome in controlling decomposition processes and carbon cycling.

TI  - ASSESSING BRAZIL CARBON BUDGET .1. BIOTIC CARBON POOLS
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Brazil contains the world's largest expanse of tropical forest, but its forests are experiencing high levels of conversion to other uses. There is concern that releases of CO2 and other greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation will contribute to global climate change, The total amount of C that could be released by deforestation depends upon the amount currently contained in the terrestrial biota and soils. Knowledge of the areas of Brazil's major ecosystems and land use types and their C densities was used to estimate the total amount of C stored in vegetation, litter and coarse woody debris, and soils, The total estimated C pools were (58-81) X 10(9) Mg C in vegetation, (6-9) X 10(9) Mg C in litter and coarse woody debris, and about 72 X 10(9) Mg C in soil. Over 80% of the vegetation pool was contained in the closed tropical moist forests of Brazil.

TI  - Microbial Life History Mediates the Drought-Induced Decrease in Wood Decomposition in Subtropical Forests
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - Progressive intensification of drought regimes worldwide threatens wood decomposition - a critical biogeochemical process in forest carbon cycling. However, the interactions between microbial strategies, wood traits and microclimate in regulating wood decomposition remain poorly understood under drought conditions. In a throughfall exclusion experiment (control 35% and 70% rainfall reduction) across 12 tree species, we found that drought-induced reductions in wood CO2 efflux rates were primarily driven by wood traits (density and carbon reduction) and shifts in fungal K/r-strategies. Coarse wood debris with higher Basidiomycota and lower Ascomycota abundance decomposed faster. Significant positive correlations were observed between fungal K/r-strategies and wood CO2 efflux under control, 35%, and 70% rainfall reduction, while bacterial strategies showed no correlation. Our findings highlight the greater drought sensitivity of fungi than bacteria, emphasising their critical role in forest carbon dynamics and informing carbon models to improve the prediction of climate-biosphere feedback in the changing world.

TI  - The Effects of Preservatives on Antibiotic- and Preservative-Resistant Microbes and Nitrogen/Sulfur Cycle Associated Microbial Communities in Freshwater River Sediments
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
AB  - The intensive use of benzoic acid (BA), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HB), and dehydroacetate (DHA) as additives and preservatives in cosmetics and foods causes emerging environmental pollutions. Anthropogenic releases of BA, HB and DHA are primarily emissions into water and soil. However, few studies investigate the effects of BA, HB and DHA on microbial communities in freshwater river sediments. The aim of this study is to reveal the effects of BA, HB and DHA on microbial communities in freshwater river sediments. Tetracycline-, sulfamethoxazole- and preservative-resistant microbes were increased in the river sediments treated with BA, HB and DHA. The relative abundances of methanogen- and xenobiotic-degradation-associated microbial communities were also increased in the BA-, HB- and DHA-treated sediments. The relative abundance of four nitrogen cycle associated microbial groups (anammox, nitrogen fixation, denitrification, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction) were increased after the eighth week in the BA-, HB- and DHA-treated sediments. For the sulfur cycle, the relative abundance of thiosulfate oxidation associated microbial communities were increased after the eighth week in the BA-, HB- and DHA-treated sediments. Results of this study provide insight into the effects of BA, HB and DHA on antibiotic resistance, nitrogen cycle, sulfur cycle, drug resistance and methane production in freshwater aquatic environments.

TI  - PROCESSES REGULATING SOIL EMISSIONS OF NO AND N2O IN A SEASONALLY DRY TROPICAL FOREST
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - While much is known about control of production of NO and N2O by nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria at the cellular level, application of this knowledge to field studies has not yielded unifying concepts that are widely applicable and that foster understanding of global sources of these atmospheric trace gases. We applied a simple conceptual model to the investigation of sources of NO and N2O and the environmental factors affecting fluxes in a drought-deciduous forest of Mexico.
   Fluxes of NO and N2O were higher in the wet season than the dry season, but addition of water to dry soil caused large pulses of CO2, NO, and N2O emissions. Immediate increases of extractable soil NH4+ and high rates of gross N mineralization and gross nitrification also were observed following wetting of dry soil. Soil NO2- had accumulated during the dry season, and that NO2- plus the pulse of increased soil NH4+ were mostly consumed within 24 hours of wetting. This dynamic microbial processing of soil inorganic N coincided with the pulses of NO and N2O production following wetting of dry soil.
   Acetylene inhibition experiments indicated that NO production was dependent on nitrification, that nitrification was the dominant source of N2O when the soil was wetted at the end of the dry season, and that denitrification might be an important source of N2O during the wet season. Post-wetting soil moisture was correlated negatively with NO fluxes and positively with N2O fluxes. These results support a conceptual model in which N trace gas production is generally constrained by the rates of N mineralization and nitrification, while the specific ratios of NO and N2O fluxes and the contributions from nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria are controlled largely by soil moisture.

TI  - Nitrogen-cycling genes and rhizosphere microbial community with reduced nitrogen application in maize/soybean strip intercropping
T2  - NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Soil microbes are essential links between above- and below-ground ecosystems and play an important role in regulating ecological functions in the soil. Dynamic interactions within the soil-microbial community in a cereal-legume intercropping ecosystem influence the composition and structure of N-cycling microbial groups (e.g. nitrogen-fixing bacteria). However, these effects have not been extensively studied in some intercropping patterns or in response to varying nitrogen fertilization levels. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of reduced and conventional nitrogen application in a sweet maize (Zea may L.)/soybean (Glycine max L.) strip intercropping system under three cropping patterns over a 3-year time period. High-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR techniques were used to investigate changes to both the microbial community structure and the expression of key nitrogen-cycling genes in the rhizosphere. Our results indicate that reduced nitrogen application affected the microbial community structure in the rhizosphere, but microbial diversity in the sweet maize rhizosphere was relatively stable. Both the abundance and activity of functional marker genes for microbial nitrogen fixation (nifH), nitrification (amoA), denitrification (nirS, nirK, nosZ), and decomposition (chiA) increased significantly from 2013 to 2016. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the quantified shifts in the soil microbial community and the observed increases in the expression of key functional genes involved in N-cycling were the result of reduced nitrogen application in this strip intercropping system. This study, therefore, provides essential insight into the potential relationships between functional nitrogen-cycling genes and mitigation of nitrogen-loss and N2O emissions in a cereal-legume strip intercropping system.

TI  - Global nitrogen input on wetland ecosystem: The driving mechanism of soil labile carbon and nitrogen on greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ECOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands are significantly promoted by global nitrogen input for changing the rate of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, and are substantially affected by soil labile carbon and nitrogen conversely. However, the driving mechanism by which soil labile carbon and nitrogen affect greenhouse gas emissions from wetland ecosystems under global nitrogen input is not well understood. Working out the driving factor of nitrogen input on greenhouse gas emissions from wetlands is critical to reducing global warming from nitrogen input. Thus, we synthesized 72 published studies (2144 paired observations) of greenhouse gas fluxes and soil labile compounds of carbon and nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, soil microbial biomass nitrogen and carbon), to understand the effects of labile carbon and nitrogen on greenhouse gas emissions under global nitrogen input. Across the data set, nitrogen input significantly promoted carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from wetlands. In particular, at lower nitrogen rates (<100 kg ha(-1).yr(-1)) and with added ammonium compounds, freshwater wetland significantly promoted carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Peatland was the largest nitrous oxide source under these conditions. This meta-analysis also revealed that nitrogen input stimulated dissolved organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, microbial biomass carbon and microbial biomass nitrogen accumulation in the wetland ecosystem. The variation-partitioning analysis and structural equation model were used to analyze the relationship between the greenhouse gas and labile carbon and nitrogen further. These results revealed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the primary factor driving greenhouse gas emission from wetlands under global nitrogen input, whereas microbial biomass carbon (MBC) more directly affects greenhouse gas emission than other labile carbon and nitrogen.

TI  - Soil fertility relates to fungal-mediated decomposition and organic matter turnover in a temperate mountain forest
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Fungi are known to exert a significant influence over soil organic matter (SOM) turnover, however understanding of the effects of fungal community structure on SOM dynamics and its consequences for ecosystem fertility is fragmentary.
   Here we studied soil fungal guilds and SOM decomposition processes along a fertility gradient in a temperate mountain beech forest. High-throughput sequencing was used to investigate fungal communities. Carbon and nitrogen stocks, enzymatic activity and microbial respiration were measured.
   While ectomycorrhizal fungal abundance was not related to fertility, saprotrophic ascomycetes showed higher relative abundances under more fertile conditions. The activity of oxidising enzymes and respiration rates in mineral soil were related positively to fertility and saprotrophic fungi. In addition, organic layer carbon and nitrogen stocks were lower on the more fertile plots, although tree biomass and litter input were higher. Together, the results indicated a faster SOM turnover at the fertile end of the gradient.
   We suggest that there is a positive feedback mechanism between SOM turnover and fertility that is mediated by soil fungi to a significant extent. By underlining the importance of fungi for soil fertility and plant growth, these findings furthermore emphasise the dependency of carbon cycling on fungal communities below ground.

TI  - Effects of heavy metals on microbial communities in sediments and establishment of bioindicators based on microbial taxa and function for environmental monitoring and management
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Heavy metals have always been a research hotspol clue to their persistence, hazard and bioaccumulation. Microorganisms are highly sensitive to heavy metal pollution and play an important role in the material cycling and energy flow of the ecosystem. In order to further explore the influence of heavy metals on the diversity, composition, and function of microbial communities in the wetland sediment ecosystem, and to find suitable indicators to reflect heavy metal pollution status, we collected sediments from Huangjinxia nature reserve and determined the physicochemical properties, heavy metal (Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Mn) concentrations, and microbial information. We found that: the contamination status of the study area stood at a moderate level evaluated by the pollution load index (PL1); heavy metals explained more of microbial community variation than the sediment physicochemical properties; in particular, Cr and Mn negatively affected microbial u-diversity; heavy metals significantly affected the structure of microbial communities, elements Cr, Pb, and Zn showed uniformly negative associations with the relative abundance of bacteria Nitrospirae (including class Nitrospira and order Nitrospirales), Bacteroidetes (including class Bucteroidiu), and Verracomicrobia; moreover, heavy metals affected predicted functions of microbial communities, including metabolic functions, genetic information processes, and functions related to the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. Based on the relative abundance of sensitive microbial taxa and predicted functions, bioindicators [Bacteroidial, 1;Nitrospiral, 1/fNitnficationl, and 1/I-Aerobic nitrite oxidation;were established to reflect and predict the contamination status of heavy metals in sediments. Our in-depth research on the effects of heavy metals on microorganisms and the establishment of bioindicators provide references and new perspectives for environmental monitoring and management.

TI  - The effect of the soil-feeding termite Cubitermes niokoloensis on soil microbial activity in a semi-arid savanna in West Africa
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Soil-feeding termite mounds are an important, highly specific soil microbial compartment in semi-arid savannas. The aim of this study was to determine the role of these mounds in organic matter dynamics, taking the soil nitrogen cycle as representative of microbial mediated activity. Measures of microbial activity (soil respiration) and aspects of the nitrogen cycle (arginine ammonification, nitrification and denitrification) were made in the mound of Cubitermes niokoloensis, a representative species of the soil-feeding guild in dry savanna. Simultaneous measurements were made of mineral nitrogen concentration, total bacterial count (using AODC) and denitrifying and nitrifying bacterial densities. All measurements were made in two different compartments of the mound, the internal and external walls. Although organic matter was richer and there was a significant higher density of bacteria in the internal wall of the mound (by a factor of 2), the metabolic activity in this compartment was not significantly different from the surrounding savanna soil. This was not true for the external wall of the mound, suggesting that there was a difference in oxygen availability between these two compartments. Compared to the reference savanna soil, the mound was a hot spot of mineral nitrogen (100-times NH4+ and 50-times NO3-) representing 25% of the total nitrogen content of the mound, compared with only 2% in the savanna soil. This high level of mineral nitrogen was associated with a higher density of denitrifying bacteria and increased denitrification and ammonification potentials (3 and 4 times, respectively) in the mound compartments compared with the reference soil. However, the specific activity of the denitrifying bacteria was lower in the internal wall of the mound than in the reference soil. Also, no potential nitrification was observed in the mound, demonstrating a serious perturbation of the nitrogen cycle induced by the soil-feeding termite C. niokoloensis in the sandy savanna soil, with, as a consequence, an enrichment in organic matter and nutrients for plants. This study reinforces the view of termites as soil engineers in semi-arid savannas, modifying their environment in both of its biotic and abiotic components.

TI  - Distinct pattern of nitrogen functional gene abundances in top- and subsoils along a 120,000-year ecosystem development gradient
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Soil microorganisms are key players of the nitrogen cycle and relevant for soil development. While the community structure of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms during initial soil development is already well investigated, knowledge about the patterns during long-term ecosystem development is limited. In this study, nitrogen functional genes of ammonia-oxidizers (amoA), nitrate-reducers (narG), and chitin-degraders (chiA) were determined via quantitative PCR and the functional community composition of archaeal ammonia-oxidizers was analyzed via clone libraries and DNA sequencing (amoA) in soil depth profiles along the 120,000-year Franz Josef chronosequence (New Zealand). The results show that absolute nitrogen functional gene abundances change significantly during long-term soil development. In organic layers, narG and chiA gene abundances were highest in young to intermediate-aged soils and then decreased following progressive and retrogressive development of the vegetation. While relative archaeal amoA gene abundance (proportional to total cell counts) decreased in the oldest phosphorus-limited topsoils, relative narG and chiA gene abundances remained constant. In subsoils, archaeal amoA and narG gene abundances also decreased with ecosystem retrogression that coincided with the increasing content of iron and aluminum oxides as well as other clay-sized minerals. In contrast, subsoil chiA gene abundances were hardly affected by soil age. The analysis of the archaeal amoA community revealed a compositional shift during long-term ecosystem development. Our study provides evidence that the community structure of nitrogen-cycling microorganisms in top- and subsoils is significantly affected by long-term ecosystem development and suggests an important role of the mineral phase in subsoils.

TI  - The connection between the antibiotic resistome and nitrogen-cycling microorganisms in paddy soil is enhanced by application of chemical and plant-derived organic fertilizers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) present significant risks to environments and public health. In particular, there is increasing awareness of the role of soil nitrogen in ARG dissemination. Here, we investigated the connections between antibiotic resistome and nitrogen-cycling microbes in paddy soil by performing five-year field experiments with the treatments of no nitrogen fertilization (CK), reduced chemical nitrogen fertilization (LN), conventional chemical nitrogen fertilization (CN) and plant-derived organic nitrogen fertilization (ON). Compared with CK treatment, CN and ON treatments significantly increased soil NH4+ and TN concentrations by 25.4%- 56.5% and 10.4%-20.1%, respectively. Redundancy analysis revealed significantly positive correlation of NH4+ with most ARGs, including tetA, macB and barA. Correspondingly, CN and ON treatments enhanced ARG abundances by 21.9%-23.2%. Moreover, CN and ON treatments promoted nitrate/nitrite-reducing bacteria and linked the corresponding N-cycling functional genes (narG, narH, nirK and nrfA) with most ARGs. Metagenomic binning was performed and identified Gemmatimonadaceae, Caulobacteraceae, Ilumatobacteraceae and Anaerolineaceae as hosts for both ARGs and nitrate/nitrite reduction genes that were enriched by CN and ON treatments. Soil resistome risk score analysis indicated that, although there was increased relation of ARG to nitrogen-cycling microorganisms with nitrogen fertilizer application, the environmental risk of ARGs was not increased due to the lower distribution of ARGs in pathogens. This study contributed to a deeper understanding of the role of soil nitrogen in shaping ARG profiles and controlling soil resistome risk.

TI  - Selective influence of cyflumetofen in degradation and ecological risk assessment
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Pesticide pollution has gradually caused land degradation. In order to avoid this problem, it is recommended to use enantiomeric pesticides that have less impact on the soil. Cyflumetofen's (CYF) microecological environmental assessment at the enantiomer level is unclear. In our study, the degradation of CYF enantiomers and the effect on soil functions are closely related to microorganisms. (+)-CYF enantiomer is degradable preferred and further discovered that related microorganism that degrades enantiomers. CYF enantiomers alter the bacteria structure and decreased the bacteria abundance. The combination of high-throughput and quantitative PCR results showed that the diversity of the (+)-CYF treatment was significantly lower than that of the (-)-CYF (-30.41 to 44.60) treatment, and the (+)-CYF treatment (-27.80% to 56.70%) was more capable of causing the decrease in the number of soil microorganisms. In addition, (+)-CYF severely interferes with nitrogen cycling-related functions. Furthermore, the soil microbial structure was changed to its original level by enantiomers posed. In the study of nitrogen cycle functions, we found that both enantiomers can restrain the abundance of nitrogen cycle-related genes, especially the (+)-CYF treatment decreased more. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that g-Massilia and g-Arthrobacter are closely related to nitrogen fixation genes and nitrification genes, and degradation of the two enantiomers of CYF by g-Arthrobacter is closely related. The biological effects of CYF enantiomers remain unclear. Bioassay results show that enantiomers have similar virulence to Tetranychus cinnabarinus. Therefore, while achieving the prevention and control effect, the use of a single isomer (+)-CYF has a higher potential risk to the soil ecosystem.

TI  - Proteomic insights into Methanobactin barkers under polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon stress: Enhanced nutrients uptake and aceticlastic methanogenesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Anaerobic methanogens play a critical role in global carbon cycling and the production of methane, a valuable clean energy source. However, with industrialization, the accumulation of fluoranthene (Flu) in sediments, soils, and sewage treatment plants has raised concerns about its potential impact on methane production by methanogens. In this paper, the effect of Flu on Methanosarcina barkeri (M. barkeri) was investigated. Methane production at 0.01 and 0.1 mg/L Flu was 1.4-and 1.7-fold higher than that of the control, respectively. The growth of M. barkeri peaked at 0.1 mg/L Flu, reaching 1.4 times that of the control. At this concentration, the physiological characteristics of M. barkeri were enhanced, including cell viability (154 %), total extracellular polymer (1.8-fold), and superoxide dismutase enzyme activity (1.3-fold). Remarkably, TMT-based proteomic analysis revealed that methanogenesis-related metabolic pathways and nutrient uptake of M. barkeri were upregulated under Flu exposure. Specifically, ABC transport proteins involved in the uptake of iron (III), zinc, molybdenum, and vitamin B12 (ModA/C, ZnuA/B/C, and BtuC) were upregulated by 3.1-, 4.5-, and 1.3-fold, respectively, thereby enhancing nutrient availability. In addition, the expression of MtrA/C/D/E/G/H (8.2-fold), FrhA/B/G, and Mcr proteins, which are associated with the groups of methyltransferases, coenzyme F420 hydrogenase, and methane reduction, was significantly increased, promoting the activity of enzymes related to aceticlastic methanogenesis in the presence of Flu. Overall, this study sheds light on the effects of organic contaminants on the global carbon cycle participated by M. barkeri from the molecular biology perspective.

TI  - The influence of trees, shrubs, and grasses on microclimate, soil carbon, nitrogen, and CO2 efflux: Potential implications of shrub encroachment for Kalahari rangelands
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Shrub encroachment is a well-documented phenomenon affecting many of the world's drylands. The alteration of vegetation structure and species composition can lead to changes in local microclimate and soil properties which in turn affect carbon cycling. The objectives of this paper were to quantify differences in air temperatures, soil carbon, nitrogen, and CO2 efflux under trees (Vachellia erioloba), shrubs (Grewia flava), and annual and perennial grasses (Schmidtia kalahariensis and Eragrostis lehmanniana) collected over three seasons at a site in Kgalagadi District, Botswana, in order to determine the vegetation-soil feedback mechanism affecting the carbon cycle. Air temperatures were logged continuously, and soil CO2 efflux was determined throughout the day and evening using closed respiration chambers and an infrared gas analyser. There were significant differences in soil carbon, total nitrogen, CO2 efflux, light, and temperatures beneath the canopies of trees, shrubs, and grasses. Daytime air temperatures beneath shrubs and trees were cooler compared with grass sites, particularly in summer months. Night-time air temperatures under shrubs and trees were, however, warmer than at the grass sites. There was also significantly more soil carbon, nitrogen, and CO2 efflux under shrubs and trees compared with grasses. Although the differences observed in soils and microclimate may reinforce the competitive dominance of shrubs and present challenges to strategies designed to manage encroachment, they should not be viewed as entirely negative. Our findings highlight some of the dichotomies and challenges to be addressed before interventions aiming to bring about more sustainable land management can be implemented.

TI  - Diversity and spatial distribution of sediment ammonia-oxidizing crenarchaeota in response to estuarine and environmental gradients in the Changjiang Estuary and East China Sea
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY-SGM
AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) have recently been found to be potentially important in nitrogen cycling in a variety of environments, such as terrestrial soils, wastewater treatment reactors, marine waters and sediments, and especially in estuaries, where high input of anthropogenic nitrogen is often experienced. The sedimentary AOA diversity, community structure and spatial distribution in the Changjiang Estuary and the adjacent East China Sea were studied. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that the archaeal amoA genotype communities could be clustered according to sampling transects, and the station located in an estuarine mixing zone harboured a distinct AOA community. The distribution of AOA communities correlated significantly with the gradients of surface-water salinity and sediment sorting coefficient. The spatial distribution of putative soil-related AOA in certain sampling stations indicated a strong impact of the Changjiang freshwater discharge on the marine benthic microbial ecosystem. Besides freshwater, nutrients, organic matter and suspended particles, the Changjiang Diluted Water might also contribute to the transport of terrestrial archaea into the seawater and sediments along its flow path.

TI  - Can microplastics mediate soil properties, plant growth and carbon/nitrogen turnover in the terrestrial ecosystem?
T2  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution, a global environmental problem, has been recently studied in marine and freshwater environments. However, our understanding of MP effect on terrestrial ecosystems, especially carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) turnover remains poor. This review summarizes the sources and distribution characteristics of MPs in terrestrial ecosystems and explores their effects on soil properties, plant growth, C and N turnover. Once entering the terrestrial ecosystem, MPs could involve in sequestrating carbon and nitrogen by changing soil properties (e.g., pH, soil aggregate stability, and soil porosity). MPs could exert direct influences on plants or on soil physical environment and microbial metabolic environment to indirectly affect plant growth, thus altering the quantity and quality of soil C and N inputs by shifts in plant litter and roots. The changes of the dominant bacteria phyla, related functional genes, and enzymes caused by MP pollution could affect C and N cycles. Additionally, the MP effect varies with its properties (e.g., types, shapes, elemental composition, functional groups, released additives). Future researches should unify the standard system of MP separation, detection, and reveal the ecological effects of MPs, especially their impacts on terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles in the context of climate changes.

TI  - Soil Formate Regulates the Fungal Nitrous Oxide Emission Pathway
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Fungal activity is a major driver in the global nitrogen cycle, and mounting evidence suggests that fungal denitrification activity contributes significantly to soil emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). The metabolic pathway and oxygen requirement for fungal denitrification are different from those for bacterial denitrification. We hypothesized that the soil N2O emission from fungi is formate and O-2 dependent and that land use and landforms could influence the proportion of N2O coming from fungi. Using substrate-induced respiration inhibition under anaerobic and aerobic conditions in combination with N-15 gas analysis, we found that formate and hypoxia (versus anaerobiosis) were essential for the fungal reduction of N-15-labeled nitrate to (N2O)-N-15. As much as 65% of soil-emitted N2O was attributable to fungi; however, this was found only in soils from water-accumulating landforms. From these results, we hypothesize that plant root exudates could affect N2O production from fungi via the proposed formate-dependent pathway.

TI  - Groundwater Depth Overrides Tree-Species Effects on the Structure of Soil Microbial Communities Involved in Nitrogen Cycling in Plantation Forests
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Microbial communities found in soil ecosystems play important roles in decomposing organic materials and recycling nutrients. A clear understanding on how biotic and abiotic factors influence the microbial community and its functional role in ecosystems is fundamental to terrestrial biogeochemistry and plant production. The purpose of this study was to investigate microbial communities and functional genes involved in nitrogen cycling as a function of groundwater depth (deep and shallow), tree species (pine and eucalypt), and season (spring and fall). Soil fungal, bacterial, and archaeal communities were determined by length heterogeneity polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR). Soil ammonia oxidation archaeal (AOA) amoA gene, ammonia oxidation bacterial (AOB) amoA gene, nitrite oxidoreductase nrxA gene, and denitrifying bacterial narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ genes were further studied using PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Soil fungal and bacterial communities remained similar between tree species and groundwater depths, respectively, regardless of season. Soil archaeal communities remained similar between tree species but differed between groundwater depths in the spring only. Archaeal amoA for nitrification and bacterial nirK and nosZ genes for denitrification were detected in DGGE, whereas bacterial amoA and nrxA for nitrification and bacterial narG and nirS genes for denitrification were undetectable. The detected nitrification and denitrification communities varied significantly with groundwater depth. There was no significant difference of nitrifying archaeal amoA or denitrifying nirK communities between different tree species regardless of season. The seasonal difference in microbial communities and functional genes involved in nitrogen cycling suggests microorganisms exhibit seasonal dynamics that likely impact relative rates of nitrification and denitrification.

TI  - Warming and drying suppress microbial activity and carbon cycling in boreal forest soils
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Climate warming is expected to have particularly strong effects on tundra and boreal ecosystems, yet relatively few studies have examined soil responses to temperature change in these systems. We used closed-top greenhouses to examine the response of soil respiration, nutrient availability, microbial abundance, and active fungal communities to soil warming in an Alaskan boreal forest dominated by mature black spruce. This treatment raised soil temperature by 0.5 degrees C and also resulted in a 22% decline in soil water content. We hypothesized that microbial abundance and activity would increase with the greenhouse treatment. Instead, we found that bacterial and fungal abundance declined by over 50%, and there was a trend toward lower activity of the chitin-degrading enzyme N-acetyl-glucosaminidase. Soil respiration also declined by up to 50%, but only late in the growing season. These changes were accompanied by significant shifts in the community structure of active fungi, with decreased relative abundance of a dominant Thelephoroid fungus and increased relative abundance of Ascomycetes and Zygomycetes in response to warming. In line with our hypothesis, we found that warming marginally increased soil ammonium and nitrate availability as well as the overall diversity of active fungi. Our results indicate that rising temperatures in northern-latitude ecosystems may not always cause a positive feedback to the soil carbon cycle, particularly in boreal forests with drier soils. Models of carbon cycle-climate feedbacks could increase their predictive power by incorporating heterogeneity in soil properties and microbial communities across the boreal zone.

TI  - Plant Invasion Increases Soil Microbial Biomass Carbon: Meta-Analysis and Empirical Tests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a vital component of the global carbon cycle. SOC influences soil fertility and structure and is controlled by various factors, including land use, land management practices, and climate change. Biological invasion is a significant yet controversial factor that can alter SOC levels. We conducted a meta-analysis of 445 observations from 61 published reports and followed up with field surveys to clarify the impact of plant invasion on SOC. Our results indicated that plant invasion leads to a 29% increase in microbial biomass carbon (MBC), which is one of the key fractions of SOC. Specifically, among different ecosystems, plant invasion caused MBC increases of 59% in estuaries, 59% in alluvial land, 53% in wetlands, and 80% in orchards. Furthermore, invasion by plants from the Asteraceae family resulted in a 33% increase in MBC, whereas invasion by plants from the Lythraceae family caused a 72% increase in MBC. Our field survey also revealed that plant invasion elevated the soil MBC content relative to the occurrence of native plants or bare ground. Overall, these findings suggest that plant invasion impacts soil carbon, especially by increasing MBC, which may in turn affect future invasions. These effects are influenced by the type of invasive species, ecosystem type, and soil layer depth, highlighting the complex role of biological invasion in the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Recovery through proper grazing exclusion promotes the carbon cycle and increases carbon sequestration in semiarid steppe
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Grazing exclusion changes soil physical-chemical characteristics, rapidly affects microbial community composition and function, and alters biogeochemical processes, e.g., carbon (C) cycle, over time. However, the temporal dynamics of CO2 emission and CH4 uptake during grassland restoration chronosequences remain poorly understood. We inves-tigated soil CO2 emission and CH4 uptake, the genes related to CO2 and CH4 production and reduction (cbbL, cbbM, chiA, and pmoA), and associated microbial communities under different durations of grazing exclusion (0, 7, 16, 25, and 38 years) to reveal the mechanisms and potential of soil CO2 emission and CH4 uptake in a semi-arid steppe. The results showed that a proper exclusion period could significantly improve soil physical-chemical conditions, veg-etation community, and soil C-cycling. The abundance of C-cycling functional genes (cbbL, cbbM, chiA and pmoA), CH4 uptake and CO2 emission rates showed a single-peak pattern with increasing duration of grazing exclusion, peaking at 16 years and then decreasing in the period between 25 and 38 years, indicating that the effect of exclusion weakened when the exclusion period was too long. The changes in C-cycling functional genes and microbial communities are pri-marily influenced by aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), and are associated with CO2, CH4, soil water con-tent (SWC), and soil organic carbon (SOC). Structural equation modeling showed that increases in SOC content and pmoA abundance caused by an increase in ANPP accelerated CO2 emission and CH4 uptake rates, respectively. Our re-sults provide valuable insights into the critical role of grazing exclusion in promoting grassland restoration and carbon sequestration, and have potential implications for sustainable land management practices.

TI  - Metagenomic Insights into the Enhancement of Bioavailable Nitrogen in Continuous Cropping Soil Through the Application of Traditional Chinese Medicine Residue Following Fumigation
T2  - GENES
AB  - Background/Objectives: Chemical fumigation can effectively inhibit the occurrence of soil-borne diseases; however, this approach can negatively affect the structure of the soil microbial community. The combination of soil fumigant and organic fertilizer application thus represents a widely adopted strategy in agricultural practice. Traditional Chinese medicine residue (TCMR) is a high-quality organic fertilizer; however, the impact of post-fumigation TCMR application on keystone taxa and their functional traits remains uncertain. Methods: This study examined the effects of five fertilization treatments on the diversity, key species, and related functional genes of microbial communities in rhizosphere soil of continuous cropping pepper. Results: Chemical fumigation followed by TCMR application markedly enhanced soil nutrient content in the rhizosphere and significantly influenced microbial community composition as well as functional gene patterns associated with microbial nitrogen cycling. It was also strongly correlated with soil bioavailable nitrogen content. The abundance of keystone bacterial species (Pseudomonadota, Actinomycetota, and Bacillota) substantially increased following TCMR application, alongside a notable rise in Ascomycota abundance within the fungal community. This shift contributed to an increase in beneficial bacterial abundance while reducing that of harmful bacteria. Additionally, TCMR addition affected the abundance of denitrification and DNRA genes involved in nitrogen cycling; specifically, nirB and nirK were strongly associated with soil organic nitrogen content. Conclusions: The combined application of chemical fumigants and TCMR modified the composition of keystone microbial community species by influencing rhizosphere soil TN and other nutrients, and these alterations were linked to multiple nitrogen-cycling functional genes.

TI  - Distribution Characteristics of Soil Viruses Under Different Precipitation Gradients on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Viruses are extremely abundant in the soil environment and have potential roles in impacting on microbial population, evolution, and nutrient biogeochemical cycles. However, how environment and climate changes affect soil viruses is still poorly understood. Here, a metagenomic approach was used to investigate the distribution, diversity, and potential biogeochemical impacts of DNA viruses in 12 grassland soils under three precipitation gradients on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is one of the most sensitive areas to climate change. A total of 557 viral operational taxonomic units were obtained, spanning 152 viral families from the 30 metagenomes. Both virus-like particles (VLPs) and microbial abundance increased with average annual precipitation. A significant positive correlation of VLP counts was observed with soil water content, total carbon, total nitrogen, soil organic matter, and total phosphorus. Among these biological and abiotic factors, SWC mainly contributed to the variability in VLP abundance. The order Caudovirales (70.1% of the identified viral order) was the predominant viral type in soils from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, with the Siphoviridae family being the most abundant. Remarkably, abundant auxiliary carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) genes represented by glycoside hydrolases were identified, indicating that soil viruses may play a potential role in the carbon cycle on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. There were more diverse hosts and abundant CAZyme genes in soil with moderate precipitation. Our study provides a strong evidence that changes in precipitation impact not only viral abundance and virus-host interactions in soil but also the viral functional potential, especially carbon cycling.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of the Components of Carbon Cycle in Soils of Forest Ecosystems of the Northern, Middle, and Southern Taiga of Western Siberia
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - In the course of studies in typical forest ecosystems of the northern, middle, and southern taiga of Western Siberia performed at the peak of the growing season, the spatial variation of soil CO2 emissions and their relationships with the content of extractable and microbial soil carbon and soil hydrothermic parameters were estimated. The studied parameters of the soil carbon cycle are characterized by the high spatial variability in all the studied ecosystems. This fact indicates the need for a detailed investigation of the greenhouse gas soil emission in all ecosystems typical of a given natural zone. There is a statistically significant difference between the soils of the green-moss pine forests and the soils of the lichen pine forest of the northern taiga. In the green-moss pine forest, the carbon content of microbial biomass is 1.5 times higher (195 +/- 24 and 127 +/- 16 mg C/kg soil, respectively), the content of extractable carbon is 4 times higher (157 +/- 25 and 41 +/- 5 mg C/kg of soil, respectively), and the CO2 emission is 1.7 times higher (324 +/- 20 and 190 +/- 10 mg CO2/(m(2) h), respectively) than those in the lichen pine forest. In the northern taiga zone, carbon dioxide emissions from soils in the green-moss pine forests are largely determined by the soil temperature; the role of soil moisture is less significant. In the soils of lichen pine forests, the CO2 emission is mainly controlled by the content of extractable carbon. Significant factors influencing the soil CO2 emission in forest ecosystems of the taiga zone are the content of extractable and microbial carbon and hydrothermic parameters of the soils.

TI  - Shift in archaeal community along a soil profile in coastal wheat-maize rotation fields of different reclamation ages
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Coastal mudflats reclamation activities show a strong influence on soil properties and microbial community activity, which drive soil carbon and nitrogen cycling. Studies have found there is a shift of bacterial community with reclamation time. However, effects of reclamation time on the soil archaeal community are still largely unknown. Here, we determined soil properties and archaeal community in the soil profiles (0-15, 15-30, 30-45 cm) of different reclaimed sites with different reclamation ages (R12: 12-year; R38: 38-year; R68: 68-year; R100: 100-year) in Rudong County, Jiangsu, China. Soil archaeal communities were identified via Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Soil archaeal communities were dominated by two phyla, the Crenarchaeota (82.1-93.3%) and Thermoplasmatota (4.2-17.9%), which are associated with nitrogen cycle (Nitrosopumilaceae, Nitrososphaeraceae, and Nitrosotaleaceae) and organic carbon metabolism (Marine_Group_II), respectively. Ammonia oxidizing archaea showed a divergent response to the reclamation, i.e. Nitrosotaleaceae increased with reclamation time whereas Nitrosopumilaceae showed a decreasing trend. Soil total carbon, total nitrogen, pH, EC, C:N ratio, NO3--N content, soil moisture, depth, and reclamation age determined archaeal community distribution in our reclaimed sites. Our findings suggest that both reclamation time and soil depth significantly shaped the archaeal community composition, and then in turn modulated soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in the reclaimed mudflats.

TI  - LEAF- AND CELL-LEVEL CARBON CYCLING RESPONSES TO A NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS GRADIENT IN TWO ARCTIC TUNDRA SPECIES
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
AB  - Premise of the study: Consequences of global climate change are detectable in the historically nitrogen-and phosphorus-limited Arctic tundra landscape and have implications for the terrestrial carbon cycle. Warmer temperatures and elevated soil nutrient availability associated with increased microbial activity may influence rates of photosynthesis and respiration.
   Methods: This study examined leaf-level gas exchange, cellular ultrastructure, and related leaf traits in two dominant tundra species, Betula nana, a woody shrub, and Eriophorum vaginatum, a tussock sedge, under a 3-yr-old treatment gradient of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization in the North Slope of Alaska.
   Key results: Respiration increased with N and P addition-the highest rates corresponding to the highest concentrations of leaf N in both species. The inhibition of respiration by light ("Kok effect") significantly reduced respiration rates in both species (P < 0.001), ranged from 12-63% (mean 34%), and generally decreased with fertilization for both species. However, in both species, observed rates of photosynthesis did not increase, and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency generally decreased under increasing fertilization. Chloroplast and mitochondrial size and density were highly sensitive to N and P fertilization (P < 0.001), though species interactions indicated divergent cellular organizational strategies.
   Conclusions: Results from this study demonstrate a species-specific decoupling of respiration and photosynthesis under N and P fertilization, implying an alteration of the carbon balance of the tundra ecosystem under future conditions.

TI  - Soil respiration, fine root production, and microbial biomass in cottonwood and loblolly pine plantations along a nitrogen fertilization gradient
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - It is well known that carbon storage capacity of forests will change in response to management practices such as fertilization. However, the influence of fertilization on belowground processes such as soil respiration, fine root production, and microbial biomass is still unclear. We measured soil respiration, fine root biomass production, and microbial biomass along a fertilization gradient (0, 56, 112, and 224 kg N ha(-1) per year) in 7-year-old cottonwood and loblolly pine plantations, established on a well-drained, Redbay sandy loam (a fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Rhodic Paleudlt), in northwest Florida. Soil respiration was measured monthly from June 2001 to May 2002 using the soda-lime technique. Fine root biomass production was quantified using the ingrowth core method during the same period. In addition, microbial biomass, soil temperature, moisture, soil pH, and organic matter were also measured along the same gradient for both species. Annual soil respiration rate was significantly greater (781 g C m(-2) per year) in cottonwood than that (692 g C m(-2) per year) in loblolly pine. Nitrogen fertilization had a significant negative effect on soil respiration in cottonwood, but no effect was observed in loblolly pine stands. Mean daily soil respiration rates exhibited significant exponential relationships with soil temperature both in cottonwood (R-2 = 0.81) and loblolly pine (R-2 = 0.51). Annual soil respiration rates in cottonwood stands were positively correlated with fine root production (r = 0.64) and soil microbial biomass C (r = 0.87) and negatively correlated with soil pH (r = -0.81). Annual soil respiration in loblolly pine stands was correlated positively with fine root production (r = 0.54) and with organic matter content (r = 0.74). Annual fine root production was significantly greater in cottonwood (221 g m(-2) per year) than that in loblolly pine (144 g m(-2) per year). Fertilization did not affect fine root production in both species. Microbial biomass, however, was significantly reduced by nitrogen fertilization in both species. We also observed an optimum range of soil pH (6.0 +/- 0.4), where highest microbial activity could be expected. Multiple regression analysis indicated that microbial biomass, soil organic matter, and soil pH were the major factors affecting soil respiration in cottonwood, while fine root production and soil organic matter were the major factors affecting soil respiration in loblolly pine. These results suggest that belowground responses to fertilization can vary widely between conifers and hardwoods. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Divergent regulation of nitrogen cycling genes under long-term organic and chemical fertilization in plateau cropland soils
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The fertilization of agricultural soils has a crucial impact on the microbial communities and nutrient cycling within the soil. However, it remains unclear how long-term fertilization regimes regulate microbial-driven carbon (C) /nitrogen (N) processes in agroecosystems, particularly in ecologically vulnerable plateaus. Here, we integrated metagenomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction techniques to explore fertilizationinduced changes in microbial communities and genes governing C/N cycling, and assessed their linkages to biogeochemical processes in a typical plateau cropland after six-year amendments. The results indicated that among microbial taxa carrying functional genes for C/N cycling, Nocardioides and Phycicoccus were the most significant responses to fertilization. Long-term organic fertilization significantly increased the abundance of genes associated with nitrogen fixation, assimilatory nitrate reduction, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction, enhancing the potential for soil N acquisition and retention, and increasing soil total N content by 47.2 % to 2.84 g kg- 1. And long-term application of chemical fertilizer and combinations of chemical and organic fertilizers both enhanced soil methane oxidation potential via increased the abundance of pmoA/B (by 2.0- to 2.7-fold), yet increased N2O production potential through different pathways: the former promoted incomplete denitrification genes (nirK, norB), while the latter increased nitrification genes (amoA, amoB, nxrB). Additionally, long-term chemical fertilization strengthened the dominance of nar- over nap-mediated nitrate reduction pathways, increasing the narG to napA gene abundance ratio by 85.5 %. In summary, this study revealed the effects of longterm applications of different fertilizer types on the community structures and functions of microorganisms involved in N and C cycling and provides a valuable reference for further understanding of nutrient cycling in agricultural soils.

TI  - Warming decreased plant litter decomposition by modulating soil fauna interactions in a Tibetan alpine meadow
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Litter decomposition is a vital process for maintaining ecosystem carbon cycling. It is affected by soil fauna which are predators and decomposers of litter. However, how the interactions of soil fauna communities affect litter decomposition remains unclear under warming. Here, we conducted a five-year in-situ manipulative warming experiment by Open-Top Chamber (OTC) in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau to reveal how warming affects litter decomposition. The results demonstrated that warming decreased the litter decomposition rate by 29 %, the soil collembola abundance by 25 %, and the nematode abundance by 27 %. Nematode ecological indices remain stable but a shift in the decomposition of litter to the fungivores pathway under warming. The piecewise structural equation modelling result revealed that the combined reduction in soil collembola and nematodes synergistically leads to a massive decline in litter decomposition rate under warming. Our results highlight that the interactions of soil fauna can regulate litter decomposition under warming, and collembola abundance as the "speed-limiter" of litter decomposition. Therefore, the response of changes in soil fauna relationships to warming should be completely considered in future climate change modelling of the grassland carbon cycle.

TI  - The potential of carbon dioxide capture and sequestration with algae
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - Algae are generally accepted as an excellent option for greenhouse gas control, but the ecological niche of algal CO2 bio-fixation is not completely understood today. This study showed an excellent CO2 uptake rate of 159 mgL(-1)day(-1) and CO2 consumption efficiency of 93% in comparison to the continuously stirred tank reactor (178 mgL(-1)day(-1) and 96%). Thus, the experimental ecosystem that imitated the freshwater algal niche had a similar CO2 uptake performance to the artificial ideal mixing reactor prototype. To investigate terrestrial plants as a carbon sink, we compared CO2 fixation rates among species, geographic areas, plant ages, and lignin contents; in the tropical zone, forest plantations had higher growth rates, higher lignin content, and higher CO2 uptake rates. In addition, natural forests and old plantations had the highest CO2 consumption efficiency. Furthermore, we found that algae had the highest CO2 uptake rates and CO2 consumption efficiency, a characteristic that is not found in other plants. Therefore, algae were able to accumulate large carbon stores within a short period of time and were able to play a critical role as a biological sink in the carbon cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Differential regulation of soil antibiotic resistance genes by biochar types and their derived dissolved organic matter
T2  - SOIL & ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Agricultural soil represent a critical hotspot for the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG), posing significant threats to food safety, public health, and agricultural sustainability. Biochar, a carbon-rich material derived from biomass pyrolysis, has emerged as a promising soil amendment capable of modulating the fate and transport of ARG in terrestrial ecosystems. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms by which biochar and its biochar-derived dissolved organic matter (BDOM) influence ARG dynamics remain poorly understood. It is hypothesized that biochar and BDOM regulate ARG dissemination through their effects on soil microbial community composition, functional potential, and metabolic activity. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a controlled microcosm experiment in which corn stover biochar (CBC), reed straw biochar (RBC), corn stover BDOM (CBDOM), and reed straw BDOM (RBDOM) were applied to agricultural soil amended with organic fertilizer. Our results revealed contrasting effects of the two biochars: CBC increased the relative abundance of ARGs by up to 2.48-fold compared to organic fertilizer control, whereas RBC consistently suppressed ARG levels by up to 91 %. In contrast, BDOM exhibited a comparatively weaker influence on ARG abundance than its solid-phase biochar counterpart. Partial least-squares path modeling identified mobile genetic elements as the primary drivers of ARG dissemination across all treatments. Notably, the CBC application was associated with a marked enrichment of IntI1, a clinical class 1 integron-integrase gene. Conversely, both RBC and BDOM suppressed polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolism and ATP synthesis, potentially reducing microbial antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, CBC promoted the potential ARG hosts involved in xenobiotic degradation, while RBC enhanced the potential hosts associated with the nitrogen cycle. Collectively, these findings elucidate the complex and feedstock-dependent roles of biochar in shaping ARG dynamics in agricultural soils, offering a strategic, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable approach to mitigate ARG pollution in agroecosystems.

TI  - Variable stoichiometry and homeostatic regulation of bacterial biomass elemental composition
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Prokaryotic heterotrophs (hereafter, bacteria) represent a large proportion of global biomass, and therefore bacterial biomass stoichiometry likely exerts control on global phosphorus (P), carbon (C), and nitrogen cycling and primary productivity. In this study we grew recently isolated freshwater heterotrophic bacteria across an ecologically relevant range of resource C:P ratios (organic C to P ratio in available resources) to quantify the P requirements of these organisms and examine the degree to which they regulated their P content under P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions. Bacterial biomass was only limited by P when resource C:P was greater than 250 (by atoms). Bacterial C:P ranged from 71 to 174 under P sufficiency and from 252 to 548 under P deficiency. Bacteria exhibited very little C:P homeostasis under P-sufficient growth conditions, greater C:P homeostasis under P-deficient conditions, and the ability of bacteria to outcompete one another in short-term experiments depended on a tradeoff between storing excess P for later use under P-deficient conditions or immediately using P to produce more biomass. These results indicate that freshwater heterotrophic bacteria are not as P-rich as previously thought and that homeostatic regulation of C:P stoichiometry depends on the individual taxa and what resource (organic C or available P) is limiting bacterial growth. Individual bacterial populations can vary between strong C:P homeostasis under P deficiency to virtually no C:P homeostasis under P sufficiency, but variation between taxa and the effect this has on competitive ability may dampen the signal in C:P-B at the bacterial community level. Nevertheless, the prevalence of homeostatic and non-homeostatic strategies in a bacterial community should have important implications for nutrient regeneration and carbon cycling.

TI  - Pasture in crop rotations influences microbial biodiversity and function reducing the potential for nitrogen loss from compost
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Agroecosystems make up a significant portion of terrestrial ecosystems and receive a disproportionally high amount of terrestrial nitrogen inputs from fertilizer, leading to nitrogen loss and associated environmental problems. Integrated crop livestock systems, such as pasture-integrated crop rotations, may be more environmentally sustainable however the long-term effects of this management practice on soil microorganisms and nitrogen transformations are not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, samples were collected from a long-term experiment designed to assess the impacts of, and interaction between, compost application and pasture-integrated crop rotations. The compost-input and pasture-integrated rotation treatments increased soil organic matter by 41 % and 14 % respectively, carbon mineralization by 127 % and 146 %, and extracellular enzyme activity by 74 % and 35 %, suggesting enhanced heterotrophic microbial activity. Compost addition led to rapid ammonification, increased potential nitrification rates similar to 3-fold, and enhanced nitrate concentration by similar to 75%. Further, compost addition more than doubled the abundance of prokaryotic ammonia oxidizing organisms (AOO). These effects of compost on nitrogen cycling were greatly mitigated by the pasture-integration likely due to enhanced microbial decomposition activity associated with carbon inputs from perennial grasses. Specifically, pasture-integration mitigated increases in potential nitrification, AOO abundance, and soil nitrate concentrations. The rates of potential nitrification were correlated with the abundance of AOO, highlighting the connection between nitrogen cycling processes and microbial community composition. These patterns in nitrifier abundances, potential nitrification rates, and nitrate levels indicate that the long-term integration of pasture in crop rotations has the potential to reduce early-season nitrogen loss without reducing crop productivity. This work demonstrates how management practices that facilitate favorable interactions between microbial carbon and nitrogen cycling may enhance agroecosystem sustainability and reduce nitrogen pollution.

TI  - The underestimated global importance of plant belowground coarse organs in open biomes for ecosystem functioning and conservation
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Open biomes such as grasslands, savannas, shrublands are associated with many global biodiversity hotspots, and cover -60% of land globally. Yet, extensive and increasing anthropogenic activities threaten their functioning and biodiversity. Here, we argue that, in open biomes, researchers and stakeholders (e.g., policy -makers, practitioners) should more comprehensively acknowledge that more than half of a plant's biomass is typically located belowground. Not only fine roots but different belowground coarse organs of plants (e.g., thick roots, rhizomes) play key ecosystem functions that have been largely neglected in basic and applied ecology. By more accurately accounting for the distribution of these organs along ecological gradients, their biomass turnover and decomposition rate, we would improve estimates of carbon cycling (core in climate change mitigation policies) as well as ameliorating conservation efforts focused on open biomes worldwide.

TI  - Implications of reduced root-soil contact for microbial rhizosphere establishment and early plant growth performance
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Processes at the root-soil interface are essential for plant nutrient and water uptake, but the level of root-soil contact varies depending on root traits and soil properties. Implications of reduced root-soil contact for the rhizosphere, its microbiota and for plant performance remain largely unclear. Here, the consequences of root-soil contact reduction were analyzed in maize microcosm experiments. Either soil porosity was modified by introducing artificial large-sized pores, or the contact area was reduced by a maize mutant (rth3) impaired in root hair development. Microscopic evaluation of roots grown in pores without soil contact revealed strongly reduced prokaryotic surface colonization. Bacterial abundance in the rhizosphere soil of remaining contact areas was also reduced (2.2 x 1010 vs. 1.0 x 109 16S rRNA gene copies per g dry soil), including the abundance of nitrogen cycling bacteria. The absence of root hairs decreased bacterial abundance likewise, though not of nitrogen cycling prokaryotes. 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing revealed bacterial community-compositional alterations in the rhizosphere (PERMANOVA R2 = 0.701, p = 0.001) with lower relative abundances of Massilia and Paenibacillus for roots grown in pores. Community shifts in the rhizosphere of rth3 plants showed similar changes. No differences were evident upon root-soil contact reduction in the endosphere bacterial community. Combined manipulations revealed that root hairs improved root-soil contact in pores, whereas lateral roots reduced it, as validated with a maize mutant (lrt1) impaired in lateral root development. Plant growth and biomass allocation in the first three weeks were only weakly affected by root-soil contact reduction. Overall, the level of root-soil contact appears critical for bacterial life in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane, including the establishment of nitrifying bacteria and potential plant-beneficial taxa such as Massilia. Aiming at optimum rootsoil contact by soil management and plant breeding strategies has thus the potential to contribute to the establishment of a functional rhizosphere microbiome.

TI  - Impact of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis on root system architecture and nutrient absorption in Chinese chestnut and pecan seedlings
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Background and aimsEctomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis can alter root tip structures; but the detailed mechanisms behind these changes and their impact on overall root architecture remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ECM inoculation with Cenococcum geophilum (Cg) and Pisolithus orientalis (Po) on root growth, nutrient levels in shoots, and enzyme activities in soil for Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) and pecan (Carya illinoinensis) seedlings.MethodsChestnut and pecan seedlings were inoculated with Cg or Po. The growth parameters, including root and shoot development, were assessed. Nutrient levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the shoots were measured, and soil enzyme activities related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles, such as beta-glucosidase, peroxidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase, were quantified.ResultsInoculation with ECM fungi significantly enhanced root growth, especially fine roots, and improved nutrient accumulation in the shoots of both seedlings. Cg and Po inoculation increased nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in the shoots. Moreover, the soil enzymes involved in the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles, such as beta-glucosidase, peroxidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, and acid phosphatase, showed elevated activity levels under ECM inoculation. Notably, Cg inoculation elevated peroxidase activity, which is linked to root development and soil hormone regulation.ConclusionECM symbiosis, especially with Cenococcum geophilum, positively influences root structure and nutrient absorption, enhancing seedling growth in chestnut and pecan. These findings highlight the role of ECM fungi in improving plant growth, particularly under conditions of limited colonization.

TI  - Carbon Sequestration in Turfgrass-Soil Systems
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Plants are key components of the terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle. Atmospheric CO2 is assimilated through photosynthesis and stored in plant biomass and in the soil. The use of turfgrass is expanding due to the increasing human population and urbanization. In this review, we summarize recent carbon sequestration research in turfgrass and compare turfgrass systems to other plant systems. The soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in turfgrass systems is comparable to that in other natural and agricultural systems. Turfgrass systems are generally carbon-neutral or carbon sinks, with the exception of intensively managed areas, such as golf course greens and athletic fields. Turfgrass used in other areas, such as golf course fairways and roughs, parks, and home lawns, has the potential to contribute to carbon sequestration if proper management practices are implemented. High management inputs can increase the biomass productivity of turfgrass but do not guarantee higher SOC compared to low management inputs. Additionally, choosing the appropriate turfgrass species that are well adapted to the local climate and tolerant to stresses can maximize CO2 assimilation and biomass productivity, although other factors, such as soil respiration, can considerably affect SOC. Future research is needed to document the complete carbon footprint, as well as to identify best management practices and appropriate turfgrass species to enhance carbon sequestration in turfgrass systems.

TI  - Flood and Edge Effects on Leaf Breakdown in Wetlands of the Cerrado Savanna to Amazonia Ecotone
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - We studied the rates of leaf decomposition and loss of leaf constituents (lignin and cellulose) of a native plant species using the litterbag experiment during different seasonal periods (flood and drought) in periodically flooded ecosystems, locally known as "Ipucas". The effects of flood, edge and fungal colonization on leaf degradation were evaluated. The results show that leaf decomposition is very slow, and influenced by seasonality, flooding and leaf chemical quality. Low moisture and leaf structural components contribute to the slow rate of decomposition. In addition, the fungal biomass was sensitive to the edge effect, with higher values in the center, probably due to the edge losing moisture earlier than the center after the end of rainy season. In addition, the positive correlation of fungal biomass with flooding demonstrates the importance of seasonality in these temporally flooded ecosystems, indicating that global changes in rainfall patterns may disrupt carbon cycling and probably nutrient cycling in periodically flooded environments.

TI  - Effects of Waterlogging on Soybean Rhizosphere Bacterial Community Using V4, LoopSeq, and PacBio 16S rRNA Sequence
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
AB  - Waterlogging causes a significant reduction in soil oxygen levels, which in turn negatively affects soil nutrient use efficiency and crop yields. Rhizosphere microbes can help plants to better use nutrients and thus better adapt to this stress, while it is not clear how the plant-associated microbes respond to waterlogging stress. There are also few reports on whether this response is influenced by different sequencing methods and by different soils. In this study, using partial 16S rRNA sequencing targeting the V4 region and two full-length 16S rRNA sequencing approaches targeting the V1 to V9 regions, the effects of waterlogging on soybean rhizosphere bacterial structure in two types of soil were examined. Our results showed that, compared with the partial 16S sequencing, full-length sequencing, both LoopSeq and Pacific Bioscience (PacBio) 16S sequencing, had a higher resolution. On both types of soil, all the sequencing methods showed that waterlogging significantly affected the bacterial community structure of the soybean rhizosphere and increased the relative abundance of Geobacter. Furthermore, modular analysis of the cooccurrence network showed that waterlogging increased the relative abundance of some microorganisms related to nitrogen cycling when using V4 sequencing and increased the microorganisms related to phosphorus cycling when using LoopSeq and PacBio 16S sequencing methods. Core microorganism analysis further revealed that the enriched members of different species might play a central role in maintaining the stability of bacterial community structure and ecological functions. Together, our study explored the role of microorganisms enriched at the rhizosphere under waterlogging in assisting soybeans to resist stress. Furthermore, compared to partial and PacBio 16S sequencing, LoopSeq offers improved accuracy and reduced sequencing prices, respectively, and enables accurate species-level and strain identification from complex environmental microbiome samples.
   IMPORTANCE Soybeans are important oil-bearing crops, and waterlogging has caused substantial decreases in soybean production all over the world. The microbes associated with the host have shown the ability to promote plant growth, nutrient absorption, and abiotic resistance. High-throughput sequencing of partial 16S rRNA is the most commonly used method to analyze the microbial community. However, partial sequencing cannot provide correct classification information below the genus level, which greatly limits our research on microbial ecology. In this study, the effects of waterlogging on soybean rhizosphere microbial structure in two soil types were explored using partial 16S rRNA and full-length 16S gene sequencing by LoopSeq and Pacific Bioscience (PacBio). The results showed that fulllength sequencing had higher classification resolution than partial sequencing. Three sequencing methods all indicated that rhizosphere bacterial community structure was significantly impacted by waterlogging, and the relative abundance of Geobacter was increased in the rhizosphere in both soil types after suffering waterlogging. Moreover, the core microorganisms obtained by different sequencing methods all contain species related to nitrogen cycling. Together, our study not only explored the role of microorganisms enriched at the rhizosphere level under waterlogging in assisting soybean to resist stress but also showed that LoopSeq sequencing is a less expensive and more convenient method for full-length sequencing by comparing different sequencing methods.

AB  - The discovery of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), now generally recognized to exert primary control over ammonia oxidation in terrestrial, marine, and geothermal habitats, necessitates a reassessment of the nitrogen cycle. In particular, the unusually high affinity of marine and terrestrial AOA for ammonia indicates that this group may determine the oxidation state of nitrogen available to associated micro- and macrobiota, altering our current understanding of trophic interactions. Initial comparative genomics and physiological studies have revealed a novel, and as yet unresolved, primarily copper-based pathway for ammonia oxidation and respiration distinct from that of known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and possibly relevant to the production of atmospherically active nitrogen oxides. Comparative studies also provide compelling evidence that the lineage of Archaea with which the AOA affiliate is sufficiently divergent to justify the creation of a novel phylum, the Thaumarchaeota.

TI  - Estimates of Carbon Reservoirs in High-Altitude Wetlands in the Colombian Andes
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS
AB  - The observed increase in emission of greenhouse gases, with attendant effects on global warming, have raised interests in identifying sources and sinks of carbon in the environment. Terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Particularly, wetland systems function primarily as long-term reservoirs for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and as sources of atmospheric methane (CH4). The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of carbon reservoirs in two high-altitude wetlands in the central Andean mountain of Colombia. Carbon cycle in both systems is related mainly with the plant biomass dynamics from the littoral zone. Thus, total organic carbon concentrate an average up to 329 kg of N ha(-1) and 125 kg of P ha(-1) every year vs only 17 kg N ha(-1) and 6 kg P ha(-1) in the water column of the limnetic zone in the wetland, evidencing spatial differences in carbon concentrations for these types of ecosystems. Results revealed that these systems participate in the balance and sequestration of carbon in the Colombian Andes.

TI  - Assessment of functional diversity and structure of phytate-hydrolysing bacterial community in Lolium perenne rhizosphere
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Plant growth is frequently limited by the availability of inorganic phosphorus (P) in the soil. In most soils, a considerable amount of the soil P is bound to organic molecules. Of these, phytate is the most abundant identifiable organic P form, but is not readily available to plants. In contrast, microorganisms have been shown to degrade phytate with high efficiency. The current study aims to characterize the members of the phytate-hydrolysing bacterial community in rhizosphere, and the molecular and enzymatic ability of these bacteria to degrade phytate.
   The phytate-hydrolysing bacterial community was characterized from the rhizosphere of plants cultivated in the presence or absence of phytate supplementation. Major changes in the bacterial community structure were observed with both culture-dependent and -independent methods, which highlighted the predominance of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Phytase activity was detected for a range of rhizobacterial isolates as well as the presence of, beta-propeller phytases (BPP) for both isolates and directly in a soil sample.
   A wide taxonomic range of functional phytate utilizers have been discovered, in soil bacterial taxa that were previously not well known for their ability to utilise phytate as P or C sources. This study provides new insights into microbial carbon and phosphorus cycling in soil.

TI  - The interplay of labile organic carbon, enzyme activities and microbial communities of two forest soils across seasons
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Soil labile organic carbon (LOC) responds rapidly to environmental changes and plays an important role in carbon cycle. In this study, the seasonal fluctuations in LOC, the activities of carbon-cycle related enzymes, and the bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed for soils collected from two forests, namely Betula albosinensis (Ba) and Picea asperata Mast. (Pa), in the Qinling Mountains of China. Results revealed that the seasonal average contents of microbial biomass carbon (MBC), easily oxidized organic carbon (EOC), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) of Pa forest soil were 13.5%, 30.0% and 15.7% less than those in Ba soil. The seasonal average enzyme activities of beta -1,4-glucosidase (beta G), and beta -1,4-xylosidase (beta X) of Ba forest soils were 30.0% and 32.3% higher than those of Pa soil while the enzyme activity of cellobiohydrolase (CBH) was 19.7% lower. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Acidobacteria was significantly higher in summer than in winter, whereas the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was higher in winter. Regarding the fungal communities, the relative abundance of Basidiomycota was lowest in winter, whereas Ascomycota predominated in the same season. In addition, the soil LOC was significantly positively correlated with the CBH, beta G and beta X activities. Changes in LOC were significantly correlated with Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Basidiomycota. We conclude that the seasonal fluctuations in forest soil LOC fractions relied on carbon cycle-associated enzymatic activities and microorganisms, which in turn were affected by climatic conditions.

TI  - Ecological effect of microplastics on soil microbe-driven carbon circulation and greenhouse gas emission: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) pool, the largest part of terrestrial ecosystem, controls global terrestrial carbon balance and consequently presented carbon cycle-climate feedback in climate projections. Microplastics, (MPs, <5 mm) as common pollutants in soil ecosystems, have an obvious impact on soil-borne carbon circulation by affecting soil microbial processes, which play a central role in regulating SOC conversion. In this review, we initially presented the sources, properties and ecological risks of MPs in soil ecosystem, and then the differentiated effects of MPs on the component of SOC, including dissolved organic carbon, soil microbial biomass carbon and easily oxidized organic carbon varying with the types and concentrations of MPs, the soil types, etc. As research turns into a broader perspective, greenhouse gas emissions dominated by the mineralization of SOC coming into view since it can be significantly affected by MPs and is closely associated with soil microbial respiration. The pathways of MPs impacting soil microbes-driven carbon conversion include changing microbial community structure and composition, the functional enzyme's activity and the abundance and expression of functional genes. However, numerous uncertainties still exist regarding the microbial mechanisms in the deeper biochemical process. More comprehensive studies are necessary to explore the affected footprint and provide guidance for finding the evaluation criterion of MPs affecting climate change.

TI  - Effects of 5 years of corn residue grazing and baling on nitrogen cycling, soil compaction, and wind erosion potential
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION
AB  - Corn residue grazing can provide a valuable and cost effective means of feeding cattle and is a common practice in most corn producing states. Mechanical means of residue removal (baling) is also often practiced as a means of harvesting cattle feed. However, there are concerns about the effects of management practices that remove crop residue on soil processes such as compaction, aggregation, and N cycling. To study these concerns, an experiment with four treatments including control, light grazing, heavy grazing, and baling was carried out for 5 years at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Water Resources Field Laboratory near Brule, NE. Soil penetration resistance was measured after 3, 4, and 5 years of residue removal. Wind erodible fraction, mean weight diameter of dry aggregates, and soil total N were measured after 5 years. Corn yields were determined throughout the study. Results indicate that light grazing showed little or no difference from the no residue removal treatment, but heavy grazing and baled treatments often had higher penetration resistance, indicating that high rates of residue removal may increase risks of soil compaction. However, compaction did not appear to be cumulative over time. No significant differences were observed in wind erodible fraction and dry aggregate mean weight diameter. However, there were trends that suggest heavy grazing and baling may, in the long term, reduce dry aggregate stability, increasing wind erosion potential. Results also show that in the surface 0-2.5 cm grazing animals may increase soil total N and that baling residue may decrease soil N content. There was no impact on corn yields throughout the study. Overall, corn residue grazing and baling appear to have little or no adverse effects on soil compaction, aggregation, or nitrogen cycling after 5 years.

TI  - Identify the key factors driving the lignocellulose degradation of litter along a forest succession chronosequence from the perspective of functional genes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to discover the key factors driving the lignocellulose degradation in litter along a forest succession chronosequence from the perspective of functional genes. We investigated four natural successive stages of forests (white birch forest, broad-leaved mixed forest, coniferous-broad-leaved mixed forest, and mixed broadleaved-Korean pine forest). We determined the lignocellulose degradation of litter and the absolute abundance of related functional genes by using high-throughput-qPCR. There was strong degradation of cellulose content, hemicellulose and lignin contents in the litter decomposition layer in the early and late stages of forest succession, respectively. Furthermore, forest succession changed microbial communities' succession and increased fungal Shannon diversity, and then enhanced the absolute abundance of lignocellulose-degrading genes and nitrogen-cycling genes. By network analysis, bacterial and fungal module 1 were key modules for producing lignocellulose-degrading genes and nitrogen cycling genes, while fungal module 2 was a key module for lignin-degrading genes. Fungi were strongly correlated with functional genes based on Procrustes analysis. Additionally, cellulose-degrading genes were the key factor driving the cellulose degradation in the early period of forest succession, while fungal diversity and composition were key drivers in promoting the degradation of lignin in the late period of forest succession. Our study provided insight into the mechanisms underlying the soil microbe-driven functional changes in nutrient cycling and an understanding of the decomposition kinetics of litter at a more microscopic level in the process of forest succession.

TI  - Application of targeted metagenomics to explore abundance and diversity of CO2-fixing bacterial community using cbbL gene from the rhizosphere of Arachis hypogaea
T2  - GENE
AB  - Sequestration of CO2 by autotrophic bacteria is a key process of biogeochemical carbon cycling in soil ecosystem. Rhizosphere is a rich niche of microbial activity and diversity, influenced by change in atmospheric CO2. Structural changes in rhizosphere composition influence microbial communities and the nutrient cycling. In the present study, the bacterial diversity and population dynamics were established using cbbL and 16S rRNA gene targeted metagenomics approach from the rhizosphere of Arachis hypogaea. A total of 108 cbbL clones were obtained from the rhizospheric soil which revealed predominance of cbbL sequences affiliated to Rhizobium leguminosarum, Bradyrhizobium sp., Sinorhizobium meliloti, Ochrobactrum anthropi and a variety of uncultured cbbL,harboring bacteria. The 16S rRNA,gene clone library exhibited the dominance of Firmicutes (34.4%), Proteobacteria (18.3%), Actinobacteria (17.2%) and Bacteroidetes (16.1%). About 43% nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA gene clone library were novel genera which showed <95% homology with published sequences. Gene copy number of cbbL and 16S rRNA genes, determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT PCR), was 938 +/- 0.75 x 10(7) and 5.43 +/- 0.79 x 10(8) (per g dry soil), respectively. The results exhibited bacterial community structure with high bacterial diversity and abundance of CO2-fixing bacteria, which can be explored further for their role in carbon cycling, sustainable agriculture and environment management.

TI  - Microbial Mediation of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Sulfur Cycles During Solid Waste Decomposition
T2  - MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Landfills are a unique "terrestrial ecosystem" and serve as a significant carbon sink. Microorganisms convert biodegradable substances in municipal solid waste (MSW) to CH4, CO2, and microbial biomass, consisting of the carbon cycling in landfills. Microbial-mediated N and S cycles are also the important biogeochemical process during MSW decomposition, resulting in N2O and H2S emission, respectively. Meanwhile, microbial-mediated N and S cycles affect carbon cycling. How microbial community structure and function respond to C, N, and S cycling during solid waste decomposition, however, are not well-characterized. Here, we show the response of bacterial and archaeal community structure and functions to C, N, and S cycling during solid waste decomposition in a long-term (265 days) operation laboratory-scale bioreactor through 16S rRNA-based pyrosequencing and metagenomics analysis. Bacterial and archaeal community composition varied during solid waste decomposition. Aerobic respiration was the main pathway for CO2 emission, while anaerobic C fixation was the main pathway in carbon fixation. Methanogenesis and denitrification increased during solid waste decomposition, suggesting increasing CH4 and N2O emission. In contract, fermentation decreased along solid waste decomposition. Interestingly, Clostridiales were abundant and showed potential for several pathways in C, N, and S cycling. Archaea were involved in many pathways of C and N cycles. There is a shift between bacteria and archaea involvement in N-2 fixation along solid waste decomposition that bacteria Clostridiales and Bacteroidales were initially dominant and then Methanosarcinales increased and became dominant in methanogenic phase. These results provide extensive microbial mediation of C, N, and S cycling profiles during solid waste decomposition.

TI  - Oats hay supplementation to yak grazing alpine meadow improves carbon return to the soil of grassland ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Supplementation of livestock feed is a common strategy for improving animal production in pasture-based systems worldwide. On the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China, however, the grassland ecosystem is fragile and therefore sensitive to disruption by external forces. We therefore investigated the effects of supplementing yaks feed with oats hay on animal production, forage biomass, and carbon return in litter and dung as well as the effects on soil organic carbon stock. Two grazing systems-native grazing, or grazing with hay supplementation-were established in 2010. For the native grazing system, yaks were rotationally grazed in two paddocks (3.3 yaks/ha) with each 15 days during the warm season (July through October) and 20 days during the cold season (November through June). The hay supplementation system was the same as the native system except that each yak also received oats hay (1.5 kg/day, dry matter basis) during the cold season. For each system, yak growth, forage biomass of the pasture, carbon return from litter and dung to soil, and soil organic carbon stock were measured from 2010 to 2014. The yaks supplemented with oats hay had greater growth performance compared with non supplemented animals, thereby providing economic benefits for herdsmen. With respect to carbon cycling, supplementation increased carbon return in litter and dung and consequently reduced the soil carbon stock loss. The results indicate that supplementation with oats hay positively impacted forage production and carbon cycling in alpine meadows and thus may help remediate degraded soils and improve grassland utilization on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

TI  - Soil C/N and pH together as a comprehensive indicator for evaluating the effects of organic substitution management in subtropical paddy fields after application of high-quality amendments
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Organic substitution management (OSM) is a key technology employed to reduce the amount of chemical fertilizer used in agricultural operations with the goal of reducing environmental pollution and ensuring green and sustainable agricultural development in China. However, there is still limited information regarding the underlying interactions between soil nutrients, enzyme activities and microbial community structures after long-term partial substitution of inorganic N with organic amendments, and no suitable evaluation indicators of organic substitution effects have been identified. Here, distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA), principal component analysis (PCA), the partial least squares method (PLS) and the partial least squares path model (PLSPM) were used to better understand the impact of substitution effects on soil biochemical indexes in a 34-year field experiment. We found that soil C/N significantly directly affected rice yield, and that a soil C/N ranging from 10.12 to 10.19 could sustain a rice yield between 7000 and 6800 kg ha(-1). Moreover, the soil hydrolase activities of the carbon and fungi communities were significantly influenced by both C/N and pH, and the carbon-cycling enzyme activities were found to be more susceptible to C/N than nitrogen-cycling enzyme activities. The low soil C/N and high pH after OSM decreased the ratio of G(+) to G(-) and fungi to bacteria, indicating OSM increased the nutrient availability and benefited growth of the bacterial community. Hence, we believe that soil C/N and pH together can be used as a comprehensive index for suitable evaluation of the effects of OSM.

TI  - Effects of Legume-Cereal Rotation on Sorghum Rhizosphere Microbial Community Structure and Nitrogen-Cycling Functions
T2  - MICROBIOLOGYOPEN
AB  - Legumes form mutualistic interactions with specific soil microbiomes that fix atmospheric nitrogen and improve soil fertility. However, legume-based rotations influence on soil microorganisms and their correlations with soil physicochemical parameters during subsequent crop development are not yet clear. We examined the shifts in microbial community structure and nitrogen genes via shotgun sequencing across cowpea-sorghum, soybean-sorghum, maize-sorghum rotations, and sorghum without precrops. Precropping in rotation significantly affected N-NO3, clay, and silt, and caused a shift in the rhizosphere microbiome. Actinomycetota was the most predominant bacteria across all the cropping systems, followed by Pseudomonadota, whose composition differed across the cropping systems. Legume in rotation increased the relative abundance of Streptomyces and reduced the relative abundances of Pyxidicoccus, Microbacterium, and Microvirga. Nocardioides and Solirubrobacter predominated in the soil after the maize crops. Shannon index, non-metric multidimensional scaling, and permutational multivariate analysis of variance revealed that crop rotation caused significant differences in both the alpha and beta diversity of the microbial community and the nitrogen-cycling functional genes. The relative abundances of amoC, narH, gltB, glnA, ureC, napA, and napA significantly increased in legume monocrops in rotation. The relative abundances of glnA, gltB, narZ, and narH increased in the soil after maize cropping, whereas sorghum without precrops significantly increased the relative abundances of glnA, narZ, and ureC. Several soil physicochemical parameters drive microbial communities. *S, Na, N-NH4, N-NH3, and P were the most significant environmental variables regulating microbiome and nitrogen-cycling genes by crop rotation. This study supports sustainable agricultural practices and promotes sorghum development through rhizosphere microbiome optimization.

TI  - Arbuscular mycorrhiza and soil nitrogen cycling
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Nitrogen is a major nutrient that frequently limits primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, the physiological responses of plants to soil nitrogen (N) availability have been extensively investigated, and the study of the soil N-cycle has become an important component of ecosystem ecology and biogeochemistry. The bulk of the literature in these areas has, however, overlooked the fact that most plants form mycorrhizal associations, and that nutrient uptake is therefore mediated by mycorrhizal fungi. It is well established that ecto- and ericoid mycorrhizas influence N nutrition of plants, but roles of arbuscular mycorrhizas in N nutrition are less well established; perhaps even more importantly, current conceptual models ignore possible influences of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi on N-cycling processes. We review evidence for the interaction between the AM symbiosis with microbes and processes involved in soil N-cycling. We show that to date investigations have rather poorly addressed such interactions and discuss possible reasons for this. We outline mechanisms that could potentially operate with regards to AM fungal N-cycling interactions, discuss experimental designs aimed at studying these, and conclude by pointing out priorities for future research.

TI  - Weak interactions between strong interactors in an old-field ecosystem: Control of nitrogen cycling by coupled herbivores and detritivores
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Interactions between herbivores and detritivores are common in greenhouse and laboratory experiments. Such interactions are thought to cause feedbacks in real ecosystems where the combined actions of these animals create either high or low nutrient cycling rates. There is limited evidence from factorial field experiments to support these expectations.
   2. We present the results of a 3-year experiment wherein we factorially manipulated grasshopper herbivores and earthworm detritivores in an old-field ecosystem and tested for significant interaction effects on plants, nitrogen mineralization and micro-organisms. Then, we used a dynamical system model built and parameterized for the study ecosystem to test the theoretical strength of these interactions. We predicted that grasshoppers and earthworms would have a positive interaction effect on plant growth and nitrogen cycling by driving plant community change.
   3. We found neither evidence for interaction effects on any of the variables we measured nor a consistent change in the composition of the plant community even though the individual effects of grasshoppers and earthworms were as expected. Our dynamical system model made the same prediction across a broad section of parameter space (e.g. feeding rates, death rates, etc) and after longer term simulations.
   4. Our results suggest that interactions between herbivores and detritivores are only likely in situ when animals have exceptionally high individual effects on ecosystems and where the exogenous forces driving plant community change and soil biogeochemical fluxes are weak.

TI  - Soil Bacterial and Fungal Richness Forecast Patterns of Early Pine Litter Decomposition
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Discovering widespread microbial processes that drive unexpected variation in carbon cycling may improve modeling and management of soil carbon (Prescott, 2010; Wieder et al., 2015a, 2018). A first step is to identify community features linked to carbon cycle variation. We addressed this challenge using an epidemiological approach with 206 soil communities decomposing Ponderosa pine litter in 618 microcosms. Carbon flow from litter decomposition was measured over a 6-week incubation. Cumulative CO2 from microbial respiration varied two-fold among microcosms and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from litter decomposition varied five-fold, demonstrating large functional variation despite constant environmental conditions where strong selection is expected. To investigate microbial features driving DOC concentration, two microbial community cohorts were delineated as "high" and "low" DOC. For each cohort, communities from the original soils and from the final microcosm communities after the 6-week incubation with litter were taxonomically profiled. A logistic model including total biomass, fungal richness, and bacterial richness measured in the original soils or in the final microcosm communities predicted the DOC cohort with 72 (P < 0.05) and 80 (P < 0.001) percent accuracy, respectively. The strongest predictors of the DOC cohort were biomass and either fungal richness (in the original soils) or bacterial richness (in the final microcosm communities). Successful forecasting of functional patterns after lengthy community succession in a new environment reveals strong historical contingencies. Forecasting future community function is a key advance beyond correlation of functional variance with end-state community features. The importance of taxon richness-the same feature linked to carbon fate in gut microbiome studies-underscores the need for increased understanding of biotic mechanisms that can shape richness in microbial communities independent of physicochemical conditions.

TI  - Denitrification in Gram-positive bacteria: an underexplored trait
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS
AB  - Denitrifying organisms are essential in removing fixed nitrogen pollutants from ecosystems (e.g. sewage sludge). They can be detrimental (e.g. for agricultural soil) and can also produce the greenhouse gas N2O (nitrous oxide). Therefore a more comprehensive understanding of this process has become increasingly important regarding its global environmental impact. Even though bacterial genome sequencing projects may reveal new data, to date the denitrification abilities and features in Gram-positive bacteria are still poorly studied and understood. The present review evaluates current knowledge on the denitrification trait in Gram-positive bacteria and addresses the likely existence of unknown denitrification genes. In addition, current molecular tools to study denitrification gene diversity in pure cultures and environmental samples seem to be highly biased, and additional novel approaches for the detection of denitrifying (Gram-positive) bacteria appear to be crucial in re-assessing the real diversity of denitrifiers.

TI  - Polyethylene microplastic and biochar interactively affect the global warming potential of soil greenhouse gas emissions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Emerging microplastic pollution and biochar application result in their coexistence in the soil. In this study, a polyethylene microplastic, a straw biochar, and a manure biochar were applied alone or in combination to an agricultural soil to explore their interactive effects on microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, bacterial com-munity composition, structure and function, and the resultant greenhouse gas emissions in a 45-day laboratory incubation. At the end of incubation, the co-application of microplastic and biochar suppressed the global warming potential of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions compared with the sum of their application alone. Specifically, coexisting with microplastics increased N2O emissions by 37.5% but decreased CH4 emissions by 35.8% in the straw biochar added soil, and decreased N2O, CO2 and CH4 emissions by 24.8, 6.2, and 65.2%, respectively, in the manure biochar added soil. A correlation network analysis illustrated that the increased global warming potential was related to the changed bacterial function and microbial biomass carbon and ni-trogen in the treatments with straw biochar and/or polyethylene microplastic added, and by the changed bacterial community structure and function in the treatments with manure biochar and/or polyethylene microplastic added. Bacterial functions associated with tricarboxylic acid cycle contributed to CO2 emissions. Bacterial functions associated with the nitrogen cycle such as nosZ and AOBamoABC were negatively and positively correlated with N2O emissions, respectively. The interaction between different types of microplastics and soil amendments and the resultant effects on ecosystem function deserve further research.

TI  - Assessing the responses of Sphagnum micro-eukaryotes to climate changes using high throughput sequencing
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Current projections suggest that climate warming will be accompanied by more frequent and severe drought events. Peatlands store ca. one third of the world's soil organic carbon. Warming and drought may cause peatlands to become carbon sources through stimulation of microbial activity increasing ecosystem respiration, with positive feedback effect on global warming. Micro-eukaryotes play a key role in the carbon cycle through food web interactions and therefore, alterations in their community structure and diversity may affect ecosystem functioning and could reflect these changes. We assessed the diversity and community composition of Sphagnum-associated eukaryotic microorganisms inhabiting peatlands and their response to experimental drought and warming using high throughput sequencing of environmental DNA. Under drier conditions, micro-eukaryotic diversity decreased, the relative abundance of autotrophs increased and that of osmotrophs (including Fungi and Peronosporomycetes) decreased. Furthermore, we identified climate change indicators that could be used as early indicators of change in peatland microbial communities and ecosystem functioning. The changes we observed indicate a shift towards a more "terrestrial'' community in response to drought, in line with observed changes in the functioning of the ecosystem.

TI  - High Salinity Inhibits Soil Bacterial Community Mediating Nitrogen Cycling
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Salinization is considered a major threat to soil fertility and agricultural productivity throughout the world. Soil microbes play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem stability and function (e.g., nitrogen cycling). However, the response of bacterial community composition and community-level function to soil salinity remains uncertain. Here, we used multiple statistical analyses to assess the effect of high salinity on bacterial community composition and potential metabolism function in the agricultural ecosystem. Results showed that high salinity significantly altered both bacterial alpha (Shannon-Wiener index and phylogenetic diversity) and beta diversity. Salinity, total nitrogen (TN), and soil organic matter (SOM) were the vital environmental factors shaping bacterial community composition. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes decreased with salinity, whereas Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes increased with salinity. The modularity and the ratio of negative to positive links remarkedly decreased, indicating that high salinity destabilized bacterial networks. Variable selection, which belongs to deterministic processes, mediated bacterial community assembly within the saline soils. Function prediction results showed that the key nitrogen metabolism (e.g., ammonification, nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification processes) was inhibited in high salinity habitats. MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that the abundance and composition of the nitrifying community were influenced by high salinity. The consistency of function prediction and experimental verification demonstrated that high salinity inhibited soil bacterial community mediating nitrogen cycling. Our study provides strong evidence for a salinity effect on the bacterial community composition and key metabolism function, which could help us understand how soil microbes respond to ongoing environment perturbation.
   IMPORTANCE Revealing the response of the soil bacterial community to external environmental disturbances is an important but poorly understood topic in microbial ecology. In this study, we evaluated the effect of high salinity on the bacterial community composition and key biogeochemical processes in salinized agricultural soils (0.22 to 19.98 dS m(-1)). Our results showed that high salinity significantly decreased bacterial diversity, altered bacterial community composition, and destabilized the bacterial network. Moreover, variable selection (61% to 66%) mediated bacterial community assembly within the saline soils. Functional prediction combined with microbiological verification proved that high salinity inhibited soil bacterial community mediating nitrogen turnover. Understanding the impact of salinity on soil bacterial community is of great significance for managing saline soils and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.

TI  - Stable Isotope Probing the Nitrogen Cycle: Current Applications and Future Directions
T2  - METAGENOMICS OF THE MICROBIAL NITROGEN CYCLE: THEORY, METHODS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Much of our understanding of microbial ecophysiology with respect to nitrogen cycling has been derived from cultivation based techniques, which are unable to capture a large proportion of microbial diversity in the environment. 15N DNA stable isotope probing (SIP) is a technology that allows experimental assessment of nitrogen uptake in systems where requisite organisms cannot be cultivated by combining evidence for isotopic uptake with phylogenetic inferences via sequence based analysis. The technique has recently been applied in a variety of systems including enrichment cultures, soils, and marine environments. This chapter summarizes some historical perspective on 15N SIP methodology and reviews the available 15N SIP literature. Advantages and disadvantages of 15N SIP are discussed. Much of the potential of 15N SIP remains unrealized due to important experimental limitation. Recent technological developments that are likely to result in significant improvements in resolution and utility of stable isotope tracer techniques are also described.

TI  - Ubiquity and Diversity of Cold Adapted Denitrifying Bacteria Isolated From Diverse Antarctic Ecosystems
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Nitrogen cycle has been poorly investigated in Antarctic ecosystems. In particular, how extreme conditions of low temperature, dryness, and high radiation select the microorganisms involved in the cycle is not yet understood. Denitrification is an important step in the nitrogen cycle in which nitrate is reduced stepwise to the gases NO, N2O, and N-2. Denitrification is carried out by a wide group of microorganisms spread in the phylogenetic tree. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterize denitrifying bacteria present in different cold environments from Antarctica. Bacterial isolates were obtained from lake, meltwater, sea, glacier ice, ornithogenic soil, and penguin feces samples from King George Island, Fildes peninsula in the Antarctic. Samples were taken during the deicing season in five sampling campaigns. From all the samples we were able to isolate denitrifying strains. A total of 199 bacterial isolates with the capacity to grow in anaerobic mineral media reducing nitrate at 4 degrees C were obtained. The characterization of the isolates by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed a high predominance of the genus Pseudomonas, followed by Janthinobacterium, Flavobacterium, Psychrobacter, and Yersinia. Other minor genera detected were Cryobacterium, Iodobacter, Kaistella, and Carnobacterium. The capacity to denitrify was not previously described for most of the bacteria related to our isolates and in many of them denitrifying genes were not present suggesting the presence of new genes in this extreme environment. Our work demonstrates the ubiquity of denitrification in the Maritime Antarctica and gives important information linking denitrification at cold temperature with taxa in an unequivocal way.

TI  - Denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation and mechanisms influencing it in Yellow River Delta coastal wetland soil, China
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
AB  - Methane oxidation coupled to denitrification is mediated by Candidatus "Methylomirabilis oxyfera" (M. oxyfera), which belongs to the candidate phylum NC10, and plays a crucial role in the global carbon and nitrogen cycle. Using the Yellow River Delta coastal wetland as the study area, molecular biology technology and laboratory incubation were used to determine the abundance of NC10 bacteria and the denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) rate in soils from different vegetation areas. The results of the electrophoresis detection show that M. oxyfera-like bacteria can be found in the four types of soils, according to the growth analysis by the system, OTU1 (SA) has been found the highest similarity to first-discovered Candidatus Methylomir-abilis oxyfera (FP565575) (over 98%); Vegetation cover significantly increased the abundance of M. oxyfera-like bacteria compared to beach areas, which abundance was significantly higher in deeper layers than in surface ones. Nitrate, nitrite, total nitrogen, and conductivity were identified as the main environmental factors affecting the DAMO rate. This study showed that both groups A and B of Candidatus M. oxyfera-like bacteria exist in the coastal wetland of the Yellow River Delta, which provides molecular biological evidence for the existence of the DAMO process therein. Moreover, it was revealed the influence mechanism of physical and chemical characteristics of each region on the DAMO rate. This is of significance for furthering our understanding of the coupled effect of the global carbon and nitrogen cycle.

TI  - Microorganisms as bio-filters to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from high-altitude permafrost revealed by nanopore-based metagenomics
T2  - IMETA
AB  - The distinct climatic and geographical conditions make high-altitude permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau suffer more severe degradation than polar permafrost. However, the microbial responses associated with greenhouse gas production in thawing permafrost remain obscured. Here we applied nanopore-based long-read metagenomics and high-throughput RNA-seq to explore microbial functional activities within the freeze-thaw cycle in the active layers of permafrost at the Qilian Mountain. A bioinformatic framework was established to facilitate phylogenetic and functional annotation of the unassembled nanopore metagenome. By deploying this strategy, 42% more genera could be detected and 58% more genes were annotated to nitrogen and methane cycle. With the aid of such enlarged resolution, we observed vigorous aerobic methane oxidation by Methylomonas, which could serve as a bio-filter to mitigate CH4 emissions from permafrost. Such filtering effect could be further consolidated by both on-site gas phase measurement and incubation experiment that CO2 was the major form of carbon released from permafrost. Despite the increased transcriptional activities of aceticlastic methanogenesis pathways in the thawed permafrost active layer, CH4 generated during the thawing process could be effectively consumed by the microbiome. Additionally, the nitrogen metabolism in permafrost tends to be a closed cycle and active N2O consumption by the topsoil community was detected in the near-surface gas phase. Our findings reveal that although the increased thawed state facilitated the heterotrophic nitrogen and methane metabolism, effective microbial methane oxidation in the active layer could serve as a bio-filter to relieve the overall warming potentials of greenhouse gas emitted from thawed permafrost.
   On-site MinION metagenomics and RNA-seq were combined to explore microbial functionalities of active layers of the soil of Qilian Mountain permafrost. With the developed annotation pipeline-FUNpore, 42% more genera and 58% more genes were detected. Active methane consumption by Methylomonas could serve as a biofilter to mitigate CH4 emission from permafrost. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia pathway enabled a closed microbial nitrogen cycle and N2O consumption was observed. image

TI  - Effects of UV radiation and rainfall reduction on leaf and soil parameters related to C and N cycles of a Mediterranean shrubland before and after a controlled fire
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - In the Mediterranean basin, reduction in cloudiness owing to climate change is expected to enhance solar ultraviolet (UV) levels and to decrease rainfall over the coming years, which would be accompanied by more frequent and intense wildfires. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of solar UV-A and UV-B radiation in C and N pools of a Mediterranean shrubland and whether drier conditions could alter this role before and after a fire.
   Over a three-year field experiment, 18 plots of 9 m(2) were subjected to three UV conditions (UV-A + UV-B exclusion, UV-B exclusion or near-ambient UV-A + UV-B exposure) combined with two rainfall regimes (natural or reduced rainfall). Several parameters related to C and N cycles in the soil and in the leaves and litter of two dominant plant species (Arbutus unedo and Phillyrea angustifolia) were measured before and after an experimental fire.
   UV-A exposure increased soil moisture throughout the study period, as well as respiration before the fire. The additional presence of UV-B decreased beta-glucosidase activity at 5-10 cm depth and soil respiration and pH. UV-B exposure also raised leaf C concentration in P. angustifolia and delta N-15 values in A. unedo. Reduced rainfall often emphasized the opposite effects of UV-A and UV-B on the studied parameters. After the fire, most of the UV and rainfall effects were lost.
   UV-A exposure seems to stimulate soil biological activity and, thus, C and N turn-over, while the effect of UV-B would be the opposite. At least in the short term, the "homogenizing influence" of fire would probably have a stronger effect on the C and N cycles than the expected changes in UV and rainfall levels.

TI  - On the magnitude of positive feedback between future climate change and the carbon cycle - art. no. 1405
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - [1] We use an ocean-atmosphere general circulation model coupled to land and ocean carbon models to simulate the evolution of climate and atmospheric CO2 from 1860 to 2100. Our model reproduces the observed global mean temperature changes and the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 for the period 1860-2000. For the future, we simulate that the climate change due to CO2 increase will reduce the land carbon uptake, leaving a larger fraction of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere. By 2100, we estimate that atmospheric CO2 will be 18% higher due to the climate change impact on the carbon cycle. Such a positive feedback has also been found by Cox et al. [2000]. However, the amplitude of our feedback is three times smaller than the one they simulated. We show that the partitioning between carbon stored in the living biomass or in the soil, and their respective sensitivity to increased CO2 and climate change largely explain this discrepancy.

TI  - The role of different exogenous NO concentrations on C and N biogeochemistry of an agricultural soil
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The signaling compound nitric oxide (NO) might play an important, yet unquantified role in mediating soil biogeochemical Carbon and Nitrogen cycles. This study quantified the effects of different soil-typical exogenous NO concentrations on the microbial community, on fertilizer N turnover, and on C and N trace gas fluxes of agricultural soil. For this, we repeatedly established soil NO concentrations of either 0, 200, 400, and ppbv-NO in soil mesocosms for in total of 12 days, followed by high-resolution automated measurements of CO2, NO, CH4, and N2O fluxes, molecular analysis of microbial community composition and 15N-isotope-tracing based assessment of fertilizer N turnover. We found no effects of different NO levels on microbial communities and CO2, CH4, and NO fluxes. However, at 200 ppbv concentration, exogenous NO promoted microbial assimilation of fertilizer N. In contrast, at 400 ppbv-NO concentration, microbial biomass N was reduced, and microbial uptake of fertilizer N was inhibited, accompanied by a 33% reduction of N2O emissions. This suggested a promoting effect of 200 ppbv-NO on the physiology of cells involved in heterotrophic microbial N turnover, probably reinforcing the role of cell-endogenous NO. In contrast, the higher exogenous NO concentrations of 400 ppbv seemed to inhibit heterotrophic microbial inorganic N assimilation, with however no increase in N2O emissions due to detoxification mechanisms. In conclusion, our pioneering study provides first insights into impacts of exogenous NO on soil C and N biogeochemistry in natural soil systems and reveals a NO concentration-dependent regulation of microbial N retention.

TI  - Winter cover crop legacy effects on litter decomposition act through litter quality and microbial community changes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - In agriculture, winter cover crop (WCC) residues are incorporated into the soil to improve soil quality, as gradual litter decomposition can improve fertility. Decomposition rate is determined by litter quality, local soil abiotic and biotic properties. How these factors are interlinked and influenced by cropping history is, however, unclear. We grew WCC monocultures and mixtures in rotation with main crops Avena sativa (oat) and Cichorium endivia (endive) and tested how crop rotation influences WCC litter quality, abiotic and biotic soil conditions, and litter decomposition rates. To disentangle WCC litter quality effects from WCC soil legacy effects on decomposition, we tested how rotation history influences decomposition of standard substrates and explored the underlying mechanisms. In a common environment (e.g. winter fallow plots), WCC decomposition rate constants (k) correlated negatively with litter C, lignin and, surprisingly, N content, due to strong positive correlations among these traits. Plots with a history of fast-decomposing WCCs exhibited faster decomposition of their own litters as well as of the standard substrates filter paper and rooibos tea, as compared to winter fallow plots. WCC treatments differentially affected soil microbial biomass, as well as soil organic matter and mineral nitrogen content. WCC-induced soil changes affected decomposition rates. Depending on the main crop rotation treatment, legacy effects were attributed to biomass input of WCCs and their litter quality or changes in microbial biomass. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that decomposition in cropping systems is influenced directly through crop residues, as well as through crop-induced changes in soil biotic properties. Rotation history influences decomposition, wherein productive winter cover crops (WCC) with low lignin content decompose fast and stimulate the turnover of both own and newly added residues via their knock-on effect on the soil microbial community. Thus, WCC have promise for sustainable carbon- and nutrient-cycling management through litter feedbacks.

TI  - The role of ectomycorrhizal communities in forest ecosystem processes: New perspectives and emerging concepts
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - The fungal symbionts forming ectomycorrhizas, as well as their associated bacteria, benefit forest trees in a number of ways although the most important is enhancing soil nutrient mobilization and uptake. This is reciprocated by the allocation of carbohydrates by the tree to the fungus through the root interface, making the relationship a mutualistic association. Many field observations suggest that ectomycorrhizal fungi contribute to a number of key ecosystem functions such as carbon cycling, nutrient mobilization from soil organic matter, nutrient mobilization from soil minerals, and linking trees through common mycorrhizal networks. Until now, it has been very difficult to study trees and their fungal associates in forest ecosystems and most of the work on ECM functioning has been done in laboratory or nursery conditions. In this review with discuss the possibility of working at another scale, in forest settings. Numerous new techniques are emerging that makes possible the in situ study of the functional diversity of ectomycorrhizal communities. This approach should help to integrate developing research on the functional ecology of ectomycorrhizas and their associated bacteria with the potential implications of such research for managing the effects of climate change on forests.

TI  - Fungivorous nematodes drive microbial diversity and carbon cycling in soil
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Soil bacteria and fungi mediate terrestrial biogeochemical cycling, but we know relatively little about how trophic interactions influence their community composition, diversity, and function. Specifically, it is unclear how consumer populations affect the activity of microbial taxa they consume, and therefore the interaction of those taxa with other members of the microbial community. Due to its extreme diversity, studying trophic dynamics in soil is a complex feat. Seeking to address these challenges, we performed a microcosm-based consumer manipulation experiment to determine the impact of a common fungal-feeding nematode (Aphelenchus avenae) on soil microbial community composition, diversity, and activity (e.g., C cycling parameters). Fungivory decreased fungal and bacterial alpha-diversity and stimulated C and N cycling, possibly via cascading impacts of fungivory on bacterial communities. Our results present experimental evidence that soil trophic dynamics are intimately linked with microbial diversity and function, factors that are key in understanding global patterns in biogeochemical cycling.

TI  - Compost mediates the recruitment of core bacterial communities in alfalfa roots to enhance their productivity potential in saline-sodic soils
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction Composting is one of the effective environmental protection and sustainable measures for improving soil quality and increasing crop yield. However, due to the special physical and chemical properties of saline-sodic soil and the complex rhizosphere microecological environment, the potential mechanism of regulating plant growth after applying compost in saline-sodic soil remains elusive.Methods Here, we investigated the effects of different compost addition rates (0, 5, 15, 25%) on plant growth traits, soil chemical properties, and rhizosphere bacterial community structure.Results The results showed that compost promoted the accumulation of plant biomass and root growth, increased soil nutrients, and enhanced the diversity and complexity of the rhizosphere bacterial communities. Moreover, the enriched core bacterial ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variants) in compost treatment could be reshaped, mainly including dominant genera, such as Pseudomonas, Devosia, Novosphingobium, Flavobacterium, and Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium. The functions of these ASVs were energy resources and nitrogen cycle functions, suggesting the roles of these ASVs in improving plant root nutrient resource acquisition for alfalfa growth. The contents of available potassium, available phosphorus, total nitrogen, and organic carbon of the soil surrounding the roots, the root length, root surface area, root volume, and root tips affected the abundance of the core bacterial ASVs, and the soil chemical properties contributed more to the effect of plant biomass.Discussion Overall, our study strengthens the understanding of the potentially important taxa structure and function of plant rhizosphere bacteria communities, and provides an important reference for developing agricultural microbiome engineering techniques to improve root nutrient uptake and increase plant productivity in saline-sodic soils.

TI  - Distribution and key influential factors of comammox in drained and waterlogged soils of zoige plateau peatland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Peatlands are important carbon and nitrogen reservoirs, playing crucial roles in nitrogen cycling. During microbially-driven nitrogen cycling, nitrous oxide (N2O, 298 times global warming potential of CO2) can be emitted, exacerbating global warming. Complete ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (comammox), a newly discovered group of prokaryotes, can independently oxidize ammonia directly to nitrate, bypassing the nitrite stage, and thereby reducing N2O production associated with the traditional two-step nitrification process. However, information on comammox distribution and its key influential factors in plateau peatlands remains scarce. Thus, this study chose Zoige plateau peatland in China to collect soil samples from different soil types (drained and waterlogged), across different seasons (non-growing and growing), and at various depth (0-100 cm) to assess comammox abundance and community composition. Additionally, soil properties were analyzed and correlated with comammox abundance and community composition to identify the key factors affecting comammox distribution. Comammox abundance varied significantly across soil types, depth, and sampling seasons. Waterlogged soils demonstrated higher comammox abundance than drained soils. In waterlogged soils, comammox abundance showed higher during growing season than non-growing season, while the opposite trend was observed in drained soils. Regardless of soil types, comammox abundance decreased with increasing soil depth. In soils of Zoige plateau peatland, comammox clades A.1, A.2, A.3 and B.1 were identified, with clade B.1 dominating the comammox community. Both Nitrospira sp. CG24A (clade B.1) and Candidatus Nitrospira nitrificans (clade A.1) showed great seasonal variations. Soil properties, including moisture, pH, carbon, and nutrients, collectively influenced comammox abundance and diversity. Among these factors, NH4+-N was the main factor affecting comammox abundance, while moisture primarily drove community distribution. These findings provide valuable insights into comammox distribution, enhancing our understanding of its potential role in mitigating N2O emissions and thus nitrogen cycling in plateau peatland soils.

TI  - Perennial intermediate wheatgrass accumulates more soil organic carbon than annual winter wheat - a model assessment
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - PurposePerennial crops have been suggested as a more sustainable alternative to the currently most common cropping systems. Compared with annual plants, perennial plants produce more biomass and have deeper roots, and are expected to lead to higher soil organic carbon (SOC). This hypothesis, however, has not been well tested for grain crops.MethodsUsing perennial intermediate wheatgrass (IWG, Thinopyrum intermedium) and annual winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) as focal species, and native grassland as reference, we quantified the SOC accumulation via a process-based model, describing water and heat exchanges and carbon-nitrogen cycling in the canopy and soil to a depth of 2 m. The model includes C fixation via photosynthesis, plant biomass growth and litter production, physical protection of SOC, depolymerisation, C mineralisation, nitrification, denitrification, microbial growth, and necromass turnover in the soil. While of general applicability, we considered a sandy loam under warm-summer humid continental climate.ResultsFollowing a conversion from native grassland, IWG reduced SOC losses by at least 38%, especially in the particulate organic carbon (POC) pool, within the top 2 m of soil, compared with annual wheat. Soil microbial biomass and soil respiration were higher in IWG than annual wheat. Shifting from annual wheat to high photosynthetic capacity IWG increased SOC by about 33 g C m-2 y-1 (averaged over a 4-year continuous IWG cropping), with a large fraction of SOC gain stemming from restoring POC.ConclusionCompared with annual grains, perennial grains can increase soil carbon sequestration and maintain SOC at levels nearer to that of native grasslands.

TI  - Assessment of Labile Organic Carbon in Soil Using Sequential Fumigation Incubation Procedures
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
AB  - Management practices and environmental changes can alter soil nutrient and carbon cycling. Soil labile organic carbon, a readily decomposable C pool, is highly sensitive to disturbance. It is also the primary substrate for soil microorganisms, which is fundamental to nutrient cycling. Due to these attributes, labile organic carbon (LOC) has been identified as an indicator parameter for soil health. Quantifying the turnover rate of LOC also aids in understanding changes in soil nutrient cycling processes. A sequential fumigation incubation method has been developed to estimate soil LOC and potential C turnover rate. The method requires fumigating soil samples and quantifying CO2=C respired during a 10 day incubation period over a series of fumigation-incubation cycles. Labile organic C and potential C turnover rate are then extrapolated from accumulated CO2 with a negative exponential model. Procedures for conducting this method are described.

TI  - Mineral nitrogen cycling through earthworm casts in a grazed pasture under elevated atmospheric CO2
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - We used the New Zealand grazed pasture free air CO2 enrichment experiment to determine the effects of elevated CO2 on earthworm (Aporrectodea caliginosa and Lumbricus rubellus) cast production and mineral nitrogen (N) concentration over a 5-week period in the spring. Elevated CO2 did not affect earthworm biomass or the amount of cast material produced. However, cast mineral N concentrations were 18% lower, resulting in 27% less mineral N being deposited on the soil surface under elevated CO2. An analysis of the earthworms' potential diet showed that a reduction in the N content of sheep dung at elevated CO2 was the most likely cause of the lower cast N concentrations. Earthworm casts made only a small contribution to mineral N cycling in our system; however, their quality may act as a sensitive indicator of reduced N availability under elevated CO2 which is consistent with the hypothesised process of progressive N limitation.

TI  - Microbial functional CO2 emissions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are two main greenhouse gases that play important roles in global warming. Studies have shown that microplastics, biochar, and earthworms can significantly affect soil greenhouse gas emissions. However, few studies have explored how their interactions affect soil CO2 and N2O emissions. A mesocosm experiment was conducted to investigate their interactive effects on soil greenhouse gases and soil microbial functional genes in vegetable-growing soil under different incubation times. Biochar alone or combined with microplastics significantly decreased soil CO2 emissions but had no effect on soil N2O emissions. Microplastics and biochar inhibited CO2 emissions and promoted N2O emissions in the soil with earthworms. The addition of microplastics, biochar, and earthworms had significant effects on soil chemical properties, including dissolved organic carbon, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, and pH. Microplastics and earthworms selectively influenced microbial abundances and led to a fungi-prevalent soil microbial community, while biochar led to a bacteria-prevalent microbial community. The interactions of microplastics, biochar, and earthworms could alleviate the reduction of the bacteria-to-fungi ratio and the abundance of microbial functional genes caused by microplastics and earthworms alone. Microplastics significantly inhibited microorganisms as well as C and N cycling functional genes in earthworm guts, while biochar obviously stimulated them. The influence of the addition of exogenous material on soil greenhouse gas emissions, soil chemical properties, and functional microbes differed markedly with soil incubation time. Our results indicated that biochar is a promising amendment for soil with microplastics or earthworms to simultaneously mitigate CO2 emissions and regulate soil microbial community composition and function. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interaction effects of microplastics, biochar, and earthworms on soil carbon and nitrogen cycles, which could be used to help conduct sustainable environmental management of soil.

T2  - MENDELNET 2011
CP  - International Ph.D. Students Conference on MendelNet 2011
AB  - The aim of this thesis was to describle the carbon cycle, focusing on the role of microorganisms in carbon transformations. The laboratory experiment was made outside of the literary part, which examined the intensity of respiration of enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus on Salatin habitat in the Western Tatras. The intensity of basal and potential respiration by collecting the carbon dioxide respirated on natrocalcite was then studied on these samples. It was proved that the strongest microbial activity took place in the soil samples fertilized by phosphorus. On the contrary, the supply of nitrogen led to a lower utilization rate by microorganisms, which were then no longer able to respond by higher intensity of respiration even if easily degradable organic matter was suppied. It was also proved that the microorganisms are able to utilize available nitrogen by immobilization in their biomass and thus prevent its leaching potential if the phosphorous is added.

TI  - Rhizosphere carbon reaction in response to wildfire smoke deposition
T2  - BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS
AB  - Global forest fires frequently occur and have significant impacts on ecosystems carbon fluxes. Biomass combustion produces a large amount of smoke and carbon emissions, which combine with atmospheric water vapor and droplets to create wet deposition of smoke into the ecosystem. The carbon cycle process between roots and soil serves as a vital link between plants and soil. However, it remains largely unexplored how the smoke deposition from forest fires affects the carbon reaction processes between roots and soil. Thus, this study simulated different concentrations of smoke deposition by applying wildfire smoke to the plant rhizosphere to investigate how plant roots and rhizosphere soil respond to "exogenous" smoke deposition under varying smoke concentration treatments. Our results indicate that smoke deposition reduced the abundance of functional genes related to microbial carbon fixation pathways in the rhizosphere soil while increasing the abundance of genes related to carbon degradation pathways. High-concentration smoke deposition led to a downregulation of root carbon reaction genes and root exudate over time. Structural equation modeling (SEM) further revealed that smoke deposition indirectly regulated root carbon reaction processes by influencing the carbon reaction process in the rhizosphere soil. Overall, our study provides useful insights and scientific evidence for understanding the impact of forest fire on the carbon cycle in forest ecosystems.

TI  - Ammonia oxidizing archaea and bacteria respond dynamically to drought in rewetted fen peatlands
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The impact of drought on ammonia oxidizing microbes (AOM) in peatlands remains unclear, despite their role in facilitating a rate-limiting step in nitrification and the increasing prevalence of drought. This study aims to identify trends in ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) responses to summer drought in a rewetted percolation (PW) and coastal fen (CW) in northeastern Germany. AOA and AOB abundances were evaluated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequences and SSU RNA metatranscriptomes. We further quantified amoA gene copies with qPCR and transcript copies with reverse-transcription (RT-)qPCR from in situ peat soil sampled bi-monthly between April 2018 and February 2019. The magnitude of AOM drought response was unexpectedly more pronounced in PW than CW, despite PW exhibiting higher hydrological stability. RT-qPCR showed that PW had an increase in bacterial and archaeal amoA transcript abundances during drought. Additionally, there was evidence in the PW mRNA metatranscriptome for shifts in soil nitrogen cycling, first from a decrease in nitrogen fixation after drought onset, then due to a late-drought increase in assimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium. In contrast, CW had no significant shifts in RT-qPCR amoA transcripts or the nitrogen cycling functional metatranscriptome during the drought. These results suggest that AOM react significantly to drought, responding to changes in soil hydrology and amplifying shifts in nitrogen cycling gene transcription. More frequent droughts will increase the role of AOM in rewetted fens; however, this response may vary between peatland types based on whether the ecosystem is frequently exposed to hydrological changes (such as in coastal fens) or is accustomed to hydrological stability (percolation fens).

TI  - Substrate availability regulates the suppressive effects of Canada goldenrod invasion on soil respiration
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Invasive alien plants not only decrease riparian vegetation diversity but also alter wetland ecosystem carbon processes, especially when they displace the original vegetation. Invasive Canada goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.) has colonized large areas of disturbed and undisturbed land in southeastern China, yet little is known regarding how it affects soil carbon cycling. To explore the response patterns of soil respiration following S. canadensis invasion and their driving mechanisms, an observational field study and a greenhouse experiment simulating invasion were performed. In the field study, soil respiration was measured weekly from 21th July 2018 to 15th December 2018. In the greenhouse experiment, soil, autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration were measured every 1st and 15th of the month from 15th July 2019 to 15th December 2019. Soil, autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration were measured using a closed-chamber system with the deep gauze collar root exclusion method. Solidago canadensis invasion appeared to decrease the total soil CO2 emissions in both the field study and the greenhouse experiment. The suppressive effects on soil respiration may be attributed to S. canadensis invasion-induced alterations in the quality and quantity of available soil substrate, suggesting that S. canadensis invasion may impact soil carbon cycling via plant-released substrates and by competing for the soil available substrate with native plant and/or soil microbes. These results have substantial implications for estimations of the effects of invasive plants on belowground carbon dynamics and their contribution to the warming world.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions and extracellular enzyme activity variability during decomposition of native versus invasive riparian tree litter
T2  - PLANT ECOLOGY
AB  - Invasive plants alter riparian vegetation communities and shift biogeochemical processes by changing decomposition rates and the soil chemical environment created by leaf litter. It is unclear if this mechanism shifts nutrient dynamics favoring invasive dominance; riparian areas in the Southwestern USA invaded by salt cedar and Russian olive often still host mixed stands of native plants. To test the hypothesis that invasive plant success is related to altered litter inputs, microbial activity and nutrient cycling, we performed laboratory incubations examining greenhouse gas emissions and microbial extracellular enzyme activity (EEA). The responses of GHG flux and EAA were measured from decomposing translocated litter from native and invasive woody perennials between soils where they were growing. Litter decomposition from two invasive species (salt cedar and Russian olive) and two native trees (coyote willow and Fremont cottonwood) were tracked for 3 months. Soil respiration, carbon content and EEA were all more closely related to soil origin than leaf litter species. The highest decomposition rate was from willow soil. Soil nitrate at the end of the experiment was highest for soils collected under cottonwood. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were significantly greater from Russian olive litter than other species, on all soil types. Patterns observed here suggest that (1) plant influences on local soil properties over the lifetime of a plant have a greater control on decomposition processes than short-term litter input source, (2) EEA is strongly related to available C resources, and (3) the invasive shrub Russian olive may be responsible for previously undocumented large N2O emissions in riparian systems in the USA.

TI  - Minerals function as signals to modulate microbial adaptation
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Minerals are pivotal environmental factors influencing the adaptation and evolution of microbial communities. Conventional wisdom has long regarded the impact of minerals as a byproduct of their role in providing nutrients and energy to organisms, largely overlooking the significance of non-nutritive and energy-neutral mineral species. In this study, we explore the influence of minerals on microbial development in nutrient- and energy-rich media through a serial passage evolution experiment. Our results show both the inert mineral kaolinite and the energy/nutrient-rich olivine exert evident effects on the microorganisms. Both minerals induced substantial shifts in community structure. Notably, kaolinite and olivine selectively enriched specific taxa, including Acinetobacter and Clostridium. Metatranscriptomic analyses revealed substantial changes in gene expression, with both minerals enriching unique metabolic pathways. Interestingly, kaolinite specifically enriched pathways related to streptomycin biosynthesis. Both minerals stimulated the expression of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), particularly those associated with multidrug and macrolide resistance. Furthermore, both minerals induced the upregulation of genes involved in the degradation of complex organic matter, highlighting their potential role in soil carbon cycling. These findings underscore the intricate interplay between minerals and microbes, challenging the conventional notion that minerals function solely as material sources for organism growth.

TI  - Compositional and abundance changes of nitrogen-cycling genes in plant-root microbiomes along a salt marsh chronosequence
T2  - ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY
AB  - Disentangling the relative influences of soil properties and plant-host on root-associated microbiomes in natural systems is challenging, given that spatially segregated soil types display distinct historical legacies. In addition, distant locations may also lead to biogeographical patterns of microbial communities. Here, we used an undisturbed salt marsh chronosequence spanning over a century of ecosystem development to investigate changes in the community composition and abundance of a set of nitrogen-cycling genes. Specifically, we targeted genes of diazotrophs and ammonia oxidizers associated with the bulk and rhizosphere soil of the plant species Limonium vulgare. Samples were collected across five distinct successional stages of the chronosequence (ranging from 5 to 105years) at two time-points. Our results indicate that soil variables such as sand:silt:clay % content and pH strongly relates to the abundance of N-cycling genes in the bulk soil. However, in the rhizosphere samples, the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing organisms (both bacteria and archaea, AOB and AOA, respectively) was relatively constant across most of the successional stages, albeit displaying seasonal variation. This result indicates a potentially stronger control of plant host (rather than soil) on the abundance of these organisms. Interestingly, the plant host did not have a significant effect on the composition of AOA and AOB communities, being mostly divergent according to soil successional stages. The abundance of diazotrophic communities in rhizosphere samples was more affected by seasonality than those of bulk soil. Moreover, the abundance pattern of diazotrophs in the rhizosphere related to the systematic increase of plant biomass and soil organic matter along the successional gradient. These results suggest a potential season-dependent regulation of diazotrophs exerted by the plant host. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of how the natural formation of a soil and host plants influence the compositional and abundance changes of nitrogen-cycling genes in bulk and rhizosphere soil microhabitats.

TI  - Simulation of nitrous oxide emissions at field scale using the SPACSYS model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Nitrous oxide emitted to the atmosphere via the soil processes of nitrification and denitrification plays an important role in the greenhouse gas balance of the atmosphere and is involved in the destruction of stratospheric ozone. These processes are controlled by biological, physical and chemical factors such as growth and activity of microbes, nitrogen availability, soil temperature and water availability. A comprehensive understanding of these processes embodied in an appropriate model can help develop agricultural mitigation strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help with estimating emissions at landscape and regional scales. A detailed module to describe the denitrification and nitrification processes and nitrogenous gas emissions was incorporated into the SPACSYS model to replace an earlier module that used a simplified first-order equation to estimate denitrification and was unable to distinguish the emissions of individual nitrogenous gases. A dataset derived from a Scottish grassland experiment in silage production was used to validate soil moisture in the top 10 cm soil, cut biomass, nitrogen offtake and N2O emissions. The comparison between the simulated and observed data suggested that the new module can provide a good representation of these processes and improve prediction of N2O emissions. The model provides an opportunity to estimate gaseous N emissions under a wide range of management scenarios in agriculture, and synthesises our understanding of the interaction and regulation of the processes.

TI  - Sugar maple and nitrogen cycling in the forests of eastern North America
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is the most dominant and widely distributed tree species of the northern hardwood forests of the northeastern US and southeastern Canada. Recent studies have shown that sugar maple is also a unique and critical species with regard to nitrogen cycling in forest ecosystems, because forest stands dominated by sugar maple tend to have high rates of nitrification and nitrate leaching to surface waters. In some areas, sugar maple populations may be increasing due to reduction of one of their main competitors, American beech (Fagus grandifolia). However, several factors threaten populations of sugar maple in the near future, including acid deposition, climate change, and the introduction of a new insect pest. Changes in the abundance of sugar maple could lead to major alterations in nitrogen retention by forested watersheds in eastern North America.

TI  - Thermal adaptation of soil microbial respiration to elevated temperature
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
AB  - In the short-term heterotrophic soil respiration is strongly and positively related to temperature. In the long-term, its response to temperature is uncertain. One reason for this is because in field experiments increases in respiration due to warming are relatively short-lived. The explanations proposed for this ephemeral response include depletion of fast-cycling, soil carbon pools and thermal adaptation of microbial respiration. Using a > 15 year soil warming experiment in a mid-latitude forest, we show that the apparent 'acclimation' of soil respiration at the ecosystem scale results from combined effects of reductions in soil carbon pools and microbial biomass, and thermal adaptation of microbial respiration. Mass-specific respiration rates were lower when seasonal temperatures were higher, suggesting that rate reductions under experimental warming likely occurred through temperature-induced changes in the microbial community. Our results imply that stimulatory effects of global temperature rise on soil respiration rates may be lower than currently predicted.

TI  - Distinct carbon fractions drive a generalisable two-pool model of fungal necromass decomposition
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Fungi represent a rapidly cycling pool of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soils. Understanding of how this pool impacts soil nutrient availability and organic matter fluxes is hindered by uncertainty regarding the dynamics and drivers of fungal necromass decomposition.
   Here we assessed the generality of common models for predicting mass loss during fungal necromass decomposition and linked the resulting parameters to necromass substrate chemistry. We decomposed 28 different types of fungal necromass in laboratory microcosms over a 90-day period, measuring mass loss on all types, and N release on a subset of types. We characterised the initial chemistry of each necromass type using: (a) fibre analysis methods commonly used for plant tissues, (b) initial melanin and nitrogen (N) concentrations and (c) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to assess the presence of bonds associated with common biomolecules.
   We found universal support for an asymptotic model of decomposition, which assumes that fungal necromass consists of an exponentially decomposing 'fast' pool, and a 'slow' pool that decomposes at a rate approaching zero. The strongest predictor of the fast pool decay rate (k) was the proportion of cell soluble components, though initial N concentration also predicted k, albeit more weakly. The size of the slow pool was best predicted by the acid non-hydrolysable fraction, which was positively correlated with melanin-associated aromatics. Nitrogen dynamics varied by necromass type, ranging from net N release to net immobilisation. The maximum quantity of N immobilised was inversely related to cell soluble contents and k, as positively related to FTIR spectra associated with cell wall polysaccharides.
   Collectively, our results indicate that the decomposition of fungal necromass in soils can be described as having two distinct stages that are driven by different components of substrate C chemistry, with implications for rates of N availability and organic matter accumulation in soils.

TI  - Effects of a clear-cut on the in situ nitrogen mineralisation and the nitrogen cycle in a 67-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) plantation
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - In situ net nitrogen mineralisation, deposition, uptake and leaching fluxes were determined in a 67-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) plantation in the Beaujolais mountains. Measurements were performed during five years before the clear-cut of the stand and two years after the clear-cut. Deposition and mineralisation of N decreased after the harvest. The drastic decrease in tree N uptake was counteracted by the developing understorey vegetation. Microbial immobilisation, favoured by the input of organic matter and the increase in temperature, was probably the cause of a decrease in the net mineralisation of N. Leaching of mineral N at 15 cm depth decreased after the harvest. However, fluxes of Mg and Ca leached at 60 cm depth did not vary after the harvest.

TI  - Successional patterns of key genes and processes involved in the microbial nitrogen cycle in a salt marsh chronosequence
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Here, we investigated the patterns of microbial nitrogen cycling communities along a chronosequence of soil development in a salt marsh. The focus was on the abundance and structure of genes involved in N fixation (nifH), bacterial and archaeal ammonium oxidation (amoA; AOB and AOA), and the abundances of genes involved in denitrification (nirS, nirK, nosZ). Potential nitrification and denitrification activities were also measured, and increases in nitrification were found in soils towards the end of succession, whereas denitrification became maximal in soils at the intermediate stages. The nifH, nirK and nirS gene markers revealed increases in the sizes of the respective functional groups towards the intermediate stage (35 years), remaining either constant (for nifH) or slightly declining towards the latest stage of succession (for nirK and nirS). Moreover, whereas the AOB abundance peaked in soils at the intermediate stage, that of AOA increased linearly along the chronosequence. The abundance of nosZ was roughly constant, with no significant regression. The drivers of changes in abundance and structure were identified using path analysis; whereas the ammonia oxidizers (AOA and AOB) showed patterns that followed mainly N availability, those of the nitrogen fixers followed plant diversity and soil structure. The patterns of denitrifiers were group-dependent, following the patterns of plant diversity (nirK and nirS) and belowground shifts (nosZ). The variation observed for the microbial groups associated with the same function highlights their differential contribution at different stages of soil development, revealing an interplay of changes in terms of niche complementarity and adaptation to the local environment.

TI  - Ecological Perspectives on Microbes Involved in N-Cycling
T2  - MICROBES AND ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - Nitrogen (N) cycles have been directly linked to the functional stability of ecosystems because N is an essential element for life. Furthermore, the supply of N to organisms regulates primary productivity in many natural ecosystems. Microbial communities have been shown to significantly contribute to N cycles because many N-cycling processes are microbially mediated. Only particular groups of microbes were implicated in N-cycling processes, such as nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification, until a few decades ago. However, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies and -sophisticated isolation techniques have enabled microbiologists to discover that N-cycling microbes are unexpectedly diverse in their functions and phylogenies. Therefore, elucidating the link between biogeochemical N-cycling processes and microbial community dynamics can provide a more mechanistic understanding of N cycles than the direct observation of N dynamics. In this review, we summarized recent findings that characterized the microbes governing novel N-cycling processes. We also discussed the ecological role of N-cycling microbial community dynamics, which is essential for advancing our understanding of the functional stability of ecosystems.

TI  - Decline in a dominant invertebrate species contributes to altered carbon cycling in a low-diversity soil ecosystem
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Low-diversity ecosystems cover large portions of the Earth's land surface, yet studies of climate change on ecosystem functioning typically focus on temperate ecosystems, where diversity is high and the effects of individual species on ecosystem functioning are difficult to determine. We show that a climate-induced decline of an invertebrate species in a low-diversity ecosystem could contribute to significant changes in carbon (C) cycling. Recent climate variability in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica is associated with changes in hydrology, biological productivity, and community composition of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. One of the greatest changes documented in the dry valleys is a 65% decrease in the abundance of the dominant soil invertebrate (Scottnema lindsayae, Nematoda) between 1993 and 2005, illustrating sensitivity of biota in this ecosystem to small changes in temperature. Globally, such declines are expected to have significant influences over ecosystem processes such as C cycling. To determine the implications of this climate-induced decline in nematode abundance on soil C cycling we followed the fate of a C-13 tracer added to soils in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Carbon assimilation by the dry valley nematode community contributed significantly to soil C cycling (2-7% of the heterotrophic C flux). Thus, the influence of a climate-induced decline in abundance of a dominant species may have a significant effect on ecosystem functioning in a low-diversity ecosystem.

TI  - Linking plant identity and interspecific competition to soil nitrogen cycling through ammonia oxidizer communities
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Both plants and microbes influence soil nutrient cycling. However, the links between plants, microbes and nutrient cycling are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how plant identity and interspecific competition influence soil nitrogen cycling and attempted to link plant identity and interspecific competition to community structures of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers based on terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (T-RFLP) of bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) genes. Faba bean and maize monocultures and a faba bean/maize mixture were planted with two nitrogen levels (0 and 100 mg N kg(-1) soil as urea). Soil mineral nitrogen, ammonia oxidizer function (potential nitrification activity, PNA) and community structures were measured 28 and 54 days after plant emergence. Faba bean and maize substantially differed in their influences on mineral nitrogen concentrations and PNA in rhizosphere soils. Soil mineral nitrogen and PNA in the rhizosphere soils of the faba bean/maize mixture were closer to those of the maize monoculture than to those of the faba bean monoculture. T-RFLP with restriction enzymes BsaJI and Hpy81 distinguished variations in bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers community structure, respectively, and detected both between-cluster and within-cluster variations in bacterial ammonia oxidizers. T-RFLP data showed that nitrogen addition favored part of a Nitrosospira cluster 3b sequence type and suppressed part of a cluster Nitrosospira 3a sequence type of bacterial ammonia oxidizers, while it had no influence on the archaeal ammonia oxidizer community structure. Although multivariate analysis showed that the function and community structure of bacterial ammonia oxidizers were significantly correlated, plant species and interspecific competition did not significantly change the community structure of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers. These results indicate that plant species and interspecific competition regulate soil nitrogen cycling via a mechanism of other than alteration in the community structure of ammonia oxidizers as investigated by DNA based methods.

TI  - Effect of fire disturbance on active organic carbon of Larix gmelinii forest soil in Northeastern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
AB  - Active organic carbon in soil has high biological activity and plays an important role in forest soil ecosystem structure and function. Fire is an important disturbance factor in many forest ecosystems and occurs frequently over forested soils. However, little is known about its impact on soil active organic carbon (SAOC), which is important to the global carbon cycle. To investigate this issue, we studied the active organic carbon in soils in the Larix gmelinii forests of the Da Xing'an Mountains (Greater Xing'an Mountains) in Northeastern China, which had been burned by high-intensity wildfire in two different years (2002 and 2008). Soil samples were collected monthly during the 2011 growing season from over 12 sample plots in burned and unburned soils and then analyzed to examine the dynamics of SAOC. Our results showed that active organic carbon content changed greatly after fire disturbance in relation to the amount of time elapsed since the fire. There were significant differences in microbial biomass carbon, dissolved organic carbon, light fraction organic carbon, particulate organic carbon between burned and unburned sample plots in 2002 and 2008 (p < 0.05). The correlations between active organic carbon and environmental factors such as water content, pH value and temperature of soils, and correlations between each carbon component changed after fire disturbance, also in relation to time since the fire. The seasonal dynamics of SAOC in all of the sample plots changed after fire disturbance; peak values appeared during the growing season. In plots burned in 2002 and 2008, the magnitude and occurrence time of peak values differed. Our findings provide basic data regarding the impact of fire disturbance on boreal forest soil-carbon cycling, carbon-balance mechanisms, and carbon contributions of forest ecosystem after wildfire disturbance.

TI  - Fluxes of greenhouse gases from incubated soils using different lid-closure times
T2  - SOIL RESEARCH
AB  - Laboratory incubations and field measurements have provided valuable information on the production of green-house gases. However, information about the effects of pre-incubation and closure time on soil-induced gas emissions is currently limited. Our findings showed that different closure times and pre-incubation times altered gas emissions from incubated soils. A standardised procedure to investigate gas fluxes is needed for application to other studied soils. Different sampling times for greenhouse gas measurements have been proposed in many incubation studies. Little is known about effects of closure time on denitrification and nitrification rates from incubation experiments. The objectives of this study were to analyse greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) production from different soils with different times of lid closure and to assess effects of different activation times (defined as additional pre-incubation periods before incubation experiments) on gas emissions from soils. Forty grams of air-dried soil samples (depth 0-10 cm) were incubated in 125-mL jars at 25 degrees C with the addition of glucose and nitrate. The first experiment measured greenhouse gas fluxes at different lid-closure times (40, 80, 120 and 1440 min). The second experiment assessed the effects of different durations of soil activation (0.7, 1.3, 2 and 24 h) on gas emissions. Both were conducted with a completely randomised design, with three replicates per treatment. Our findings showed closure time <1 h or >2 h may cause an underestimate of greenhouse gas emissions. Lengthening activation times resulted in different emission rates consistent with soil characteristics. To measure gas fluxes based on linear regression would require four or five sampling points and sampling at a 20-min interval over a maximum period of 80 min for estimating gas fluxes from soil. Because pre-incubation time is critical and a driving factor in the measurement of soil-induced gas emissions, a standardised procedure to quantify gas fluxes is needed for application to other soils.

TI  - Amelioration of a saline-alkaline soil using biochar and compost: Impacts on plant growth, soil biological and chemical characteristics
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Land degradation reduces productivity and biodiversity, and requires restoration of both soil condition and vegetation to re-establish ecosystem services. Organic amendments can improve soil biological and chemical properties, thereby enhancing revegetation success in severely degraded soil. This study investigated the use of compost and biochar to support revegetation and soil restoration. Soil was collected from a severely degraded creek bed in an agricultural farm in south-western Australia (UWA Farm Ridgefield) and amended with compost (2.5% and 5%) and biochar (5% and 10%), both alone and in all pairwise combinations. Saltbush (Atriplex nummularia) seedlings were grown for 10 weeks in glasshouse conditions. Following harvest, plant growth and soil chemical properties were analysed. DNA was extracted from rhizosphere soil for bacterial diversity profiling with subsequent putative functional genes relating to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling using an in-silico approach. Compost improved growth of root and shoot biomass. Both compost and biochar improved the alkaline soil by reducing pH and increasing nitrate, phosphorus and potassium levels. Compost addition also had a significant effect on rhizosphere bacterial community structure, decreasing alpha diversity and altering beta diversity indices. Amendment of soil also changed the relative abundance of putative nutrient cycling genes, with an increase in the potential for denitrification, carbon and phosphorus cycling and a decrease in ammonification potential. Application of this compost-biochar combination improved plant growth and soil condition by altering both chemical and biological characteristics of the soil, and therefore may provide an effective management strategy for supporting restoration in a degraded landscape.

TI  - Grazing triggers soil carbon loss by altering plant roots and their control on soil microbial community
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - P>1. Depending on grazing intensity, grasslands tend towards two contrasting systems that differ in terms of species diversity and soil carbon (C) storage. To date, effects of grazing on C cycling have mainly been studied in grasslands subject to constant grazing regimes, whereas little is known for grasslands experiencing a change in grazing intensity. Analysing the transition between C-storing and C-releasing grasslands under low- and high-grazing regimes, respectively, will help to identify key plant-soil interactions for C cycling.
   2. The transition was studied in a mesocosm experiment with grassland monoliths submitted to a change in grazing after 14 years of constant high and low grazing. Plant-soil interactions were analysed by following the dynamics of plant and microbial communities, roots and soil organic matter fractions over 2 years. After disturbance change, mesocosms were continuously exposed to C-13-labelled CO2, which allowed us to trace both the incorporation of new litter C produced by a modified plant community in soil and the fate of old unlabelled litter C.
   3. Changing disturbance intensity led to a cascade of events. After shift to high disturbance, photosynthesis decreased followed by a decline in root biomass and a change in plant community structure 1.5 months later. Those changes led to a decrease of soil fungi, a proliferation of Gram(+) bacteria and accelerated decomposition of old particulate organic C (< 6 months). At last, accelerated decomposition released plant available nitrogen and decreased soil C storage. Our results indicate that intensified grazing triggers proliferation of Gram(+) bacteria and subsequent faster decomposition by reducing roots adapted to low disturbance.
   4. Synthesis. Plant communities exert control on microbial communities and decomposition through the activity of their living roots: slow-growing plants adapted to low disturbance reduce Gram(+) bacteria, decomposition of low and high quality litter, nitrogen availability and, thus, ingress of fast-growing plants. Our results indicate that grazing impacts on soil carbon storage by altering plant roots and their control on the soil microbial community and decomposition, and that these processes will foster decomposition and soil C loss in more productive and disturbed grassland systems.

TI  - Nitrogen dynamics in an Alaskan salt marsh following spring use by geese
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis) use several salt marshes in Cook Inlet, Alaska, as stopover areas for brief periods during spring migration. We investigated the effects of geese on nitrogen cycling processes in Susitna Flats, one of the marshes. We compared net nitrogen mineralization, organic nitrogen pools and production in buried bags, nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria, and soil and litter characteristics on grazed plots versus paired plots that had been exclosed from grazing for 3 years. Grazed areas had higher rates of net nitrogen mineralization in the spring and there was no effect of grazing on organic nitrogen availability. The increased mineralization rates in grazed plots could not be accounted for by alteration of litter quality, litter quantity, microclimate, or root biomass, which were not different between grazed and exclosed plots. In addition, fecal input was very slight in the year that we studied nitrogen cycling. We propose that trampling had two effects that could account for greater nitrogen availability in grazed areas: litter incorporation into soil, resulting in increased rates of decomposition and mineralization of litter material, and greater rates of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria on bare, trampled soils. A path analysis indicated that litter incorporation by trampling played a primary role in the nitrogen dynamics of the system, with nitrogen fixation secondary, and that fecal input was of little importance.

TI  - Continental and Ecoregion-Specific Drivers of Atmospheric NO2 and NH3 Seasonality Over Africa Revealed by Satellite Observations
T2  - GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES
AB  - Ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx: nitrogen dioxide [NO2] + nitric oxide [NO]) play important roles in atmospheric chemistry. Throughout most of Africa, emissions of these gases are predominantly from soils and biomass burning. Here we use observations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument from 2005 through 2017 and atmospheric NH3 VCDs from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer from 2008 through 2017 to evaluate seasonal variation of NO2 and NH3 VCDs across Africa and in seven African ecoregions. In regions where mean annual precipitation (MAP) is under 500 mm yr(-1), we find that NO2 and NH3 VCDs are positively related to monthly precipitation, and where MAP is between 500 and 1,750 mm yr(-1) or higher, NO2 VCDs are negatively related to monthly precipitation. In dry ecoregions, temperature and precipitation were important predictors of NH3 and NO2 VCDs, likely related to variation in soil emissions. In mesic ecoregions, monthly NO2 VCDs were strongly related to burned area, suggesting that biomass burning drives seasonality. NH3 VCDs in mesic ecoregions were positively related to both monthly temperature and monthly carbon monoxide (CO) VCDs, suggesting that a mixture of soil and biomass burning emissions influenced NH3 seasonality. In northern mesic ecoregions, monthly temperature explained most of the variance in monthly NH3 VCDs, suggesting that soil sources, including animal excreta, determined NH3 seasonality. In southern mesic ecoregions, monthly CO VCDs explained more variation in NH3 VCDs than temperature, suggesting that biomass burning may have greater influence over NH3 seasonality.

TI  - The effect of fire affected Pinus radiata litter and char addition on soil nitrogen cycling
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - In pine forest litters, decomposition rate is directly affected by the pathway the needle followed to the ground, whether that was via programmed apoptosis and abscission or via stress induced loss through branch damage or tree death. Stress induced losses may occur due to fire damage, which leads to a post-fire litter layer composed of non-senescent debris that fell during or after the event. This study investigates decomposition and nitrogen cycling in soils amended with two litters from Pinus radiata plantations that had different recent fire histories. Litters were incubated in the presence or absence of field collected char for up to 94 days. These soil treatments were analysed for microbial activity (soil respiration) and N pools (microbial, mineral, and potentially mineralisable). Soil and litter treatments were additionally incubated in the presence of ammonium nitrate solution to determine N absorption potential of the litters. Respiration was greatest in soils that received fire affected (FA) litter regardless of the presence or absence of char. Nitrogen pools were largely similar between the control (no litter) treatment and not fire affected (NFA) litter treatments. Measured N pools were exceedingly low (92% of samples <2 mu g-N g soil(-1) where detected) or not detectable (37% of samples below detection limits) in all FA litter treatments at most times. Char appeared inert throughout and had no effects on microbial activity or nitrogen cycling. This study indicates that fire affected pine litter collected four months post fire has strong N absorption properties with or without the presence of char. The presence of fire affected litter is likely to affect N availability for regeneration of forest growth. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A microbial consortium couples anaerobic methane oxidation to denitrification
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Modern agriculture has accelerated biological methane and nitrogen cycling on a global scale(1,2). Freshwater sediments often receive increased downward fluxes of nitrate from agricultural runoff and upward fluxes of methane generated by anaerobic decomposition(3). In theory, prokaryotes should be capable of using nitrate to oxidize methane anaerobically, but such organisms have neither been observed in nature nor isolated in the laboratory(4-8). Microbial oxidation of methane is thus believed to proceed only with oxygen or sulphate(9,10). Here we show that the direct, anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled to denitrification of nitrate is possible. A microbial consortium, enriched from anoxic sediments, oxidized methane to carbon dioxide coupled to denitrification in the complete absence of oxygen. This consortium consisted of two microorganisms, a bacterium representing a phylum without any cultured species and an archaeon distantly related to marine methanotrophic Archaea. The detection of relatives of these prokaryotes in different freshwater ecosystems worldwide(11-14) indicates that the reaction presented here may make a substantial contribution to biological methane and nitrogen cycles.

TI  - TROPHIC INTERACTIONS AND NITROGEN CYCLING IN A SEMIARID GRASSLAND SOIL .2. SYSTEM RESPONSES TO REMOVAL OF DIFFERENT GROUPS OF SOIL MICROBES OR FAUNA
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - (1) Perturbations were performed on organisms in a below-ground trophic food web in a semi-arid grassland, using five separate biocide treatments to observe changes in trophic structures, interactions, and nutrient cycling. Changes in N mineralization and trophic interactions as predicted on the basis of simple predator-prey microcosm studies were observed following removal of particular groups. (2) Five biocides: streptomycin (bactericide), captan and PCNB (fungicides), carbofuran  (insecticide-nematicide), and cygon (acaricide) were applied in situ to soil in cylinders containing predominantly blue grama grass. The response of microbes, fungal grazers, soil inorganic N and plants were followed monthly between April and October 1982. (3) Grazing of bacteria or fungi by predators resulted in one or more of the following occurrences: (i) increased soil inorganic N, decreased predator populations following reduction of prey or increased plant growth after reduction of  nematodes; (ii) reduction of one group of decomposers, e.g. bacteria, allowed a second decomposer group, e.g., fungi, to increase in numbers; (iii) compensatory responses of microbial feeders, e.g. decreases in bacterial feeders (protozoa and bacterivorous nematodes) were followed by compensatory increases in fungal feeders, which increased following the increase in their fungal food supply. (4) Continuing changes in nitrogen cycling were not observed, presumably because the function of the reduced group was compensated by increased numbers of the second group performing a similar function. Nematode-VAM interactions must be considered in food web and nutrient flows, as the percentage of VAM colonization of plant roots increased markedly when nematode populations were decreased by nematicide treatment. Production of predator biomass was as important as microbial and plant production in determining nutrient flow in this system.

TI  - Saltwater intrusion in context: soil factors regulate impacts of salinity on soil carbon cycling
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Salinization of freshwater ecosystems impacts carbon cycling, a particular concern for coastal wetlands, which are important agents of carbon sequestration. Previous experimental work using salt additions as a proxy for sea level rise, reveals widely divergent effects of salt on soil carbon processes. We performed a laboratory salt addition experiment on two different types of wetland soils (Ponzer muck and Hyde loam, both poorly drained organic soils) from the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. We used a commercial aquarium salt mix to make treatment solutions of 0, 2.5 and 10 ppt salinity and independently manipulated solution pH (5.5, 7.2, 8.8) for a full factorial experimental design. Our goal was to identify the effects of increasing ionic strength and increasing soil solution pH on soil carbon solubility and turnover. Microbial respiration and dissolved organic carbon solubility were depressed by marine salts, while pH manipulation alone had minimal effect. The addition of marine salts substantially reduced rates of carbon mineralization, reduced carbon solubility, and preferentially reduced the abundance of phenolic and aromatic organic molecules in solution. In the more acidic Ponzer muck, where salt additions dropped the pH from > 5 to < 4, we measured more substantial declines in DOC concentrations than in the base saturated Hyde loam. In contrast, in the base saturated Hyde loam, more marine salts remained in solution and the treatment effects on rates of carbon mineralization were more pronounced. Our results provide a clear demonstration of how ion exchange mechanisms result in indirect effects of salinization on the pH of soil solution and the solubility of organic matter. These indirect effects may explain much of the existing variation in reports of salt effects on soil carbon dynamics.
